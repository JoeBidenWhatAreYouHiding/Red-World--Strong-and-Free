 CAN_RED_WORLD_DESC:0 "Canada remains as one of the last beacons of Freedom and Stability in the chaotic Soviet-dominated world. The leader of some of the last few democratic capitalist regimes on the planet, Canada has taken up the mantle of 'Leader of the Free World', flourishing in arenas where Britain and America have failed. While not free from trouble by any stretch of the imagination, 20 years of America's best and brightest fleeing across the border has allowed Canada to assert itself as a great power in its own right. Only time will tell if they can maintain their newfound prowess and take back what has been lost, or if Canada will meet the same fate as their Southern neighbors."

 ### LEADER BIOS ###
 ###################
 
 POLITICS_CAN_PRESTON_MANNING_DESC:0 "Preston Manning, a champion of the conservative and populist values common in Western Canada, founded and led the Reform Party of Canada to many victories in both provincial and federal elections in the decade following the Great American Collapse. For a time it appeared that his party was on course to usurp the Progressive Conservatives as the major right-wing force in the country after Brian Mulroney's disastrous premiership resulted in a landslide victory for the New Democratic Party in 1989. However, the stabilization period after America's demise and NATO's collapse led to mainstream parties experiencing an enormous resurgence, especially the revitalized PCs. After a devastating loss in the 2000 election, Manning resigned as party leader and subsequently dissolved Reform. For many years he remained retired from politics to become simply a footnote in Canada's history, failing to gain enough seats to govern even at his party's height. However, when the Liberal Party became mired by the biggest corruption scandal in Canadian history, Manning was inspired to once again rejoin the political arena and take down the corrupt establishment. In 2003 Manning officially joined the PCs, and after the Liberal-PC coalition government of Paul Martin fell to the NDP in 2006 he was seen as a clear candidate to restore a true conservative vision to the country. Less than a month later PC members elected him as their next party leader, and in 2008 Manning rode the back of a populist wave to finally become prime minister of Canada. The aging leader has a clear vision for the country but the question remains; does he have the time and influence to achieve it?"
 
 POLITICS_CAN_DONALD_TRUMP_DESC:0 "Donald Trump's journey from New York's Fifth Avenue to Ottawa's 24 Sussex Drive has been nothing short of spectacular. Born and raised in the Big Apple, Donald Trump came from money, being the heir to a multi-million dollar real estate operation started by his father: Fred Trump, owner of Trump Management, a firm which owned several racially segregated middle-class rental housing in New York City's outer boroughs. Trump would claim that his business career started when his father gave him 'a small loan of one million dollars', and that he was a millionaire by age eight. By 1971 he was President of the company, and begun the transformation of the Trump brand into the eponymous staple of the pre-collapse United States. While the Trump brand had experienced ups and down, Trump eventually emerged as a household name in both the Big Apple and Atlantic City, coming to operate dozens of hotels, casinos, and other real estate ventures, and accumulating an almost $200 million net worth. Upon the dissolution of the United States, Trump was one of the countless American financiers who fled the collapsing United States, eventually setting up shop with the rest of his brand in Canada. Throughout his years in Canada Trump has assimilated into the greater Canadian social and political scene, learning French and becoming good friends with former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. By 2000 he was at the helm of a failed run for Mayor of Toronto, and was a powerful force financing the Progressive Conservative party. Landing himself in the Prime Minister's office after Preston Manning's resignation, Donald Trump's ascendancy to Prime Minister comes against the background of widespread skepticism by Canadians. Compared often to John Turner, the first Prime Minister since Mackenzie Bowell to not be born in Canada, Donald Trump may seem like a stranger in a strange land. And while Trump can not deny the ire he has drawn from the Canadian political establishment, Trump remains resolute in plans for 'transferring power from Ottawa, and giving it back to you, the people'."
 
 POLITICS_CAN_JUSTIN_TRUDEAU_DESC:0 "In 1972, President John Ashbrook proudly toasted to the 'future prime minister of Canada: Justin Pierre Trudeau' when he was merely four months old. Born into political spotlight, Trudeau has finally fulfilled Ashbrook's prophecy, and has risen as Canada's newest and youngest Prime Minister. Standing at the helm of a re-energized Liberal Party, Trudeau has defied the impossible once more and secured the Liberals' status in the spotlight with a smashing majority government. As the first Prime Minister to be the child of a previous holder of the post, Trudeau thinks of himself as the 'Next Great Liberal Prime Minister', and the only man who can shake off decades of rot both in the Liberal Party and in the Canadian Political Sphere. Empowered by his long-shot victory, this young paragon of the Canadian establishment is determined to restore the power and prestige of the Liberal Party, reinstituting an era of pride that began with Laurier, continued with Mackenzie King and Pearson, and ended with his own father. Likening himself to the great Liberal Prime Ministers of the past, Trudeau sees his election as a beginning of a new Liberal era both in Canada and across the world, defeating both the insidious influences of Manning's 'NeoNeoConservatives' and the vile Soviets who seek to strangle the remaining democratic regimes and movements across the world. However only time will tell if he will be able to see through his grandiose vision for both Canada and the Free World. "
 
 POLITICS_CAN_STEPHEN_HARPER_DESC:0 "Stephen Joseph Harper didn't see himself as a politician, let alone Prime Minister. Disillusioned by both the Trudeau and Mulroney administrations to which he was formerly loyal, Harper was drawn to the Western Canada-centric Conservative movements which arose during the early 80s'. By the time of the Reform Party's foundation Stephen Harper was merely a graduate student in economics at the University of Calgary; however within a year Harper had risen to the Reform Party's Policy Chief, where he played a major role in drafting the 1989 election platform, otherwise known as the Blue Book, which helped form the principles and policies of the party. While his attempts to run for Parliament in the riding of Calgary West were unsuccessful, Harper remained as an influential figure within the Reform Party, serving both as an advisor and speechwriter to several Reform candidates. By 1992 Harper's relationship with Preston Manning became increasingly strained, with the two titans of Canadian Conservatism becoming increasingly at odds over the party's brand and direction. By 2000 Manning had declared the dissolution of the Reform Party, and led an exodus of Reform MPs to the re-energized Progressive Conservatives. This act would permanently drive a wedge between Manning and Harper, as Harper refused these calls for Reform-PC unity, and would instead attempt to establish the Reform Party as a legitimate force across Canadian Politics. This strategy would bear little fruit, and by 2011 it became clear that the Reform Party's continued existence was a detriment to Canadian Conservatism. Eventually groveling to his former mentor, Harper officially dissolved the Reform Party, uniting the Canadian Right under one banner once more. While this merger was seen as paramount to treason by Reform hardliners, the Reform-PC unification would ironically lead to the Reform Party's ideals becoming mainstream. This phenomenon would coalesce with Harper's rise to Prime Minister after Preston Manning's resignation. Now in power, Harper is determined to forge a brand of unspoiled Canadian Conservatism free from both the trappings of the spineless Red Tories and radicals determined to keep the Reform Movement confined to Western Canada only." 
 
 POLITICS_CAN_RALPH_CRUZ_DESC:0 "Rafael Edward 'Ralph' Cruz has made a name for himself as perhaps the most reviled man in the Canadian Political Sphere. Nonetheless, he now stands as the newest leader of a divided and bewildered nation. As the child of a Cuban refugee who fled from the vile regime of Fidel Castro, Cruz has had a hatred of Communism instilled within him since childhood. Born and raised in Calgary, conflict within the Cruz family nearly sent a young Ralph Cruz to Texas - however the weakness of the American Economy would keep the Cruz's up in Calgary where they worked in the oil business as owners of a seismic-data processing firm. Being brought up with a private education focused on the Free Market and Public Policy, Cruz's prowess in debate would set the stage for his later entry into the Canadian political scene. Later, Cruz would attend class in the University of Toronto where he studied law, and would eventually come to operate a successful private practice. By the time of the United States' fall, Cruz became active in the up-and-coming Reform Party, serving as an aide and advisor to Stephen Harper on a wide range of policy and legal matters. Elected to Parliament in 1993, Cruz would prevail as one of the few remaining Reform MPs who refused to join Preston Manning after he announced his intention to dissolve the Reform Party. As one of the few stalwarts who refused to follow over to the PCs, Cruz’s continuing opposition to any such attempts at reconciliation between the PCs and Reform would make him deeply unpopular to both sides in the Canadian Political Scene. When Harper finally conceded to the PCs, Cruz led the final bitter remnants of the Reform Party to form the 'Canadian Alliance', a hard-right party which would never concede to the spineless establishment. And after almost a decade of PC failures, the Canadian Alliance has finally gained enough sway to form a narrow Minority Government.\n\n While Cruz has seen his life's work come to fruition as Prime Minister of Canada, his uncompromising attitude and radical stances against seemingly the entire Canadian political scene, combined with his virulent unpopularity may serve to complicate Cruz's plans for the future of Canada."
 
 POLITICS_CAN_BOB_RAE_DESC:0 "Robert Keith 'Bob' Rae is a man who is many different things to many different people. His tenure as Premier of Ontario was met with its fair share of successes and failures, and ultimately ended up with a bitter conflict within the NDP bubbling up to the surface. The implementation of the cutbacks which led to the Ontario NDP falling-out with both the public sector unions, and the Canadian Auto Workers Union. Despite this, Rae's support of the NDP during the Broadbent years solidified his status within the party, setting the stage for Rae's eventual transition to Federal-level politics. Defeating Jack Layton in the 2003 NDP Leadership Election, Layton and Rae have been bitterly at each-other's throats ever since. When Rae was swept into the Prime Minister's office in 2005, Layton led a caucus revolt against Rae's 'diluted' NDP, and forced Rae to rely on the rump Liberals to keep his government intact. Losing to Preson Manning in 2008, Bob Rae was returned to the Prime Minister's Seat in 2011. Despite constant challenges from Layton and the NDP's Socialist 'Waffle' Wing, Rae remains committed to defending his Second Term as separate from the chaos of his first. However the question remains if he can follow through. To detractors Rae only seeks to complete the NDP's long path down the road from Democratic Socialism to watered-down Liberalism; and simply opting to wear the skin of the once-defeated Canadian establishment. To many, Rae's victory is the final stop in a road which started at the Winnipeg Manifesto, and ended with the NDP shedding its many union affiliations simply to appease the will of Big Business. However Rae's supporters see him as the man to defeat the evils of Radical Socialism worldwide, and establish the NDP as a moderate force which can triumph over the evils of Godless Communism both in Canada and the world stage."
 
 POLITICS_CAN_JACK_LAYTON_DESC:0 "In an era of Canadian politics increasingly defined by bitterness and anger, Jack Layton stands out a beacon of hope and positivity in a world consumed by hatred. John Gilbert Layton was the grandson of a cabinet minister in the Government of Quebec Premier Maurice Duplessis, and the son of ProgCon MP Robert Layton. Growing up in an Anglophone suburb of Montreal, Layton's first elected position would be that of Student Council President, later leaving to serve as Prime Minister of the Quebec Youth Parliament. After graduating from McGill, Layton would go on to develop close links with many influential figures in Toronto Civic Politics, eventually landing him a spot on the Toronto City Council. An early champion of many Progressive Causes, Layton's activism would make him both many enemies and many friends, and would lead Layton to become de-facto leader of a coalescing left-wing coalition on the Toronto City Council. And while he would never become Mayor, Layton would catch the attention of the NDP the nation over with his charisma and Progressive bend. By 2003 Layton was a shoo-in for Federal NDP leader, being prominently backed by Ed Broadbent; however this ill-fated attempt would be defeated by former Ontario Premier Bob Rae, who united many center-left voters against Layton with baseless claims of Communist links. Despite this, 2003 would become the year where Layton became a household name in Canada, and put him at the center of a growing movement of NDP voters dissatisfied with the party's rightward shift. After the election of Bob Rae, Layton would come to lead a Backbench Revolt against Rae for pushing certain policies deemed to be anti-union. This event would force Rae to rely on the Liberals to stay afloat, and would ultimately see the return of the Progressive Conservatives in 2008. After the 'Layton Affair', Rae would admit defeat and resign as NDP leader; paving the way for a smashing comeback by Layton. Now Prime Minister, Layton stands resolute in his determination to keep the NDP from becoming just like the establishment they fought so hard to uproot. In a voice echoed by voters across Canada, Layton has declared that enough is enough with Liberal arrogance and scandals and enough to the vote-buying promises of the Conservatives. There's a better choice, a third option, the NDP."

While the United States has been swept into the dustbin of history, and Britain refuses the call, Canada along with the scattered remnants of the world's Democratic and Capitalist regimes keep up their resistance against Soviet Hegemony. Forced to shoulder the responsibilities of the old United States, Canada will remain steadfast, the last line of defense against Communism. We stand On Guard for Thee, ready to liberate the fallen world once the time comes, or to defend against Soviet Tyranny if they decide to once more incur in the New World.\n\n Our icy cold slice of this blue marble shall always remain free, against all the world; Canada will remain the True North: Strong and Free.

In lieu of the highly unstable former United States, the remnants of American Big Business decided to resettle in Canada, taking their wealth and industrial prowess with them. The flight of American Business, while transforming Canada in to an industrial and financial powerhouse, has also infected Canada with a prevailing culture of corruption. The cutthroat world of American Business has sunk its teeth in to Canada, and it appears that for now, the American Corporations have enough funds at their disposal to effortlessly manipulate the Canadian Government into doing their bidding, or simply turning a blind eye to their less than legal practices.

Thousands of Refugees in the border cities fled to Canada in hopes of escaping the coming violence, and to make new lives over the border. This first wave of Refugees from the borderlands was followed soon by countless more coming from the rest of America. While at first they were met with RCMP Officers in Dress Uniforms, and friendly locals greeting them with Tim Hortons Coffee and Donuts, 20 years of unchecked migration has worn thin on most Canadians. While the shared cultural and linguistic links with the US has allowed many Refugees to easily assimilate, many, especially in Quebec, have grown weary of the Americans, and have played into fears that the American Refugees are 'erasing' our Canadian identity. While a larger population has many benefits, especially to our thinly-spread military, there is a general feeling that the American Refugees have overstayed their welcome, leading to a prevailing increase in xenophobic rhetoric towards our Southern neighbors.

 CAN_housing_crunch_desc:0 "While Canada may be vast, only a small portion of our mighty nation is actually inhabited. The slim amount of usable land for housing, combined by a myriad of other factors such as Municipal, Provincial and Federal regulation, the presence of foreign investors, and a rapidly growing population, has made housing prices soar uncontrollably. While lucrative for the Real Estate industry, the unfriendly housing market has made it virtually impossible for average working families to afford homes. Indeed, most of our nation's young have given up any hope of home ownership, and have resorted to increasingly frugal means to keep roofs over their heads. Unless we can control our sharply rising housing prices, it seems as if the best many Canadians can hope for is living in a van down by the river."

While the Reform Party does collaborate with the PCs, their Caucus is an rowdy and often uncontrollable entity, often attracting members far outside of the reasonable Canadian political spectrum. Prime Minister Manning has done his best to alleviate this, and has had some success in attempts to form a united Conservative front; and while the Reform Party is open to this, there are still many radicals within the Reform Party who bitterly resist any attempts at reconciliation.

Despite our aces to Nuclear Secrets, Canada seems content in remaining disarmed, using our nuclear prowess for energy instead of warfare.\n\n The US Nuclear Arsenal, long fallen into disrepair, now lies split between the US Breakaways, with many silos concentrated in the Ultranationalist-controlled territories of Montana and Idaho. While we are willing to tolerate the existence of these 'nations', any sense of a nuclear-threat in the former US, especially by radical regimes, would lead to a swift and deadly Canadian response.\n\n With a large supply of former American Scientists, and access to the nuclear secrets of the old America, it is clear Canada possesses the means to make our own Arsenal; only time will tell if we can justify the ends.

However after 20 years of Nuclear neutrality, Canada has shed their policy of disarmament, and has used their nuclear prowess for both energy instead and warfare.\n\n The US Nuclear Arsenal, long fallen into disrepair, now lies split between the US Breakaways, with many silos concentrated in the Ultranationalist-controlled territories of Montana and Idaho. While we are willing to tolerate the existence of these 'nations', any sense of a nuclear-threat in the former US, especially by radical regimes, would lead to a swift and deadly Canadian response.\n\n With a large supply of former American Scientists, and access to the nuclear secrets of the old America, it is clear Canada is has both the means and the will to construct a formidable Nuclear Arsenal.

 ### FOCUSES ###

 ### Political ###
 
 CAN_prime_minister_manning:0 "Prime Minister Manning"
 CAN_prime_minister_manning_desc:0 "Putting an end to the Premiership of the NDP's Bob Rae in 2008, Preston Manning has been the first Conservative Prime Minister of Canada since Brian Mulroney, and on paper has won control of Canada’s diverse Conservative political scene. In practice however, Manning’s Rightwing Bloc is fat from unite, with cracks within his own party beginning to show. While we hope for the best, there are many within the party who fear that the events of 1989 may soon repeat under Manning’s watch..."
 CAN_harpers_folly:0 "Harper's Folly"
 CAN_harpers_folly_desc:0 "The Reform Party is a shadow of its former self, with its death knell being decisively rung when its founder left to join the PCs. While the ProgCons have been thus far content with allowing them to exist, the simple fact is that the Rightwing in Canada can not survive while divided. For the good of our ideology, we must put aside our differences with the Reformites. Prime Minister Manning shall arrange a leader with Stephen Harper, and begin the process to end the division among Canada’s Right."
 CAN_pander_to_reformites:0 "Pander to Reformites"
 CAN_pander_to_reformites_desc:0 "While the Reform Party is a thing of a past, the allignment over their former voters is far but certain. To help keep Conservative voters with the PCs, we shall begin implementing policies friendly to the Reform Party, and allow Reform Members to take prominent places in the cabinent."
 CAN_focus_on_alberta:0 "Focus on Alberta"
 CAN_focus_on_alberta_desc:0 "The results of the 2010 by-elections have revealed a grim lack of attention paid to the Prairie Provinces. Gains made by the Liberals and the NDP in Alberta have alerted us to the possibility of facing catastrophic losses in the region. With this in mind, we shall pay special attention to Alberta and the Prairie Provinces in the next Election, and appealing to blue collar and lower class voters."
 CAN_allign_fiscal_conservatives:0 "Allign Fiscal Conservatives"
 CAN_allign_fiscal_conservatives_desc:0 "While we espouse a certain brand of populism, in all practical terms our party remains more favorable to business interests than the interests of the common man. While some wish to shift our rhetoric to match that of the late Reform Party, we know that staying true to the original Progressive Conservative brand is the way forward."
 CAN_focus_on_ontario:0 "Focus on Ontario"
 CAN_focus_on_ontario_desc:0 "We can do without the votes from some hillbillies in Western Canada; but the votes we have gained from Ontario's wealthy business communities are some we simply can’t go without. Our focus of attention in the next Election shall be centered around Ontario, especially the lofty and well-connected émigrés who have settled around the Toronto area."
 CAN_rehabilitate_mulroney:0 "Rehabilitate the Free Trade Legacy"
 CAN_rehabilitate_mulroney_desc:0 "Brian Mulroney's efforts to establish a truly international Canada could not have come at a worse time. His plans to establish free and fair trade were killed on the same day America was, and in 1989, the Progressive Conservatives as a party nearly suffered the same fate. Although protectionists in our own party and Turnerite Liberals may jump at us, Mulroney's dream must return."
 CAN_2010_democratic_league_review:0 "2010 Democratic League Summit"
 CAN_2010_democratic_league_review_desc:0 "Held off-and-on every one to two years, the summits of the Democratic League provide important opportunities for members to discuss resolutions and put forward policy. This most recent summit, to be held in Sydney, is set to be one of the most energetic yet. The Democratic League is faced with a changing world; a changing world we may be able to play a much bigger part in."
 CAN_british_ties:0 "Repair our Relationship with the British"
 CAN_british_ties_desc:0 "Our relationship with Britain has been frosty ever since they refused our proposal to join the reorganized NATO. Content to sit on their isle and ignore the world, the British don't seem to pay us much mind anymore. Seeking to change this, Prime Minister [CAN.GetLeader] has sent a diplomatic mission to London, a gesture which will hopefully open up the channels with the British once more."
 CAN_our_dependencies:0 "Support our Dependencies"
 CAN_our_dependencies_desc:0 "Alaska and Greenland, on account of their barren physical habitats, are almost entirely reliant on Canada for food and vital supplies. This situation has led to them being dubbed as Canada's 'dependencies', entities which are independent in a technical sense, but are in all practical terms completely reliant on Canada. This arrangement, while beneficial, is cause for a fair amount of bitterness on their end. It is in our best interest to help alleviate this, and help Alaska and Greenland live up to their full potential."
 CAN_attack_the_liberals:0 "Red/Orange Scare"
 CAN_attack_the_liberals_desc:0 "The Liberals and the NDP have been hard at work opposing everything our government does. Despite all that the PCs have done, the opposition has found sucsess at swaying voters away from our cause. We must remind our voters of the tragic tales of the Rae and Martin governments, as a warning of what happens under when the opposition is allowed to take power. "
 CAN_play_into_anti_american_fears:0 "Play into Anti-Migrant Rhetoric"
 CAN_play_into_anti_american_fears_desc:0 "There is a certain feeling among particularly jingoistic Canadians that the countless Americans who have come to call Canada home have overstayed their welcome. While the PCs of old praised these American migrants as an industrious and hard working people, the new PCs realize that they can score some badly needed political points by rallying against them."
 CAN_manning_doctrine:0 "The [GetCanPCLeaderShortHand] Strategy"
 CAN_manning_doctrine_desc:0 "The next election is right around the corner, and party insiders have unveiled their plan to lead the PCs to decisive victory. With the Liberals and NDP mobilizing their base, it is clear that 2011 is going to be one of the most hard-fought elections in recent memory. Can the Progressive Conservatives defend their majority? Or will they meet the same fate that the Mulroney Government met in 1989?"
 
 CAN_decision_2011:0 "Decision: 2011"
 CAN_decision_2011_desc:0 "The 2011 Federal Elections have just been held, and Canadians are finished leaving the polls after electing their new representatives. As the polls close, the Canadian people chew their nails and wonder if they will have a new government come morning"
 
 CAN_pc_victory:0 "The Progressive Conservatives"
 CAN_pc_victory_desc:0 "A shocking result to some, the expected outcome to others. Regardless, the PCs have managed to maintain their hold on power. While not nearly as powerful as they were once elected, the voters of Canada have made it clear that they believe the Tories are still worthy enough to compose Canada's government."
 CAN_ndp_victory:0 "The New Democratic Party"
 CAN_ndp_victory_desc:0 "As it turns out, the Conservatives were unable to survive the tumult that plagued their Government since day 1. In their place, the New Democratic Party rises as Canada's ruling party once more. While divided between the Moderate Socialists of Jack Layton and Democratic Liberals of Bob Rae, the NDP remains a coherent entity dedicated to the progress of Canada."
 CAN_liberal_victory:0 "The Liberals"
 CAN_liberal_victory_desc:0 "In a surprising upset, the Liberals, long thought to be a spent force in Canadian Politics, have managed to outpace both the Progressive Conservatives and their ideological counterparts in the NDP. Now that it's clear that the NDP are not about to outpace the Liberals as the force representing Canada's left, the Liberals can begin implementing their agenda, and undoing the years of damage done under the PCs."
 
 CAN_prime_minister_trump:0 "Prime Minister Trump"
 CAN_prime_minister_trump_desc:0 "A wildly unexpected outcome to anyone not versed in Canadian politics, the victory of American exile Donald John Trump signals a new era for Canada, and for Democracy in the new world. While denounced as a virulent authoritarian and epitome of American privilege by some, others hold Trump up as a herald of prosperity, success and business prowess, and the perfect choice for Canada in her new era as leader of the free world."
 CAN_codify_trumpism:0 "Codify Trumpism"
 CAN_codify_trumpism_desc:0 "When Trump first announced his run for PC leadership he had little in the way of domestic or social policy, opting simply to run on a series of broad economic promises. Now that Trump has been swept into power, a concrete strategy is needed going forward."
 CAN_discourage_reformites:0 "Discourage Reformites"
 CAN_discourage_reformites_desc:0 "Harper, Cruz and their little band of Albertan Rednecks still think they can control the PCs despite being hostile to everything the party believes in. The time has come to show these radicals the door, and return restore the legacy of the PCs as true Progressive Conservatives."
 CAN_continue_ontario_partnership:0 "Continue the Ontario Partnership"
 CAN_continue_ontario_partnership_desc:0 "Ontario is Canada's shining beacon of prosperity, a gleaming center of finance and industry that is about as close to the Old New York that you can get. As a native resident of Toronto deeply entwined with the Ontario political scene, Trump has used his ties to aid him in crafting the policies of his government. While Alberta may scoff at this, we must make it clear that our focus is on finance; and finance loves Ontario."
 CAN_sweep_scandals_away:0 "Sweep Scandals Away"
 CAN_sweep_scandals_away_desc:0 "As a PM unrelentingly focused on issues of commerce, Trump seeks to keep the government close to Canada's major financiers. Of course many may denounce this as cronyism and corruption, we have to maintain the course, sweeping any scandals that may come of this under the rug."
 CAN_trump_the_businessman:0 "Trump the Businessman"
 CAN_trump_the_businessman_desc:0 "Prime Minister Trump's battle against Communism is fought not just against its totalitarian methods, but also its freedom-defying, socialistic ways. As a warrior of global capitalism since the days of the American collapse, Trump will cement his regime as one of free-market economics and classical liberal ideals."
 CAN_replace_the_fords:0 "Replace the Fords"
 CAN_replace_the_fords_desc:0 "While Trump may be from Toronto, he's not one to ignore potential bases of support just out of regional nationalism. Alberta, while more rural than the hustle and bustle of Toronto, is a wealthy region and the epicenter of Canada's oil industry. Far removed from the hubs of the Laurentian Elite which Trump belongs to, Calgary shall serve as a suitable second base of Trump's focus outside of his Toronto residences."

Trump, still veiwed with suspicion by much of the Canadian populace, has sought to reinvigorate Canadian patriotism, instilling in this meek people the value of loving their country and sheding his past asociation as an emigré. America was once the land of the free, but they're gone now. Canada is the rightful sucsessor of all that America once stood for: Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."

Canada is the hub of finance in the New World, and with the Soviet Economy badly stagnating, we may soon rise as the most powerful business center in the world.

 CAN_return_to_diefenbakerism_desc:0 "The 'Red Tory' faction within the Progressive Conservatives has been gradully whittled away ever since Manning took over the party. The reorientation of the party towards Western Canada has led to more Progressive and Disraelite members of the party being forgotten in favour of Reform Party stalwarts.

 CAN_take_on_big_buisiness_desc:0 "Many large American and Canadian businesses feel like they can simply trample the common man, and that the government will do nothing because they're too afraid to lose jobs. Former governments were, but not Jack Layton. Small Business is the heart of Canada's economy, contributing more to job creation than the conglomerates.

Despite the egregious attempts by the Mulroney and later Rae government to crush Canada's trade unions, our nation's syndicates remain strong, despite not having the prowess they once enjoyed. To restore the NDP's links with Organised Labour which had been trampled on by the Rae Government, Prime Minister Layton will remove the Mulroney and Rae-era restrictions on Canada's unions and introduce powerful anti-scab laws to ensure that bosses can't simply replace striking workforces."
 CAN_expand_social_programs:0 "Expand Social Programs"

 CAN_prime_minister_rae:0 "Rae's Second Term"
 CAN_prime_minister_rae_desc:0 "Bob Rae is a man of many contradictions; being both the leader of the New Democratic Party and a staunch opponent of many of the ideals which the party champions. His first term as Prime Minister, marred by conflict with organized labour and accusations of corruption, would ultimately not last; defeated by Manning's reinvigorated Progressive Conservatives. With Manning defeated once more, Prime Minister Rae has returned to finish the job, and ensure that the NDP, and Canada, will remain beacons of center-left Democratic thought."

 CAN_sway_the_liberals:0 "Swaying the Liberals"
 CAN_sway_the_liberals_desc:0 "Rae is by far the friendliest leader towards the Liberal Party that the NDP has ever had. Indeed, many have accused Rae of being a crypto-liberal, who's loyalty to the NDP cause only extends out of brazen opportunism. Many have gone so far as to wonder if Rae would have joined the Liberals if they had more electoral success. As political entities with much alike, we can gain much by entering an informal coalition with the Liberals."
 CAN_new_broad_front:0 "A New Broad Front"
 CAN_new_broad_front_desc:0 "Many within our party have unrealistic focuses on irrelevant feel-good issues; Rae however knows more about governing than these groups of idealistic youngsters. If we are to defeat the Progressive Conservatives, then we must look inwards, and ensure that all center-left groups in Canada are represented fairly. This supply-confidence agreement with the Liberals will also afford us some leeway if we happen to anger more socialist-leaning members of our party."
 CAN_the_merger:0 "The Merger"
 CAN_the_merger_desc:0 "In recent days and months the NDP and Liberals have grown closer than ever. While the Liberals are stubborn and prideful, they are also realistic; and the fact is that the party has had little success since the Pierre Trudeau days. The best course of action for both our parties would be a formal merger."
 CAN_prevent_backbench_revolt:0 "Prevent a Backbencher Revolt"
 CAN_prevent_backbench_revolt_desc:0 "Despite Rae's resentment, the simple fact is that the vast majority of NDP voters and representatives are on the socialist left. While Rae wishes to distance himself from this wing of the party, he has to be realistic in his strategies. For now, at least, we will have to appease our left-wing, and implement some token policies favorable to them."
 CAN_appease_layton:0 "Appease Layton"
 CAN_appease_layton_desc:0 "Jack Layton is an ever persistent figure within the realm of Canada's left, and unfortunately for Rae, a figure who often enjoys more support than he does. An always present threat is Layton pulling a 'Waffle' and starting up his own party; only this time, there is a legitimate possibility that he may take half of the NDP with him. To prevent this, we will ensure that Layton's voice is heard in the government; no matter how painful that may be for Prime Minister Rae."

 CAN_the_lesser_evil:0 "The Lesser Evil"
 CAN_the_lesser_evil_desc:0 "We find ourselves in an unprecedented age in global politics, an age where danger no longer lurks in the corner, but hides in familiar faces. The subject of how to balance our liberal democracies with the ever present need for security is a common point of contention for the Ignatieff government, who has increasingly opened up to the policy of suspending certain civil liberties in the name of protecting our country.

Far from it indeed, the reason why the Liberals were faced with such catastrophic losses is we gravitated too far from the right. There's already a party for hippies and socialists and it's called the NDP; we’re the Liberals, so let's commit to Liberalism."

 CAN_legacy_of_chretien_desc:0 "Jean Chrétien, the last Liberal Prime Minister since Ignatieff, is a polarizing figure. While beloved by many, his tenure was cut short by disagreements within his own party. While his tenure was short, it was also impactful, paving the way for some of Canada's most impactful legislation. Perhaps we should consult this veteran Liberal for advice on governing Canada?"
 CAN_social_liberal_coalition:0 "A Coalition of the Left"
 CAN_social_liberal_coalition_desc:0 "It has become clear to us that the devastating losses inflicted in recent years to the Liberals were not as a result of our party going too far left.

 CAN_no_more_scandals:0 "No More Scandals"
 CAN_no_more_scandals_desc:0 "Perhaps the most influential factor that contributed to the Liberals 20 year long slump was the fact that the party was almost constantly gripped by scandals. Exemplified during the Martin Years, these scandals gave the people of Canada the wrong image about our party, and gave our voters a carte blanche to flock to the NDP en masse. Luckily, the Ignatieff Government has done its best to clean the unsavory image of our party that has been painted throughout the years."

While some may be more concerned with results than ideals, here in Canada we have been given a unique opportunity to look inward, ask the tough questions. The time has come to finally pull the sword of political governance out of the stone of political theory. After all, politics is just as much about intention as it is about results. "

While Canada historically has had a scarce populace drawn from to fight conflicts, the terror across from our Southern Border has provided Canada with a constant stream of recruitable population for future conflicts.

With that in mind, Trudeau has announced that the wills of liberal-conservatives and pragmatists within the party will not hold him back, and that changes that could best be described as 'radical' are coming to Canada in the near future. This rapid shift, while alienating many Liberal voters, would secure any potential NDP support for the Liberal Government."

While the days of the original 'Trudeaumania' are long behind us, the younger Trudeau's allure has captured the nation once more, as the people of Canada fawn over their charismatic new leader. Like the Trudeaumania of old, this general feeling is likely to fade, but for now, Justin Trudeau can bask in leadership of a nation dazzled by his charm and good looks."

 CAN_bloc_quebecios_victory:0 "Triumph of the Bloc"
 CAN_bloc_quebecios_victory_desc:0 "The Bloc Québécois has achieved victory in the 2015 Federal Election... somehow? This shocking result has come about as a result of the BQ's unprecedented success and a complete failure of the remaining political establishment; something which has given the Bloc enough seats to form a minority government. As the dust settles, Canada's newfound ruling party must decide what their path forward will be, and what will come out of this extraordinary situation."
 CAN_quebec_issues_first:0 "Put Quebec Issues First"
 CAN_quebec_issues_first_desc:0 "The Bloc is unapologetically a party dedicated to Quebec issues, tabling issues important to Quebec exclusively.

 CAN_democratie_sociale:0 "Social-Démocratie"
 CAN_democratie_sociale_desc:0 "In addition to advocating for Quebec issues, the Bloc is also a party which holds roots in Social-Democratic and Democratic Socialist movement both within Quebec and across Canada. While the NDP has held most of Canada's Labour-Left votes, the Bloc and the NDP have differed, of course, in the fact that the BQ is a Quebec regional party. Now that we are Canada's governing party, we can help sway the left-leaning vote, and continue our advocating for a true Canadian-Québécois Social Democracy."
 CAN_le_un_terme:0 "Le Seul Terme"
 CAN_le_un_terme_desc:0 "It is obvious that the Bloc's victory in 2015 was nothing more than a freak twist of fate, and one that is not likely to be repeated any time soon.

 CAN_establish_lasting_connections:0 "Establish Lasting Connections"
 CAN_establish_lasting_connections_desc:0 "The unprecedented victory of the Bloc has telegraphed to all major parties that the will of Quebec is nothing to ignore. Now, practically every major party can not stop pandering to the Quebec vote, and has scrambled to ensure the potential loyalty of the Bloc in a minority government situation. This has untold benefits for the BQ and Quebec, as we can reliably extort the establishment for political influence."
 CAN_rethink_our_independence_positions:0 "Rethinking our Independence Position"
 CAN_rethink_our_independence_positions_desc:0 "The victory of the Bloc has invariably shattered the current paradigm of Canadian politics in regards to Quebec. The fact that the entire Canadian establishment is in a rush to pander to French-Canadians has allowed Quebec to gain untold influence within Canada, influence which has paved the foundation for a more equal Canada. Now that Anglo and Francophone Canadians are on more equal terms, many have begun to question the merits of potential Québécois independence, and our party's already unclear stance on the issue."
 CAN_bloc_rebranding:0 "Rebrand the Bloc"
 CAN_bloc_rebranding_desc:0 "The shock victory of the Bloc on a federal level has made many question the merits of the BQ as a purely regional party. Our success in 2015 has proven that we can be more than simply a party advocating for Quebec issues, and can spread out to aid all Canadians. Thus, the Bloc shall move away from its policy of Quebec regionalism, and will shift to being a major party in its own right, and run candidates outside of Quebec."

 CAN_nationwide_secularism_law:0 "Nationwide Secularism Law"
 CAN_nationwide_secularism_law_desc:0 "One notable issue pushed by the Bloc and the Québécois government is the so-called 'Secularism Law', which prohibits certain Federal employees from wearing Religious items. This focus on secularism dates back to the so-called 'Quiet Revolution', where Quebec Citizens broke from the heavily Catholic traditions of the Dupleiss Government, and instituted strictly secular policies. Now, the Bloc will expand these policies to cover all of Canada, and end the corrosive influence of theism on Federal employees."
 CAN_bloc_liberal_coalition:0 "Secure Liberal Backing"

Thus, Cruz has vanished, seemingly from the face of the earth in the moment when his party needed him most. In his place rises Jason Kenney, a former PC loyalist who defected to the Canadian Alliance after the collapse of the ProgCon poll numbers. Now rising as Prime Minister, Kenney stands behind a loose coalition with the Progressive Conservatives, who are faced with an internal crisis over the party's new direction."
 CAN_coopt_conservative_movements:0 "Co-Opt Conservative Movements"

As it seems, the CA is poised to overtake the ProgCons just as the Reform Party sought to overtake the PCs in the 90's. This time, of course, the Canadian Alliance has actually managed to edge out a win instead of eternally sitting in opposition. Some have called for a second merger, this time on our terms, while others favor the Canadian Alliance remaining as an independent right-wing force, much like the NDP is to the Liberals."

While previous governments have allowed this to occur, the Kenney Government is determined to shape Canada as a clean, moral, and outwardly Christian nation.

 CAN_laytons_sucsessor_desc_2:0 "Layton, while surviving his lengthy battle with cancer, has ultimately grown too frail to maintain leadership of a major political party. The NDP, now in a vacuum, will look within their own ranks to select a leader to follow Layton. The new generation of the NDP has risen, and while Layton's legacy is immortal, whoever the NDP selects as their new leader may have to learn that Layton's act is a difficult one to follow."

 CAN_restore_political_pragmatism_desc:0 "Jack Layton was quite the renegade in Canadian politics, paving a way for the NDP's smashing resoration as a force in Canadian politics after a decade of decline under Bob Rae. However Layton is no longer in the picture for the NDP, and while we greatly respect his legacy, the fact is that pragmatism is needed in politics now more than ever. While nothing close to Rae's policies, [CAN.GetLeader] has moved to distance the NDP from its socialist roots and instead run a moderate, 'pragmatic' campaign that includess promises to balance the budget and effectively perpetuate austerity."

 CAN_ndp_legalize_marijuana_desc:0 "After years of public policy blunders, it has become abundantly clear to almost all that the legalization of Cannabis within Canada is long overdue.

 CAN_war_on_poverty:0 "War on Poverty"
 CAN_war_on_poverty_desc:0 "The plight of the destitute in Canada is perhaps this nation's greatest unspoken crisis.

 CAN_honour_layton:0 "Honour Layton's Memory"
 CAN_honour_layton_desc:0 "Jack Layton has become one of the most beloved figures in Canadian history, surpassing his already immense popularity in life by his legacy in death.

May Layton's memory live forever, and may the NDP strive to finish in death what Layton was unable to achieve in life."
 CAN_waffle_in_power:0 "The 'Waffle' in Power"
 CAN_waffle_in_power_desc:0 "The left-wing faction of the NDP, nicknamed 'The Waffle', is now firmly in control of the party after a long period of left-wing exodus.

 CAN_canadian_democratic_socialism_desc:0 "The word 'Socialism' has finally been cleansed of its Soviet connotations, now being seen as a natural goal of the NDP instead of a forbidden concept within the party.

 CAN_anti_american_nationalism:0 "Anti-American Nationalism"
 CAN_anti_american_nationalism_desc:0 "The United States' downfall was the culmination of decades of failed imperialism and internal decay, exemplified by the hypercapitalist policies of the Reagan and Ashbrook administrations.

While we were content with our place, everything would change following the collapse of the United States in 1987. America's fall shook the roots of our foreign and domestic policy to its core; and as the remains of what was once America convulsed, a near-endless stream of desperate Americans heading towards Canada's borders. And if things couldn't get worse, the rest of our NATO allies either refused the call to protect Global Democracy, or themselves fell to the ravenous Communists.\n\n 20 years later, Canada is left as one of the world's last democracies, stranded along with the other shards of freedom in this Red World. Heralding what's left of NATO, Canada fights a seemingly hopeless fight against Soviet Hegemony; determined above all to avenge their fallen brothers to the South and restore freedom's bright gleam to a world darkened by Communism."

The ProgCons today are the main force representing Canada's right, however this was not always the case. During the 1990s it seemed apparent that the Progressive Conservatives were doomed, condemned to irrelevance by their Western Canada oriented opposition in the Reform Party. While they managed to fend off irrelevance by cooperating with the Liberals, the Reform Party consistently managed to outshine the PCs in every area. However this trajectory would not remain, as the PCs would find themselves rebounding in the mid 2000s. In the wake of the PC resurgence, and the growing calls for a united Canadian Conservative Party in the form of the 'Unite the Right' movement, Preston Manning, once a staunch opponent of the PCs, agreed to dissolve the Reform Party and endure the ProgCons.\n\n This decision however was not universal, as vast swaths of the Reform Party continued to act as an independent entity, and found a new leader in the form of Stephen Harper, who denounced both Manning and his populist direction. While the Reform Party is broadly cooperative towards the Progressive Conservatives, their increasing bend towards defiance has many PC insiders worried. With Manning now Prime Minister, there are many who guess that a formal merger between the two parties may soon be in order. All that's needed to get things in motion is a catalyst..."

The obvious place to set up shop was Canada's, a nation in close proximity which possessed relative isolation from Communist threats. Additionally, Canada shared much of the same linguistic and cultural infrastructure of the old United States, allowing the 'emigrés' to adapt quickly to their new lives in Canada. 20 years later, Canada's economy has flourished, allowing Canada to establish itself as the unquestioned center of Global Commerce. With the Soviets stagnating and the Chinese struggling to break into international markets, Canada can safely boast about having the world's strongest economy. While there have undoubtedly been downsides to this arrangement with American Business, namely appalling corruption, Canada can thrive as an international hub of prosperity and economic safety. From Vancouver to Montreal, from Halifax to Calgary, Canada's business is business."

 rw_canada.4.d:0 "Prominent Businessman and former member of the Toronto City Council, Donald Trump has officially tendered his resignation from the Senate of Canada. An influential figure within the Canadian political scene, Trump has thus far been content managing his many enterprises and quietly supporting the Progressive Conservatives. Despite being a personal friend of Pierre Trudeau near the end of his life, Trump has remained a strong supporter of the Progressive Conservatives; often providing them with generous donations of campaign funds. After a brief stint on the Toronto City Council, and a failed run for Mayor of Toronto in 2000, Trump has sought to remain quiet in the realm of politics, and since has only accepted a nomination to the generally apolitical Canadian Senate.\n\n Trump's appointment caused a small controversy, as some accused the PCs of appointing Trump due to his lofty contributions to the Conservative campaign; while Prime Minister Manning maintained that Trump was appointed due to his business expertise, and as a reward for his decades of service to the Canadian Economy. The resignation of Senator Trump to many is a sign that Trump is back at it again, and is moving to become more involved in the Canadian political scene. Prominent whispers surrounding Trump have pointed to a possible Parliamentary run, most likely as a shoo-in in the district of Etobicoke Centre, one of the few PC seats in the Greater Toronto Area. "

The Reform Party, while on paper an independent political entity, is heavily aligned with the PCs and are known to collaborate with them on several hot-button legislative issues. This de-facto coalition is a particularly contentious issue for Cruz, who has denounced both the PCs and any attempts by the Reform Party to work with them. According to Cruz, the Progressive Conservatives have sold out the core tenets of Conservatism, and have increasingly given way to psuedo-Socialist and proto-Liberal politics, and are no longer reliable as a right-wing party. Additionally, Cruz has rejected the concept of 'Strategic Voting', stating that a NDP or Liberal Victory would be preferable to a PC one because the Liberals and NDP are at least 'Honest about their intentions'.\n\n This increasing pattern of Reform disloyalty is a large contributing factor to the increasingly grim forecast for our next by-elections, as Reform candidates often attack Conservatives more than they attack their left-wing opponents."

Ever since, relations between Harper and Manning have been strained, with Harper often lending confidence to the PC Government in exchange for certain political concessions. However, this situation seems to be gearing up for a change, as Manning and Harper have begun moving to formally end the PC-Reform divide, and bring the mutinous faction back into the PC fold.

Leaders from both parties have emphasized the need for unity to present a robust challenge to the Liberals and the NDP, acknowledging that a fragmented conservative front has diminished their collective impact in recent elections. This strategic fusion, while widely supported by those advocating for a stronger opposition, has also stirred debate among party members concerned about preserving their distinct ideologies and policies.

This union, aimed at consolidating conservative forces within Canadian politics, has sparked intense debate across the political spectrum. Cruz, known for his staunch advocacy for core Reform Party principles, views this merger as a dilution of the party's foundational values. He articulates his concerns with a fervor that resonates with many party loyalists, arguing that the merger compromises the distinct identity and ideological purity that the Reform Party has long championed. His denunciation is not just a critique of the merger but an impassioned plea for the preservation of the party's unique political legacy.\n\n In public forums and the halls of Parliament, Cruz has been forthright in expressing his disapproval, warning that this blending of parties risks alienating the grassroots supporters who have been the backbone of the Reform Party's strength. He contends that the merger represents a capitulation to political expediency over principle, a move that could erode the trust and support of the party's base. Despite facing opposition from those in favor of the merger, Cruz's stance has struck a chord with a significant faction within the party, igniting a robust internal debate about the future direction of conservative politics in Canada. His position underscores a deep-seated tension within the party, reflecting the broader challenges of balancing ideological integrity with the pragmatic demands of political unification."

This party, named the 'Canadian Alliance', is dedicated to Conservatism in both an economic and social sense, and has promised to undo the decades of Social Reform advanced under the Rae and Chrétien Governments. This party has been described as 'Fascistic' by some, and is without a doubt the most radical player on the organized Canadian political scene.

A fierce and uncompromising figure, Poilievre has already made his fair share of enemies through a series of gutsy attacks and public stunts, all aimed at riling up the PC base. Most notably, Poilievre has become a frequent critic of the way Canada conducts elections, and has proposed several changes to the way Canadians vote; mainly the elimination of the vouching system. The proposed addendums garnered opposition across both Canada and the world's remaining democracies, leading Poilievre to attack the chief electoral office of Elections Canada, stating that they want 'more power, a bigger budget and less accountability'.\n\n Poilievre, while strengthening the PC's image as a party not afraid to fight the good fight, has also garnered a significant amount of criticism for his more 'questionable' comments.

Seeing the PCs through to their worst result in History, Mulroney had to bear the sting of losing his own seat, an unprecedented occurrence in Canadian politics. Despite this, the Manning Government has moved to rehabilitate his legacy; putting forward many of the shelved policies of the Mulroney Government which were proposed yet never implemented. Mulroney's dream of Canadian Trade Prowess, long overshadowed by humiliating failures of the Meech Lake Accord and later 1989 Federal Election, has become a hallmark of the modern ProgCon movement, who have moved to open up trade with our shattered Southern neighbors. While we share little in common ideologically with most of the US remnants, we can not deny the potential benefits of establishing business relations with the American breakaways. Mulroney himself has been delighted by this new direction for the PCs, and has offered his full-throated support to Prime Minister Manning; even if he encouraged Manning to move towards more moderate Conservative stances in the same breath. Indeed, it seems that Mulroney has lived to see more of his policies implemented in retirement than he did while he was Prime Minister. "

According to Trump, the opening of Canada's markets to foreign goods threatens the Canadian economy and puts Canada's already fragile job market at risk. Trump has instead come out strongly in favour of protectionist policies which would defend domestic business against foreign competition with a system of high tariffs.\n\n This vocal attack has once more put Donald Trump in the spotlight. Trump himself, while quite comfortable in the PC caucus, has been more and more vocal about his distrust of Manning's new direction and association with the Reform Party. Indeed, Trump has frequently attacked the Reform Party's on many issues, particularly Stephen Harper's approach to Social Conservatism. Trump fancies himself as something of an Economic Conservative with Liberal social attitudes, a stance which has not sat well with much of PC's new Prairie-based electorate.

On the Provincial level, the Fords are the main Conservative opposition to Liberal Premier Dalton McGuinty, as well as on the Municipal level, where Liberals such as Joe Pantalone and David Miller still hold influence over Toronto Politics.

This course will hopefully allow both 'New NDPers' and 'Waffleites' to find comfort within the NDP, and allow the party to flourish as a big-tent movement which can accommodate a wide variety of voters.

 rw_canada.60.d:0 "During the late 60's and early 70's a faction of the NDP colloquially known as 'The Waffle' sprung up, pushing for the NDP and their moderate drift in the wake of the Winnipeg Convention and fully commit the party to Democratic Socialist causes. Composed mainly of mostly young, university students and intellectuals, the 'Waffle' received their famed nickname by future Prime Minister Ed Broadbent, who said that if they had to choose between waffling to the left and waffling to the right, they waffle to the left'. Led by Mel Watkins and James Laxer, this faction within the NDP attempted in vain to change the face of the party on their terms, however after Waffle candidate James Laxer was defeated by David Lewis, many New-Left loyalists quit the NDP to found their own political movement. The 'Movement for an Independent Socialist Canada' was founded by Laxer and Watkins, and attempted unsuccessfully to run candidates on the Federal Level. By the late 80's many of the Waffle's leaders had returned to the NDP, taking up important positions and shaping the policy of the party in the late 20th century. The second 'Waffle Exodus' occurred after Bob Rae gained control of the NDP. Rae's policies in regards to Unions and the NDP left came under heavy scrutiny by Waffleites, who either stood behind Layton's backbench revolt, or resigned from the party altogether. With Rae firmly out of the picture, Layton has formally made amends with the former leaders of the Waffle: James Laxer and Mel Watkins. Layton's courting of these two figures is seen by many as a sign that the NDP is going beyond the Broadbent-era Social Democracy, and returning to their roots as a Democratic Socialist party. While this may cost the NDP the support of certain 'Establishment' voters, the NDP has always stood steadfast in their determination to break the Canadian political establishment; not become it."

To keep our precious health system intact and out of the hands of profiteers, Prime Minister Layton has announced that the Provincial-Federal healthcare divide shall be restored to the 1984 status quo, where the Provinces and the Federal Government would share equal responsibilities in matters of health. Additionally, we shall prohibit private firms from operating in essential areas, and expand Medicare to cover essential treatments such as vision and dental care.

The rates of workplaces in Canada which fell under the umbrella of a Trade Union have slumped rapidly ever since. This has meant that workers have gone without representation and are thus alone against cruel bosses and unsafe working conditions. The NDP, once the official political arm of the Canadian Labour Congress, has begun working to fix this glaring issue, and have been hard at work tearing down the vestiges of our remaining anti-union legislation, as well as drafting our very own anti-scab legislation to ensure that Canada's workers can safely go on strike without fear of losing their jobs.\n\n While some have denounced this as a gateway to Canada's very own Bolshevik Revolution, the NDP says that a fairly represented worker is the best way to keep Labour conflicts from turning violent.

This is not to say that they aren't an influential force in their own right, however they are a force that we in the NDP can clearly live without. Their refusal to work together with Layton to take down the Rae government when they had the chance has not been forgotten, and shows just what side they are on. Just like Rae the Liberals play to the beat of Capital's drum, and would gleefully sell out Canada's workers whenever Big Business issues a marching-order.

During 2005, Bob Rae mainly focused on the Progressive Conservatives as the main source of their attacks, leaving the Liberals well enough alone. This decision was both a pragmatic one and a strategic one, as while the Liberals poll numbers were in freefall in the wake of the Sponsorship Scandal, Rae had also attempted to court strategic Liberal supporters in an attempt to absorb the remains of a seemingly dying party. With Martin's defeat assured, Rae's political crusade focused on the resurgent PCs, and shockingly enough, 'Socialist' members of his own party. Now in [GetYear], Layton has begun implementing a similar strategy, albeit one free from the vicious cross-NDP attacks that was a hallmark of the Rae era. Previously denouncing the Liberal Party as corrupt and out-of-touch, Layton has scaled back his campaign to mainly focus on the Progressive Conservatives and Canadian Alliance, recognizing them as a greater threat.

This meeting, emblematic of the party's gradual drift towards more center-right policies, marks a pivotal moment in its ideological trajectory. Michael Ignatieff, a figure who has been at the forefront of this subtle yet discernible shift, engaged in extensive discussions with Martin, whose tenure as Prime Minister was characterized by fiscally conservative policies that left an indelible mark on the party's economic approach. This rendezvous between past and present leadership is seen as a confluence of ideas aimed at redefining the Liberal Party’s stance, particularly in areas of economic management and social policy.\n\n The convergence of Ignatieff's contemporary vision with Martin's legacy is indicative of the party's adaptation to the changing political landscape of Canada. Under Ignatieff's guidance, the Liberals are increasingly embracing policies that lean towards fiscal prudence, balanced budgets, and market-friendly strategies, a departure from their traditionally more centrist, if not center-left, positioning. This ideological realignment, while drawing some criticism from the party's traditional base, is also seen as a strategic move to capture a broader electorate, particularly in the face of rising challenges from both the left and the right of the political spectrum.

While the NDP has stated that Rae's leaving was a mutual decision, in secret the defection of Rae was years in the making, with a common remark within the NDP being that Rae would have joined the Liberals long ago if their poll numbers were better. Rae's break with the NDP was made inevitable after Michael Ignatieff (Rae's former College Roommate) became Prime Minister; putting the Liberals back in the spotlight and firmly establishing the Liberals once more as the unquestioned force of Canada's center-left."

The Party under Ignatieff now seeks to remedy this, and give those on Canada's right a moderate alternative to the Progressive Conservatives. The Progressive Conservatives, while claiming to be a moderate party, have been rotted from the inside by radical Reform Party Loyalists, and are now nothing but a gaggle of ill-educated reactionaries. The Liberals, long scorned by Canada's right, will now embrace a steady form of Liberal Conservatism, which can hopefully allow them to appeal to both Left-Wing and Right-Wing voters.\n\n Of course, this direction is heavily frowned upon by Social Liberals within the party, who have been engaged in a backbench revolt as a result. Manning this revolt is Justin Trudeau, son of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, who has denounced Ignatieff's direction as betraying the Liberal brand and opening up the party to reactionary infiltration, damning the Liberals to the same fate which befell the PCs.

 rw_canada.94.d:0 "In a politically charged and symbolic meeting, Prime Minister Jean Chrétien sat down with his successor, Michael Ignatieff, in a gathering that has been widely interpreted as a nod towards the Canadian Liberal Party's shift to the left. This rendezvous, bringing together two pivotal figures of Canadian politics, underscores a significant ideological recalibration within the party. Chrétien, known for his charismatic leadership and centrist policies, engaged in profound discussions with Ignatieff, who himself had navigated the complexities of economic and social reforms during his tenure. This meeting represents a confluence of ideas, symbolizing the party's increasing inclination towards progressive policies and social welfare agendas.\n\nThe convergence of Chrétien's complicated legacy with Ignatieff's insights reflects the Liberal Party's response to the evolving demands of Canadian society. Under Chrétien's influence, the Liberals appear to be embracing a more socially conscious approach, prioritizing healthcare, environmental stewardship, and inclusive social policies. This shift is seen as an attempt to realign the party with the needs and aspirations of a broader demographic, particularly younger voters and those concerned with social justice issues. The engagement between these two leaders, with their rich history in the party's evolution, is emblematic of the Liberals' commitment to progressive values. This move, while potentially alienating some of the party's more fiscally conservative supporters, is a strategic effort to reestablish the Liberals as a champion of left-leaning ideals, reflecting a renewed focus on addressing the challenges of inequality and climate change in the contemporary Canadian political landscape."

This strategy has had some success, with many Rae supporters coming to the aid of the Liberals after becoming alienated with the NDP's leftward direction.\n\n This new direction of the party has had broad support within the higher echelons of the party, as many feel that the collapse of the party in the early 2000s was a result of the party's abandonment of their left-wing founding principles. Of course, there are still business oriented minds, mostly coalesced around former Prime Minister Paul Martin, who view this new direction as dangerous and liable to alienate those who seek an alternative to the Tories.

Indeed, it seemed that few were willing to risk the integrity of the Canadian nation in the wake of the collapse of the United States. While the broad concept of 'Sovereignty' has been a popular proposition, 'Independence' has remained a dirty word in Canadian politics ever since 1995. The attachment to pro-independence ideals starkly divided the Bloc Québécois, and led to an almost 20-year slump in party popularity which we are only now recovering from. The fact that the BQ managed to win a majority of Quebec seats appeared to be as a result of the BQ's increasingly unclear stance on Quebec independence, with a broad shift occurring from 'Independence' to 'Autonomy'(even if particularly determined figures still push for Independence from the rest of Canada). Of course, since the BQ now has a powerful amount of sway in Canadian politics, the party has sought to ditch any such affiliations with independence movements and instead focus on using the Bloc's leverage as a bargaining chip to help the rest of the political establishment focus on Quebec issues."

This new direction would give the BQ more breathing room in federal affairs, and potentially give them enough leeway to govern without NDP or Liberal backing. Of course, while the idea of a BQ majority government is beyond reasonable consideration, running more candidates could do enough to pad the predicted losses for the BQ, and allow the margin of error for Bloc seats to extend beyond a few seats."

With this new tonal shift, the Bloc has announced their intention to run candidates across Canada. This new attempt by the Bloc to break into the Anglophone political scene has mixed reactions. Most Canadians find the idea of the Bloc running candidates in English Canada as laughable, and analysts are skeptical about the Bloc's ability to win even a single seat outside of Quebec. Despite this, there is still a large voting base for this new 'Canadian Bloc' across the country, as a great deal of non-Francophone Canadians have commended the BQ's job at governing Canada. As well, many Francophone communities outside of Quebec have welcomed a new nationwide force representing them, as the Bloc has paid special attention to these areas in hopes to leverage their French-Canadian identity."

You saw what Reagan did? He took a big beautiful country and he wrecked it, he wrecked it quite frankly. And Bush!

When I arrived in Canada, I said 'Hey look, these Reform Party people, they were just like Reagan!'. Reagan , who was a very incompetent person, who was the person who ruined the USA. And those Reform people were all very angry and didn't like Toronto, and I think that's not a very good brand for a party'.\n\n Furthermore, Trump would state that 'I loved the United States, it was a magnificent land of freedom and prosperity, but that's all gone now. When I ran for Prime Minister for Canada, I didn't want to make Canada America, because Canada was already America quite frankly, what I wanted to do was let Canada reach their full potential as a wonderful bastion of prosperity.

Hope for Canada's working men and women rebounded during Ed Broadbent's first term, as the CLC-aligned NDP was finally given a shot at power after decades of Conservative and Liberal Dominance. Even if the damage done by the Mulroney government was not fully undone, Broadbent's social-democratic government worked tirelessly to give Canada's unions a second shot. Throughout losses in the later 90's, the NDP remained the bulward of organized labour's representation in Canadian politics. However, that all changed during the tenure of Bob Rae. Rae, out of either greed or a desire to appease right-leaning members of the Canadian establishment so happily threw away countless years of solidarity between the NDP and the CLC, and in the process doomed his own Premiership. Now that Layton and union-friendly leadership has regained control of the party, the NDP is now once more the party of the working man.

While the Liberals would eventually regain their hold on the left-leaning establishment, Broadbent's victory permanently solidified the NDP as a serious player in the Canadian political arena. Even after leaving power, Ed Broadbent has always been a firebrand and staunch supporter of 'Classical' NDP politics. This stance, while popular to much of the party's base, made him many enemies during the tenure of Bob Rae, where he, along with Jack Layton, led a backbench revolt against the 'New NDP', forcing Rae to compromise with the Liberal party to remain in power.

While delibratley avoiding the Rae-era 'Third Wayist' rhetoric, Rae has worked closely with former Prime Minister Ed Broadbent to rebrand the NDP as a traditional Social Democratic party. While this move has angered many 'Waffleites', and has failed to bring back former NDP loyalists such as Hargrove, this move has been applauded by both moderates and left-wingers. Indeed, much of the 'Waffle' base has begrudgingly accepted this trend, and have accepted that the days of the NDP being openly socialist are long gone.

This support from the American exile communist has persisted despite Trump's vocal attacks against immigrants from the Commonwealth and UAPR; this of course being doubly ironic considering Trump’s American heritage.

Also common within the psyche of Trump supporters is a prevailing feeling of nostalgia; one of harkening back to the 'Good old Days'; before the collapse of the United States. These nostalgics wish to return to a 'Simpler' time, a time before the triumph of Communism worldwide and before the grips of political and social rot consumed the United States, and see Trump as just the man to make that happen. While these movements have an undeniable evangelical bend, the failure of Christian politics to take root in Canada has greatly dampened their ability to spread their ideals in such a fashion. Additionally, the most extreme 'Followers of the Red Hat' believe that Trump is something of a modern messiah figure, with several conspiracy theories revolving around him being spread by the Radio and Intranet. These conspiracies have managed to permeate the National Zeitgeist, and while they hold little credibility, their influence of lower-middle-class and emigré Canadians can not be denied. "

 rw_canada.147.d:0 "At one point Rafael Edward 'Ralph' Cruz was among Donald Trump's most dedicated opponents. The rift between Trump and Cruz was in many ways a reflection of the rift in Canadian right-wing politics; a clash of movements and personalities represented in the divide between the Toronto 'Red Tory' Trump and the hard right Alberta Reformite Cruz. That is why Cruz's recent announcement comes as such a shock. Amid Trump's radical reorganization towards right-leaning Reformite politics, much of the previously rebellious Canadian Alliance has won over Trump's support. This comes amid unprecedented discontent within the ProgCon 'Red Tory' wing which was previously loyal to Trump. This backbench revolt, manned by former Deputy Prime Minister Andrew Scheer, has crippled the Trump Cabinet's ability to conduct business, and has given the Canadian Alliance a crucial amount of leeway. However instead of simply bringing the CA into a supply-confidence agreement with the PCs, Trump has instead moved to absorb the party entirely; with Cruz remarking that the Progressive Conservatives have moved to 'Exemplify the spirit of the Reform Party' under Trump. This hard-right shift by the Trump Cabinet is just one in a series of erratic moves by Trump's government, and has led to many left-of-centre and centrist PCs to question their future within the Party."

The Reform Party and the Progressive Conservatives, at one point both separate and competing right-wing movements, united as one to wield their influence more effectively. This act, while strengthening their ideals on the Canadian political scene, has led to a deeply divided Progressive Conservative Caucus ready to implode at any time. In an effort to avoid angering any side of the party, Prime Minister [CAN.GetLeader] has sought to implement politically neutral policies. This effort to avoid provoking either party wing has meant that the Prime Minister must walk on eggshells in regards to many policies.

While the issue of international trade, particularly the 'Free Trade' focus embarked upon by Prime Minister Mulroney is a much more controversial matter, especially within the Reformite wing of the party, the elimination of inter-Province commerce barriers is a non controversial and mutually agreeable issue within the party.

This triumph of the Reform Party, while remarked as quite ironic due to the shared histories of both parties, is scoffed at by ProgCon loyalists who see the rise of the Reform faction as a betrayal of so many years of loyalty. Former PC Prime Minister Joe Clark has said on the issue that 'The modern Progressive Conservative Party is simply the Reform Party wearing our party's skin after killing them'.

The failure to appeal to voters in Quebec and Ontario was the primary driving force behind the Reform Party's collapse, and only led to further political undercutting in Western Canada. Now that Reform and the PCs are one, there is little to be gained in Western Canada, as the region is already a solid vote bloc for the Conservatives. With this in mind, the PCs have begun a new campaign to win votes in regions which historically have been tepid to the Reform Party's brand of populism.

To achieve this, the Canadian Government has invested heavily in new cutting-edge gear, weaponry and military advisors for the new armies of Montana and Idaho. However this plan has fallen short in many areas, as much of the know-how on how to operate this equipment is known only to Canadian advisors, and not the Americans themselves. This unfortunate reliance on Canada has many worried that the armies of the Northwest may not be able to stand on their own two feet once the Canadians leave; others have dismissed these fears as hyperbole, and have promised continued support until such a time as the Northwest can achieve full military self-reliance.\n\n Regardless, there are still those in our General Staff who propose more significant investments in upkeep, and a broader focus on concrete strategy, something which would be more sustainable for rustic and isolated area.

This has led to much of our military establishment favoring a policy of 'collaboration' with the Militias, simply bribing them to stay out of our business and shifting the burden on to the local population. This has allowed a powerful underground to emerge in the Pacific Northwest, with former Neo-Nazi leaders turning to illegal means such as narcotics, moonshine and banned weaponry to fund their lifestyle. This market, while in close proximity to the Canadian border, has not spread to Canada due to a mutual understanding with ringleaders. This practical alliance between the Canadian government and the Northwest Black Market, while successfully managing to stem the flow of illegal goods into Canada, has also cost the Canadian government both untold funds and a significant amount of credibility with the restored governments of Montana and Idaho, who warn that this Black Market may become an uncontrollable force once the Canadian garrison departs."

While our policy on dealing with these stragglers is anything but consistent, our policy in advising the Montanan/Idahoan governments on the matter has remained rather consistent. This response focuses on a strong Central Government which can quickly effectively respond to threats, focusing on the utilization of command centers and urban infrastructure. This strategy, while not without its merits, has drawn criticism for neglecting the Northwest's rural terrain and reclusive population.

Fears of a potential return to the Covington-era have been allayed, as the remaining Neo-Nazi militias scattered in the countryside have failed to gain any ground. The few powerful resistance cells left over by the Covington government have either collapsed due to infighting or have surrendered to the Montanan Army, and the final dedicated supporters of Richard Spencer's insane philosophy have either retreated in to the isolated woods to wither away, or have followed Spencer into his exile (and practical house-arrest) in the Soviet Union.\n\n While we can never know what the future will hold, it seems that the prospects for the new Republics of Montana and Idaho are bright."

Timothy McVeigh has been proclaimed the new Commander of the Montanan Nation, which has been reorganized on similar lines to the original Montanan Neo-Nazi Regime of Harold Covington. Meanwhile, in Idaho, Richard Spencer has returned from his exile in the Soviet Union with his diminished contingent of loyalists. Spencer, while managing to reassert control over his American Statelet, has had his position significantly weakened in comparison to the heydays of the Lincoln movement.

However as one enemy falls, a new one arises, as the German Democratic Republic, better known as the DDR, has taken up leadership of the Warsaw Pact in the USSR's absence. Long thought to be the Soviet Union's natural successor, Germany's status as our main threat on the world stage certainly brings back memories for many Canadians. Of course, Canada faces our new foe with neither fear nor fatigue; we bested the Krauts at Vimy Ridge, we bested them at D-Day, and with God as our witness we shall beat them again.

This election would see the loss of the NDP to the resurgent Liberal Party under Jean Chrétien, with minor backing by the remnants of the Progressive Conservatives and Bloc Quebecois. Held against the backdrop of the disastrous 1995 Quebec Independence referendum, this election would mark the end of the so-called 'Broadbent' era, and would herald the Liberal's return as a serious contender in the Canadian Political arena. Despite this, the losing NDP under lame-duck Prime Minister Audrey McLaughlin would still go on to hold more seats than both the Liberals and PCs combined. Jean Chrétien, while viewed favorably by the Canadian Electorate, would still be considered a failure by much of the Canadian political arena due to constant squabbling between the disparate PC/Liberal/Bloc coalition."

After new details of the sponsorship scandal emerged via the Gomery Commission, the PCs ended their coalition with the Liberals and united with the three opposition parties to bring down Liberal Prime Minister Paul Martin's minority government, triggering an unusual winter election. This election would see catastrophic losses by both the Liberals and the Reform Party, and would once more see the Liberal Party reduced to a third party player in Canadian politics. While the NDP would go on to soundly win the 2004 elections, the Progressive Conservatives would also see a shocking resurgence, becoming the official opposition under Prime Minister Bob Rae. The success of the PCs was widely attributed to the prevalence of the 'Unite the Right' movement, and subsequent dissolution of Reform by Preston Manning and endorsement of the PCs. While the Reform Party would continue its presence in the Canadian political scene, the 'betrayal' of their founder did irreparable damage to the Reform Party's prestige on the national stage, and would set the stage for Manning's later election as leader of the Progressive Conservatives.

This election would see the defeat of Bob Rae's incumbent NDP government and the rise of a Progressive Conservative government for the first time since the Mulroney era. Rae's government would be defined by a devastating backbencher revolt by 'Progressive' NDP members. This caucus revolt, started by Jack Layton and supported by former Prime Minister Ed Broadbent, was caused by Rae's support of controversial legislation deemed to be anti-union. The fallout of this conflict would lead to much of the NDP's union base either abandoning the party, or keeping their support for the party quiet. The refusal to cooperate by much of the party would see the NDP rely on the rump Liberal party to avoid a no-confidence vote against Rae, and permanently divide the NDP based on ideological lines. While the NDP avoided falling apart, Jack Layton announced his intention to challenge Rae for NDP leadership for the second time since 2003, where he was defeated by Bob Rae in part due to Rae's fear mongering about Layton’s supposed associations with Socialists.

Known to locals as the 'Silent War', this military conflict was notable for its complete lack of casualties, and its sucsess in its objectives to secure the Danish territory of Greenland. In the aftermath of this operation, the remains of the Kingdom of Denmark were reorganized into the 'Kingdom of Greenland', a nation which preserved both the former Danish government and Greenland's current status within the Danish Realm. The mixed Greenlandic-Danish government, while legally the successor to the former Kingdom of Denmark, was seen by many as simply an independent Greenlandic nation. Any such claims to the Danish homeland was abandoned by Queen Margrethe II, who fully embraced Greenland's new role as a nation independent from Denmark. While this event would lead to Greenland's official independence, in many ways Greenland would remain as a subject, as Canada increasingly took on Denmark's former role as overlords of Greenland."

While the Bush Government in the South attempted to exert their control of the Canal, their lack of spare manpower led to the Panamanian government immediately moving to seize control of the Canal. This action was opposed by the remaining Canal Garrison, which managed to fend off Panama's advances until outside support arrived. Aided by the United Kingdom and Canada, the Canal Zone Garrison managed to keep the Panamanians from seizing control of the Canal, and would eventually lead to Canada taking up the former United States' guardianship of the Canal. This event has been a permanent source of contention between the Canadian and Panamanian governments, and has ultimately damaged the ability of Canada to exert their influence in Central America."

The culmination of multiple years of debate and planning after the failure of the Meech Lake and Charlottetown constitutional accords, the referendum was launched by the provincial Parti Québécois government of Jacques Parizeau This referendum would turn out to be a resounding failure, with an estimated 79% of Quebec's population outright rejecting the possibility of secession. The defeat of the 'Yes' campaign was seen as a combination of poor planning and a distrust of separatist movements developing after the collapse of the United States. The chaos that followed the USA's 'Peaceful' dissolution put a damper on those who wanted to see such separations occur up North, and contributed to a feeling both in Anglophone and Francophone Canada that the nation must stay together at all cost. These feelings, combined with a sense of Canada's newfound status as 'Leader of the Free World', put an end to talks of Quebecois separation, and lead to the Bloc Quebecois' eventual collapse as a major force in Federal Politics."

The unidentified flying still remains a mystery to the government, despite extensive scrutiny by both the public and the Military. Neither CANADC nor the RCAF was able to detect the object, and neither agency, nor the Canada Command had any information on the objects.

 can_flavour.3.d:0 "Hockey: Canada's national pastime. A time-honored tradition that has graced the Telescreens of Canadians and Americans alike for countless decades. A rivalry born in blood and brews, Hockey night in Canada used to be the day where Canadians bite their nails and wonder if the Stanley Cup is coming home, or going to the States'. Of course, ever since the fall of the United States Canada has held a practical monopoly on the cup, with a Canadian team winning every cup since 1983, and an American team last coming to the final round in 2002. That has changed this year as the Arizona Coyotes have come to challenge the Ottawa Senators in 2010's Stanley Cup final. The Cyotes, who themselves defeated the Minnesota Wild, are the only hockey team in the Republic of Arizona, a nation which still continues participation in the NHL unlike the Commonwealth and the People's Republic.\n\n As the puck drops, countless Americans and Canadians hold their breath. Will Canada keep their unchallenged title? Or will an American take the cup for the first time in 20 years?"

As they arrived in Phoenix, they were greeted by Arizonan President [ARI.GetLeader], who congratulated the team for their victory. The result is not so warmly felt in Canada, who has lambasted their loss to a nation which doesn't even have natural snow."

Regardless of their loss, their status at the verge of greatness has greatly reignited passion for Hockey across the border, and has proven that the Cup is not out of reach for an American team.

A beloved source of chit-chat over water coolers and source of pride for Canadians, who can boast about their unchallenged prowess in the sport. Indeed, Canada has held the title of Stanley Cup Champions for the better part of thirty years, with even some of our crappier teams such as the Ottawa Senators and Toronto Maple Leafs taking the cup once every few years. Despite this, Vancouver's own 'Vancouver Canucks' have once more failed to bring home the Stanley Cup, losing by two points during the 7th game of the Stanley Cup finals to the Nashville Predators. This teeth-clenched defeat for Vancouver has been the cause for dismay among the populace, and as has become common with feelings of great pain in sporting communities, the good hooligans of Vancouver have turned to violence as means to express their feelings. A routous night of rioting and vandalism has taken the city by storm. Starting first with hurled beer bottles and Predators jerseys set alight, the illegal activities have expanded to include overturned vehicles, occupied public spaces, vandalism and looting. By midnight, the rioters were dispersed by the Vancouver Police with the aid of smoke bombs and helicopters, with travel advisories across the city warning citizens not to venture downtown until the situation has stabilized. Initial reports indicate that almost 150 people have been injured during the incident, including four stabbings. Overall, nearly 100 arrests have been made by the VPD and almost $4 million in damage inflicted. This incident has gone down in history as an embarrassing chapter in both the history of the Canadian nation, and the sport of Hockey itself."

From 100$ Bills to 'Loonies' and 'Toonies', Canadians know their denominations of physical currency well; however, today, the Government has announced a drastic altering of the once familiar family of Canadian pocket change. The new Federal budget is set to leave Canadians penniless — literally. Indeed, among the victims of cutbacks outlined by the Finance Minister is Canada's one-cent coin. Citing low purchasing power and rising production costs, the government has decided to phase the penny out of existence starting this fall, when the Royal Canadian Mint will stop distributing the one-cent coin to financial institutions. While the government noted on Thursday that one-cent coins will always be accepted in cash transactions for as long as people still hold on to them, it is expected that soon the penny will effectively become extinct. The value of the penny has decreased to about 1/20th of its original purchasing power. In part because of rising prices for the metals it's made of, the costs to produce the penny exceed its spending power. With the penny being eliminated from cash transactions, prices will be rounded up or down to the nearest five-cent increment.\n\n While some have mourned the loss of their beloved little coins, the Federal government has hailed this action as one that will save both the taxpayers, and the Royal Canadian Mint millions of dollars."

Starting with the first Soviet ventures in space and later American Moon Landings, at first the 'Space Race' was seen as nothing more than a pissing contest betweens the Americans and the Soviet Union, however in the decades since, humans have come together as one in their pursuit of exploring of the great unknown above. Unfortunately, since the fall of NASA, the realm of space exploration has remained fairly ignored, sidelined in favor of more important budgetary concerns. Additionally, among the few nations in possession of viable Space Agencies, many currently lie under the yoke of Communist Regimes not on the friendliest terms with the rest of the world. Despite this, advancements in the area of space travel continue to be made, with the primary example of this new ‘Space Race’ being the newly christened 'Global Space Center', which launched earlier this year. A joint venture maintained by several different Space Agencies, including the JAASET (the Joint American Air and Space Exploration Team), JAXA, Sovcosmos, the ASA, CSA, UKSA and EUSPA, this 'Global Space Center' is a continually inhabited laboratory, observatory, and factory providing transportation, maintenance, and a low Earth orbit staging base for possible future missions to the Moon, Mars, and asteroids. While the concerns of space remain secondary to many governments, the launching of this monumental project is a sign that humanity has not forgotten about their dreams to conquer the stars."

Among the most prominent examples of the new 'Space Fever' sweeping the nation, is the newfound stardom of one Canadian astronaut: Chris Hadfield. From his degree in aviation systems, to his service during previous joint Soviet-JAASET missions, to being the primary coordinator between the Canadian Space Agency and Sovcosmos, Hadfield is among Canada’s most experienced astronauts. And now, Chris Hadfield serves as one of the three astronauts representing Canada aboard the Global Space Center. As the primary Flight Engineer for the GSC, Hadfield is responsible for some of the most vital day-to-day operations of the Shuttle. Additionally, Hadfield played a key role in the installation of the Center's Mobile Servicing System, better known as the 'Canadarm', a robotic system used in station assembly and maintenance.\n\n Since arriving, Hadfield has quickly gained worldwide attention for his earthward communications, where he details aspects of his life as an astronaut, both the scientific and the mundane. This presence in Canadian media has quickly made Hadfield a celebrity, and has allowed him to exchange wisdom with other visionary minds, providing all of us back on earth with unique perspectives on the great beyond and this blue marble we all call home. In addition to his presence in the media, Hadfield has gained notoriety for his musical talents. Using his trusty Larrivée Parlor guitar brought aboard previously, Hadfield has recorded his own album, 'Space Sessions: Songs From a Tin Can',the first album recorded entirely outside earth’s atmosphere. Throughout his mission on the station, Hadfield has strummed away to countless musical compositions during his time in orbit, including covers, collaborations, and original work\n\n With Hadfield's status as a beloved celebrity only increasing by the day, Canada can once more ponder towards the skies with hope, as the spirit of exploration and scientific development will safely continue to live on in the hearts and minds of all Canadians for generations to come.

When the USA collapsed Blockbuster, along with most pre-collapse businesses, relocated the bulk of their management to Canada in hopes of stabilizing and eventually re-organizing their American locations. However this dream would never come to be, as the American Collapse was more akin to a miniature Civil War than an organized dissolution. This has resulted in many staples of pre-collapse American life living on in Canada, while their locations South of the Border are left to rot. Blockbuster is one such chain which has survived in Canada despite a less-than-ceremonious end in the United States, prevailing in the Canadian market much to the chagrin of Nostalgic Americans (who are known to sneak across the border to relive memories).\n\n While this popular movie rental chain has struggled in recent years due to the expansion of the Intranet, new developments have put Blockbuster on the forefront of a new and untapped market: Intranet Video Streaming. IntraFlix, a chain originally dedicated to the quick delivery of DVDs and VHS tapes through the mail, has quickly broken in to the Intranet Video market; soon becoming champions due to public dissatisfaction with Blockbuster's ubiquitous late fees. Even though an offer had been on the table for Blockbuster to purchase IntraFlix, the common perception in the company that the late-fees were more than enough to sustain themselves prevented them from finalizing the deal. Until recently. Blockbuster today has officially purchased IntraFlix, and thus has taken over the ground floor of Intranet Video Streaming. With Blockbuster now firmly in control of this valuable subset of the market, most analysts predict a bright future for both Blockbuster and the Video Streaming Industry; with many going so far as to predict that the iconic Blockbuster stores may be phased out in favour of an online-centric model."

Nielsen's turning point to comedic roles was marked by his casting for the Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker comedy film Airplane! In his comedic roles, Nielsen specialized in portraying characters oblivious to and complicit in their absurd surroundings. Nielsen's performance in Airplane! led to further success in the genre with The Naked Gun film series, based on the earlier short-lived television series Police Squad!, in which he also starred. For his performances he received a variety of awards and was inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame and the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Though he was a naturalized US Citizen, Nielsen was made an Officer of the Order of Canada, and returned to his home of Regina, Saskatchewan after the collapse of the United States.

Getting off to a rocky start during the Revolutionary Wars and the War of 1812, America and Canada grew to be incredibly close allies, fighting side-by-side in wars such as the World Wars and Korea. And while there has undoubtedly been tension between our two nations at times, America and Canada have stuck together as allies and partners throughout it all. Sadly, our great partnership would come to a bitter end, as the younger sibling of British America: Canada, would prove to outlive their brothers down South. After America's collapse, Canada would grow both as a nation and a global power, and sought to fill the shoes left by the now-defunct United States of America. As America fragmented, Canada took it upon themselves to become the new 'Leader of the Free World', and would extend their wings much in the same way which America did after shedding their isolationist tendencies.\n\n Now, as America seeks to rebuild itself, Canadian and American soldiers have once fought side-by-side for common aims. With the reunification campaign well underway, there are many who believe that the old era of Canadian-American friendship is not far away from being restored in full; albeit on much more equal footing."

However today, citizens of Canada have seemingly been teleported to the day before Reagan's address, as the United States of America - in some form or another, has triumphantly returned to the World State. In Washington rises a new President, and through the chaos and the ashes America has clawed itself away from oblivion. Once more united as Brothers in Arms, Canada and the United States have forged together as allies once more. With the Old Older restored in America, the United States dusts itself off, and readies itself for the final triumph of the Old Order. While this restored United States is drastically different than the America that once was, the America of new forges forward with allies old and new to free the Old World from Communist Tyranny."
