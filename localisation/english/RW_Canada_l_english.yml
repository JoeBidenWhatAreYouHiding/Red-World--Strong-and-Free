 CAN_RED_WORLD_DESC:0 "Canada remains as one of the last beacons of Freedom and Stability in the chaotic Soviet-dominated world. The leader of some of the last few democratic capitalist regimes on the planet, Canada has taken up the mantle of 'Leader of the Free World', flourishing in arenas where Britain and America have failed. While not free from trouble by any stretch of the imagination, 20 years of America's best and brightest fleeing across the border has allowed Canada to assert itself as a great power in its own right. Only time will tell if they can maintain their newfound prowess and take back what has been lost, or if Canada will meet the same fate as their Southern neighbors."

 ### IDEAS ###
 
 # - Starting
 
 CAN_leader_of_the_free_world:0 "Leader of the Free World"
 CAN_leader_of_the_free_world_desc:0 "Left stranded as the last remnant of the Free World, Canada valiantly continues the fight for Freedom, Democracy, and Capitalism in the New World. While the United States has been swept into the dustbin of history, and Britain refuses the call, Canada along with the scattered remitments of the world's Democratic and Capitalist regimes keep up their resistance against Soviet Hegemony. Forced to shoulder the responsibilities of the old United States, Canada will remain steadfast, the last line of defense against Communism. We stand On Guard for Thee, ready to liberate the fallen world once the time comes, or to defend against Soviet Tyranny if they decide to once more incur in the New World.\n\n Our icy cold slice of this blue marble shall always remain free, against all the world; Canada will remain the True North: Strong and Free. "
 
 CAN_buisness_haven:0 "Business Haven"
 CAN_buisness_haven_desc:0 "The collapse of the United States did irreparable damage to the American world of business, as exectives fled from the undeveloped South, and from the former Business hubs of Los Angeles and New York, now in the hands of Communists. In lieu of the highly unstable former United States, the remnants of American Big Business decided to resettle in Canada, taking their wealth and industrial prowess with them. The flight of American Business, while transforming Canada in to an industrial and financial powerhouse, has also infected Canada with a prevailing culture of corruption. The cutthroat world of American Business has sunk its teeth in to Canada, and it appears that for now, the American Corporations have enough funds at their disposal to effortlessly manipulate the Canadian Government into doing their bidding, or simply turning a blind eye to their less than legal practices. "
 
 CAN_american_immigration:0 "Constant American Influx"
 CAN_american_immigration_desc:0 "America was once a land of untold prosperity, however years of stagnation and decline left the United States as a shadow of their former selves. The collapse of the USA was the last straw for many Americans, as a mass exodus from the Former United States followed shortly after. Thousands of Refugees in the border cities fled to Canada in hopes of escaping the coming violence, and to make new lives over the border. This first wave of Refugees from the borderlands was followed soon by countless more coming from the rest of America. While at first they were met with RCMP Officers in Dress Uniforms, and friendly locals greeting them with Tim Hortons Coffee and Donuts, 20 years of unchecked migration has worn thin on most Canadians. While the shared cultural and linguistic links with the US has allowed many Refugees to easily assimilate, many, especially in Quebec, have grown weary of the Americans, and have played into fears that the American Refugees are 'erasing' our Canadian identity. While a larger population has many benefits, especially to our thinly-spread military, there is a general feeling that the American Refugees have overstayed their welcome, leading to a prevailing increase in xenophobic rhetoric towards our Southern neighbors. "
 
 CAN_housing_crunch:0 "Housing Crunch"
 CAN_housing_crunch_desc:0 "While Canada may be vast, only a small portion of our mighty nation is actually inhabited. The slim amount of usable land for housing, combined by a myriad of other factors such as Municipal, Provincial and Federal regulation, the presence of foreign investors, and a rapidly growing population, has made housing prices soar uncontrollably. While lucrative for the Real Estate industry, the unfriendly housing market has made it virtually impossible for average working families to afford homes. Indeed, most of our nation's young have given up any hope of home ownership, and have resorted to increasingly frugal means to keep roofs over their heads. Unless we can control our sharply rising housing prices, it seems as if the best many Canadians can hope for is living in a van down by the river."
 
 CAN_backbench_revolt:0 "Backbencher Revolt"
 CAN_backbench_revolt_desc:0 "Despite the Progressive Conservatives restoring their control of Canada's right, there is still a dedicated contingent of Reform Party Loyalists who refuse to cooperate with Prime Minister Manning. While the Reform Party does collaborate with the PCs, their Caucus is an rowdy and often uncontrollable entity, often attracting members far outside of the reasonable Canadian political spectrum. Prime Minister Manning has done his best to alleviate this, and has had some success in attempts to form a united Conservative front; and while the Reform Party is open to this, there are still many radicals within the Reform Party who bitterly resist any attempts at reconciliation. "
 
 CAN_chalk_river_labs:0 "Chalk River Labs"
 CAN_chalk_river_labs_desc:0 "Nuclear Power is a defining factor in whether nations can be considered Great Powers. While Canada thus far lacks a Nuclear Arsenal, we do possess the raw power and technology needed to enrich Uranium, and the knowhow to construct a functioning arsenal. Despite our aces to Nuclear Secrets, Canada seems content in remaining disarmed, using our nuclear prowess for energy instead of warfare.\n\n The US Nuclear Arsenal, long fallen into disrepair, now lies split between the US Breakaways, with many silos concentrated in the Ultranationalist-controlled territories of Montana and Idaho. While we are willing to tolerate the existence of these 'nations', any sense of a nuclear-threat in the former US, especially by radical regimes, would lead to a swift and deadly Canadian response.\n\n With a large supply of former American Scientists, and access to the nuclear secrets of the old America, it is clear Canada possesses the means to make our own Arsenal; only time will tell if we can justify the ends.

While we are independent nations on paper, in practice we rely on Canada for practically everything, including imports of food, medicine and other vital supplies.

 ### FOCUSES ###
 
 CAN_prime_minister_manning:0 "Prime Minister Manning"
 CAN_prime_minister_manning_desc:0 "Putting an end to the Premiership of the NDP's Bob Rae in 2008, Preston Manning has been the first Conservative Prime Minister of Canada since Brian Mulroney, and on paper has won control of Canada’s diverse Conservative political scene. In practice however, Manning’s Rightwing Bloc is fat from unite, with cracks within his own party beginning to show. While we hope for the best, there are many within the party who fear that the events of 1989 may soon repeat under Manning’s watch..."
 CAN_harpers_folly:0 "Harper's Folly"
 CAN_harpers_folly_desc:0 "The Reform Party is a shadow of its former self, with its death knell being decisively rung when its founder left to join the PCs. While the ProgCons have been thus far content with allowing them to exist, the simple fact is that the Rightwing in Canada can not survive while divided. For the good of our ideology, we must put aside our differences with the Reformites. Prime Minister Manning shall arrange a leader with Stephen Harper, and begin the process to end the division among Canada’s Right."
 CAN_pander_to_reformites:0 "Pander to Reformites"
 CAN_pander_to_reformites_desc:0 "While the Reform Party is a thing of a past, the allignment over their former voters is far but certain. To help keep Conservative voters with the PCs, we shall begin implementing policies friendly to the Reform Party, and allow Reform Members to take prominent places in the cabinent."
 CAN_focus_on_alberta:0 "Focus on Alberta"
 CAN_focus_on_alberta_desc:0 "The results of the 2010 by-elections have revealed a grim lack of attention paid to the Prairie Provinces. Gains made by the Liberals and the NDP in Alberta have alerted us to the possibility of facing catastrophic losses in the region. With this in mind, we shall pay special attention to Alberta and the Prairie Provinces in the next Election, and appealing to blue collar and lower class voters."
 CAN_allign_fiscal_conservatives:0 "Allign Fiscal Conservatives"
 CAN_allign_fiscal_conservatives_desc:0 "While we espouse a certain brand of populism, in all practical terms our party remains more favorable to business interests than the interests of the common man. While some wish to shift our rhetoric to match that of the late Reform Party, we know that staying true to the original Progressive Conservative brand is the way forward."
 CAN_focus_on_ontario:0 "Focus on Ontario"
 CAN_focus_on_ontario_desc:0 "We can do without the votes from some hillbillies in Western Canada; but the votes we have gained from Ontario's wealthy business communities are some we simply can’t go without. Our focus of attention in the next Election shall be centered around Ontario, especially the lofty and well-connected émigrés who have settled around the Toronto area."
 CAN_rehabilitate_mulroney:0 "Rehabilitate the Free Trade Legacy"
 CAN_rehabilitate_mulroney_desc:0 "Brian Mulroney's efforts to establish a truly international Canada could not have come at a worse time. His plans to establish free and fair trade were killed on the same day America was, and in 1989, the Progressive Conservatives as a party nearly suffered the same fate. Although protectionists in our own party and Turnerite Liberals may jump at us, Mulroney's dream must return."
 CAN_2010_democratic_league_review:0 "2010 Democratic League Summit"
 CAN_2010_democratic_league_review_desc:0 "Held off-and-on every one to two years, the summits of the Democratic League provide important opportunities for members to discuss resolutions and put forward policy. This most recent summit, to be held in Sydney, is set to be one of the most energetic yet. The Democratic League is faced with a changing world; a changing world we may be able to play a much bigger part in."
 CAN_british_ties:0 "Repair our Relationship with the British"
 CAN_british_ties_desc:0 "Our relationship with Britain has been frosty ever since they refused our proposal to join the reorganized NATO. Content to sit on their isle and ignore the world, the British don't seem to pay us much mind anymore. Seeking to change this, Prime Minister [CAN.GetLeader] has sent a diplomatic mission to London, a gesture which will hopefully open up the channels with the British once more."
 CAN_our_dependencies:0 "Support our Dependencies"
 CAN_our_dependencies_desc:0 "Alaska and Greenland, on account of their barren physical habitats, are almost entirely reliant on Canada for food and vital supplies. This situation has led to them being dubbed as Canada's 'dependencies', entities which are independent in a technical sense, but are in all practical terms completely reliant on Canada. This arrangement, while beneficial, is cause for a fair amount of bitterness on their end. It is in our best interest to help alleviate this, and help Alaska and Greenland live up to their full potential."
 CAN_attack_the_liberals:0 "Red/Orange Scare"
 CAN_attack_the_liberals_desc:0 "The Liberals and the NDP have been hard at work opposing everything our government does. Despite all that the PCs have done, the opposition has found sucsess at swaying voters away from our cause. We must remind our voters of the tragic tales of the Rae and Ignatieff governments, as a warning of what happens under when the opposition is allowed to take power. "
 CAN_play_into_anti_american_fears:0 "Play into Anti-Migrant Rhetoric"
 CAN_play_into_anti_american_fears_desc:0 "There is a certain feeling among particularly jingoistic Canadians that the countless Americans who have come to call Canada home have overstayed their welcome. While the PCs of old praised these American migrants as an industrious and hard working people, the new PCs realize that they can score some badly needed political points by rallying against them."
 CAN_manning_doctrine:0 "The Manning Strategy"
 CAN_manning_doctrine_desc:0 "The next election is right around the corner, and party insiders have unveiled their plan to lead the PCs to decisive victory. With the Liberals and NDP mobilizing their base, it is clear that 2011 is going to be one of the most hard-fought elections in recent memory. Can the Progressive Conservatives defend their majority? Or will they meet the same fate as the Mulroney Government did in 1989?"
 
 CAN_decision_2011:0 "Decision: 2011"
 CAN_decision_2011_desc:0 "The 2011 Federal Elections have just been held, and Canadians are finished leaving the polls after electing their new representatives. As the polls close, the Canadian people chew their nails and wonder if they will have a new government come morning"
 
 CAN_pc_victory:0 "The Progressive Conservatives"
 CAN_pc_victory_desc:0 "A shocking result to some, the expected outcome to others. Regardless, the PCs have managed to maintain their hold on power. While not nearly as powerful as they were once elected, the voters of Canada have made it clear that they believe the Tories are still worthy enough to compose Canada's government."
 CAN_ndp_victory:0 "The New Democratic Party"
 CAN_ndp_victory_desc:0 "As it turns out, the Conservatives were unable to survive the tumult that plagued their Government since day 1. In their place, the New Democratic Party rises as Canada's ruling party once more. While divided between the Moderate Socialists of Jack Layton and Democratic Liberals of Bob Rae, the NDP remains a coherent entity dedicated to the progress of Canada."
 
 CAN_prime_minister_trump:0 "Prime Minister Trump"
 CAN_prime_minister_trump_desc:0 "A wildly unexpected outcome to anyone not versed in Canadian politics, the victory of American exile Donald John Trump signals a new era for Canada, and for Democracy in the new world. While denounced as a virulent authoritarian and epitome of American privilege by some, others hold Trump up as a herald of prosperity, success and business prowess, and the perfect choice for Canada in her new era as leader of the free world."

 CAN_continue_ontario_partnership:0 "Continue the Ontario Partnership"
 CAN_continue_ontario_partnership_desc:0 "Ontario is Canada's shining beacon of prosperity, a gleaming center of finance and industry that is about as close to the Old New York that you can get. As a native resident of Toronto deeply entwined with the Ontario political scene, Trump has used his ties to aid him in crafting the policies of his government. While Alberta may scoff at this, we must make it clear that our focus is on finance; and finance loves Ontario."
 CAN_sweep_scandals_away:0 "Sweep Scandals Away"
 CAN_sweep_scandals_away_desc:0 "As a PM unrelentingly focused on issues of commerce, Trump seeks to keep the government close to Canada's major financiers. Of course many may denounce this as cronyism and corruption, we have to maintain the course, sweeping any scandals that may come of this under the rug."

 CAN_replace_the_fords_desc:0 "While Trump may be from Toronto, he's not one to ignore potential bases of support just out of regional nationalism. Alberta, while more rural than the hustle and bustle of Toronto, is a wealthy region and the epicenter of Canada's oil industry. Far removed from the hubs of the Laurentian Elite which Trump belongs to, Calgary shall serve as a suitable second base of Trump's focus outside of his Toronto residences."
 CAN_establishment_cabinet:0 "An Establishment Cabinet"
 CAN_establishment_cabinet_desc:0 "While Trump is a newcomer on the Canadian political scene, he has enough good sense to understand how things are run. The ProgCon financiers and powerful political allies shall serve as our new key benefactors, solidifying Trump's support both at home and out West."

Canada is the hub of finance in the New World, and with the Soviet Economy badly stagnating, we may soon rise as the most powerful business center in the world. Seeking to capitalize this, Prime Minister Trump has capitalized on our nation's favorability towards big business, encouraging the 'Business Culture' that popped up before the American Collapse to continue in Canada."
 CAN_canada_first:0 "Canada First"
 CAN_canada_first_desc:0 "'Canada First, Canada First'\n\n These words were first echoed by Trump during the campaign trail, but are now the bedrock for actual policy.

 CAN_reverse_free_trade_course_desc:0 "For some reason, today's Conservatives have become obsessed with the ideals of the long-irrelevant failed Conservative Prime Minister: Brian Mulroney. They think that the best way to make Canada a great power is to open up trade paths with everybody; even our sworn enemies. This shall be no more, Trump shall make it clear; Canada isn't open to making deals with Communists."
 CAN_liberalise_oil_industry:0 "Liberalize the Oil Industry"
 CAN_liberalise_oil_industry_desc:0 "The Oil Industry has long been hampered by regulations; regulations which only seek to constrict and prevent businessmen from turning an honest profit. These restrictions shall be made irrelevant, or at least relaxed so that our oil producers can focus on making money, rather than complying with endless lists of regulations."
 CAN_buy_canadian:0 "Buy Canadian"
 CAN_buy_canadian_desc:0 "Trump has identified that a key problem plaguing the Canadian Markets are the cheap and poorly-made products flooding in from America's Steel Belt. To counter this, Prime Minister Trump has instituted a series of regulations and taxes aiming at discouraging Canadians from buying inferior American products, and encouraging our citizens to support our economy and create jobs by purchasing higher-quality Canadian goods."
 CAN_trade_wars_against_communism:0 "Trade Wars Against Communism"
 CAN_trade_wars_against_communism_desc:0 "We have already reversed the free-trade policies that have proven so hurtful to Canada's economy; however, that was only the first step. The next step is leveraging our new economic prowess against our enemies abroad. No more shall Communist nations have access to Canada's markets; the time has come to drive the Reds out of business by hiking tariffs and instituting policies of strict economic protectionism."
 CAN_trump_tax_cut:0 "A Trunp Tax Cut"
 CAN_trump_tax_cut_desc:0 "A core tenet of Conservative beliefs concerns cutting waste and promoting a smaller government. As Prime Minister, Trump has vowed to make these ideals policy, giving the common man a break and making sure the government is run more efficiently. Of course, Canada's most wealthy have received more generous cuts than the common man; after all, they deserve it."
 
 CAN_manning_second_term:0 "Manning's Second Term"
 CAN_manning_second_term_desc:0 "Outpacing those who have tried to stop him, Preston Manning has earned Canada's trust and won himself a second term as Prime Minister of our great country.

 CAN_undercut_the_canadian_alliance:0 "Undercut the Canadian Alliance"
 CAN_undercut_the_canadian_alliance_desc:0 "The best way to keep the Canadian Alliance from gaining traction is to beat them to the punch. We shall strategically implement policies 'inspired' by the CA's platform. This way the Canadian Alliance will steadily lose voters as their right-wing base realizes that the best way to get what they want is to stick by the ProgCons.

 CAN_adress_western_alienation:0 "Address Western Alienation"
 CAN_adress_western_alienation_desc:0 "One of the key factors which led to the creation of the Reform Party was the feeling that Western Canada was being ignored by the Tories in favor of Ontario and Quebec.

 CAN_focus_on_leftwing_threats_desc:0 "We have little to gain by pandering to CA voters; they have made up their minds and we have to accept that. Instead, we should focus on the insidious NDP and Liberal members who will stop at nothing to overthrow the PC government. Our main target of attack shall be on the extreme left, making sure we can pose ourselves as a strategic alternative for more centrist and moderate left-leaning voters.

 CAN_oil_money_desc:0 "While certain environmentalists decry our nation's dependence on oil, we can't possibly deny that we are better off with the funds gained from our vast reserves of Oil. In addition to funding the government, our development of our Oil Industry will create jobs and help us gain votes in the oil-producing Province of Alberta."
 CAN_trade_commissioner_service:0 "Expand the Trade Commissioner Service"
 CAN_trade_commissioner_service_desc:0 "Our very own Canadian Trade Commissioner Service is a network of more than 1000 trade professionals working across the diplomatic field; with offices located across Canada and around the world, mainly in embassies. Expanding our Trade Services, allocating them more funds and hiring more professionals will greatly assist in our ability to foster trade relations worldwide." 
 CAN_a_growing_economy:0 "A Growing Economy"
 CAN_a_growing_economy_desc:0 "The Harper Government has experienced record growth in virtually all economic sectors. Encouraged by our low-corporate tax rates and stable political climate, Canada will remain a haven of economic prosperity for years to come."
 
 CAN_prime_minister_layton:0 "Prime Minister Layton"
 CAN_prime_minister_layton_desc:0 "A dedicated social reformer and beloved figure in Canadian Politics, John Gilbert 'Jack' Layton has become Canada's 3rd NDP Prime Minister. A committed Social Democrat, Layton is perhaps the truest successor of Ed Broadbent, and will ensure that Canada remains a twinking example of what democratic leftism can do for our ailing world." 
 CAN_institute_proportional_representation:0 "Institute Proportional Representation"
 CAN_institute_proportional_representation_desc:0 "The first-past-the-post system robs Canadians of their political dignity, encourages vote splitting and shuts third parties out of the political scene. It is time to end this, modernizing Canada's electoral methods and replacing our antiquated model with one that can better represent the will of Canadian voters."
 CAN_appease_centrists:0 "Appease Rae's Faction"
 CAN_appease_centrists_desc:0 "While Bob Rae may be a controversial figure, and deeply unpopular with some; he still carries water within the NDP caucus. To keep Rae from stirring up trouble, we will have to make some token concessions, hopefully keeping Rae and his ilk from running off with the Liberals."
 CAN_work_with_the_liberals:0 "Work with the Liberals"
 CAN_work_with_the_liberals_desc:0 "While we still don't fully trust the Liberals, we can't deny that they are a friendlier force to us than the Conservatives. We should reach out to the Liberal leaders, hopefully ensuring their support in the event of a minority government."
 CAN_comittment_to_nato:0 "Commitment to the Democratic League"
 CAN_comittment_to_nato_desc:0 "While our party as a whole holds strong pacifist inclinations, we can not deny that the Democratic League is this world's foremost association of democratic states. Long removed from the days of U.S. Dominance, the Democratic League is an undeniable force of good in this chaotic world."
 CAN_legacy_of_the_ginger_group:0 "Legacy of the Ginger Group"
 CAN_legacy_of_the_ginger_group_desc:0 "The Ginger Group was a faction of Labour and Progressive MPs in the 1920s and early 30's who would eventually go on to found the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation; the predecessor of our own New Democratic Party. While by now they have been soundly forgotten, invoking their legacy will allow all true NDP loyalists to remember their party roots as a populist and socialist movement."
 CAN_return_of_the_waffle:0 "Return of the Waffle"
 CAN_return_of_the_waffle_desc:0 "The Radical faction of the NDP, referred to as 'The Waffle', is by now a long dead and buried movement within the party. Despite this, many of the young NDP voters yearn for a return to the day when mainline socialists were a sizable force within the party."
 CAN_encourage_peacekeeping:0 "Encourage an Outlook of Peace"
 CAN_encourage_peacekeeping_desc:0 "While previous Prime Ministers have made a fuss about reclaiming the world from the Soviets, we have little desire to get involved in armed conflict now. While disbanding the Democratic League is not in the question, we can at least support democratic movements in a peaceful capacity."
 CAN_aid_for_refugees:0 "Aid for Refugees"
 CAN_aid_for_refugees_desc:0 "While many have grown tired of those fleeing from oppression Stateside, we can not simply deny the pleas for aid which so often come from those fleeing tyranny down South. The time has come to reorganize our refugee admission system, providing American migrants a pathway to citizenship and assist them with integration in to Canadian Society."
 CAN_social_progressivism:0 "Social Progressivism"
 CAN_social_progressivism_desc:0 "Unlike the 'Progressive' Conservatives, the NDP as a party is legitimately committed to Canadian Progressivism. From supporting same-sex marriage, to raising money for AIDS research, to allowing conscientious objectors, the NDP has worked tirelessly to ensure that Canada's social minorities are free and equal."
 CAN_protect_healthcare:0 "Protect Healthcare"
 CAN_protect_healthcare_desc:0 "While Conservatives foam at the mouth to undo 60 years of progress, we will stand firm, protecting tirelessly the crowning achievement of the NDP as a party: Canada's healthcare system. The brainchild of the NDP's own Tommy Douglas, Layton will make sure that our prized Healthcare System is modernized, and protected from those who wish to privatize it."
 CAN_support_the_homeless:0 "Support the Homeless"
 CAN_support_the_homeless_desc:0 "Homelessness has been an issue near and dear to our Prime Minister, himself writing several books and essays on the matter. To help resolve this matter, we will begin comprehensive plans to renovate Canada's support network, constructing affordable housing and assisting the unemployed with finding work. Additionally, we shall publicly fund homeless shelters with built in counseling services, so Canada's unhoused won't be left to freeze during our frigid winters."
 CAN_take_on_big_buisiness:0 "Take on Big Business"
 CAN_take_on_big_buisiness_desc:0 "Many large American and Canadian businesses feel like they can simply trample the common man, and that the government will do nothing because they're too afraid to lose jobs. Former governments were, but not Jack Layton. Small Business is the heart of Canada's economy, contributing more to job creation than the conglomerates. To assist them, we shall cut the taxes on small businesses while raising the taxes on large companies."
 CAN_encourage_canadian_industry:0 "Encourage Canadian Industry"
 CAN_encourage_canadian_industry_desc:0 "Too much of Canada's industrial prowess has been swallowed up by corporations which have fled from the former United States. To keep the keys to Canada's industry in the hands of Canadians, we shall fund a new string of projects along Canada's steel belt, keeping development mostly in the hands of the government, and only delegating private development to native Canadian firms."
 CAN_take_on_the_banks:0 "Take on the Banks"
 CAN_take_on_the_banks_desc:0 "The Big Banks have long defrauded Canadians under the guise of 'investment'. No longer, we shall ensure that Canada's major financial firms work for the Canadian people, not against them. Sweeping banking legislation will ensure that the masters of finance are not in a position to abuse their status for monetary gain."
 CAN_organize_labour:0 "Organized Labour"
 CAN_organize_labour_desc:0 "The key to a Labour-friendly economy is having workers in a strong bargaining position. Despite the egregious attempts by the Mulroney government to crush Canada's trade unions, our nation's syndicates remain strong, despite not having the prowess they once enjoyed. To restore the power of Organised Labour, PM Layton will remove the Mulroney-era restrictions on Canada's unions and introduce powerful anti-scab laws to ensure that bosses can't simply replace striking workforces."
 CAN_expand_social_programs:0 "Expand Social Programs"
 CAN_expand_social_programs_desc:0 "Greedy Conservatives have been gunning for our nation's crucial welfare programs, often using such nebulous lies as 'welfare queens' as excuses. Luckily, the NDP is in power, and as a party, we are committed to expanding Canada's many safety nets, ensuring that the Government works to serve our most vulnerable citizens."
 CAN_rate_caps:0 "Rate Caps"
 CAN_rate_caps_desc:0 "The Layton Government has moved to cap credit card rates at five percentage points above the Bank of Canada's prime interest rate. This will help our nation's population claw their ways out of the crippling debt many find themselves in."
 CAN_mixed_economy:0 "A Mixed Economy"
 CAN_mixed_economy_desc:0 "The NDP has managed to transform Canada's economy from a lawless haven for corporate tax-dodgers into a modernized model of Mixed Economics. While we have retained our financial standing, we have also put extensive social welfare nets into practice. Along with the nationalization of major industry and government fixtures, we are in an effective position to ensure that Canada's Economy and Government works for the betterment of the people, not heartless corporations."

 rw_canada.14.d:0 "While Brian Mulroney's legacy has been one of bitter failure, having to bear the sting of losing his own seat, an unprecedented occurrence in Canadian politics, the Manning Government has moved to rehabilitate his legacy, and put forward the shelves policies of the Mulroney Government which were never implemented. Mulroney's dream of Canadian Trade Prowess, long overshadowed by humiliating failures of the Meech Lake Accord and later 1989 Federal Election, has become a hallmark of the modern ProgCon movement, who have moved to open up trade with our shattered Southern neighbors. While we share little in common ideologically with most of the US remnants, we can not deny the potential benefits of establishing business relations with the American breakaways. "

The Ford Family is an influential family within Ontarian politics, and winning the support of the Ford Family would greatly help the PC's chances of winning seats in Ontario, as well as their ability to control their current Ontario MPs. On the Provincial level, the Fords are the main Conservative opposition to Liberal Premier Dalton McGuinty, as well as on the Municipal level, where Liberals such as Joe Pantalone and David Miller still hold influence over Toronto Politics. While the Fords themselves are not free of controversies, they remain as influential benefactors, and will undoubtedly contribute greatly to keeping the PC caucus steady."

Having lost most of the up-for-grabs seats, this disastrous turnout has been cause for a decent amount of panic within the PC caucus. Notably, the Liberals and NDP have picked up many 'safe' Conservative seats in Alberta and Saskatchewan, mostly due to the PCs and Reform Party both running candidates. With the Reform Party undercutting support in the most crucial PC strongholds, it has become clear that the party must re-evaluate its strategy in the upcoming election, especially our strategies relating to the Reform Party."

Whether in hopes of escaping tyrannical regimes, or seeking new jobs and opportunity in the Great White North, these Americans have long been a subject of ire to certain elements within Canadian Society. While previous governments have supported these refugees, the Conservative Government of Preston Manning has begun subtly promoting anti-immigrant rhetoric within his party. Cheered on by figures such as Donald Trump (and American Émigré himself), who has stated that 'When the American People's Commonwealth sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're communists, and some I assume are very fine people'. It is not yet clear if this messaging shift is simply rhetorical, or if it indicated a clear shift in policy; but regardless, it has sent a clear message that Canada may not be as welcoming as it once was..."

 canada_diplo.1.t:0 "2010 Summit of the Democratic League"
 canada_diplo.1.d:0 "The Soviet Order is waning! This has been made clear by the recent assassination of their Premier, Dimitry Yazov in broad daylight. With Yazov dead and various factions within the Soviet Union squabbling and making desperate bids for power, it has become clear that the Union's days are numbered. Even now, the Soviet Order in Europe prepares for the worst, and distant regimes formerly loyal to Moscow now reconsider their allegiances.\n\n This unprecedented opportunity for the Democratic League was the centerpiece of their annual summit in Sydney. Far removed from the sorrow of the 2006 summit in Toronto, the 2008 summit in Anchorage, and the 2009 summit in Honolulu, this assembly of Democratic League members takes place in a new atmosphere of hope for the future. As democratic and capitalist movements have begun resurfacing all over the world, Canada and her allies, for the first time in decades, are in a serious position to challenge the Communist world."

 canada_diplo.2.t:0 "Canada Seeks to Repair Relations"
 canada_diplo.2.d:0 "Our relationship with Canada has been icy ever since we refused their call to join their 'Reformed NATO'. We in the United Kingdom, ever content to sit and guard our island, have increasingly begun isolating ourselves from both the Soviet World Order and the Democratic Remnants across the Atlantic. While we still share monarchical links with Canada, our links via the 'Commonwealth of Nations' have long been severed, and in many ways our relations have never recovered. However the Canadians now seek to change this situation, and have extended the Olive Branch once more in an attempt to restore our old friendship. The opening up of relations with the Canadians is a positive sign that the United Kingdom and Canada can continue to work together as equal partners; and while for now we are content with remaining Neutral, our repaired relationship with the Canadians may open up opportunities for Britain in the future."
