 CAN_RED_WORLD_DESC:0 "Canada remains as one of the last beacons of Freedom and Stability in the chaotic Soviet-dominated world. The leader of some of the last few democratic capitalist regimes on the planet, Canada has taken up the mantle of 'Leader of the Free World', flourishing in arenas where Britain and America have failed. While not free from trouble by any stretch of the imagination, 20 years of America's best and brightest fleeing across the border has allowed Canada to assert itself as a great power in its own right. Only time will tell if they can maintain their newfound prowess and take back what has been lost, or if Canada will meet the same fate as their Southern neighbors."

 CAN_leader_of_the_free_world:0 "Leader of the Free World"
 CAN_leader_of_the_free_world_desc:0 "Left stranded as the last remnant of the Free World, Canada valiantly continues the fight for Freedom, Democracy, and Capitalism in the New World. While the United States has been swept into the dustbin of history, and Britain refuses the call, Canada along with the scattered remitments of the world's Democratic and Capitalist regimes keep up their resistance against Soviet Hegemony. Forced to shoulder the responsibilities of the old United States, Canada will remain steadfast, the last line of defense against Communism. We stand On Guard for Thee, ready to liberate the fallen world once the time comes, or to defend against Soviet Tyranny if they decide to once more incur in the New World.\n\n Our icy cold slice of this blue marble shall always remain free, against all the world; Canada will remain the True North: Strong and Free. "
 
 CAN_buisness_haven:0 "Business Haven"
 CAN_buisness_haven_desc:0 "The collapse of the United States did irreparable damage to the American world of business, as exectives fled from the undeveloped South, and from the former Business hubs of Los Angeles and New York, now in the hands of Communists. In lieu of the highly unstable former United States, the remnants of American Big Business decided to resettle in Canada, taking their wealth and industrial prowess with them. The flight of American Business, while transforming Canada in to an industrial and financial powerhouse, has also infected Canada with a prevailing culture of corruption. The cutthroat world of American Business has sunk its teeth in to Canada, and it appears that for now, the American Corporations have enough funds at their disposal to effortlessly manipulate the Canadian Government into doing their bidding, or simply turning a blind eye to their less than legal practices. "
 
 CAN_american_immigration:0 "Constant American Influx"
 CAN_american_immigration_desc:0 "America was once a land of untold prosperity, however years of stagnation and decline left the United States as a shadow of their former selves. The collapse of the USA was the last straw for many Americans, as a mass exodus from the Former United States followed shortly after. Thousands of Refugees in the border cities fled to Canada in hopes of escaping the coming violence, and to make new lives over the border. This first wave of Refugees from the borderlands was followed soon by countless more coming from the rest of America. While at first they were met with RCMP Officers in Dress Uniforms, and friendly locals greeting them with Tim Hortons Coffee and Donuts, 20 years of unchecked migration has worn thin on most Canadians. While the shared cultural and linguistic links with the US has allowed many Refugees to easily assimilate, many, especially in Quebec, have grown weary of the Americans, and have played into fears that the American Refugees are 'erasing' our Canadian identity. While a larger population has many benefits, especially to our thinly-spread military, there is a general feeling that the American Refugees have overstayed their welcome, leading to a prevailing increase in xenophobic rhetoric towards our Southern neighbors.

 CAN_housing_crunch:0 "Housing Crunch"
 CAN_housing_crunch_desc:0 "While Canada may be vast, only a small portion of our mighty nation is actually inhabited. The slim amount of usable land for housing, combined by a myriad of other factors such as Municipal, Provincial and Federal regulation, the presence of foreign investors, and a rapidly growing population, has made housing prices soar uncontrollably. While lucrative for the Real Estate industry, the unfriendly housing market has made it virtually impossible for average working families to afford homes. Indeed, most of our nation's young have given up any hope of home ownership, and have resorted to increasingly frugal means to keep roofs over their heads. Unless we can control our sharply rising housing prices, it seems as if the best many Canadians can hope for is living in a van down by the river."
 
 CAN_backbench_revolt:0 "Backbencher Revolt"
 CAN_backbench_revolt_desc:0 "Despite the Progressive Conservatives restoring their control of Canada's right, there is still a dedicated contingent of Reform Party Loyalists who refuse to cooperate with Prime Minister Manning. While the Reform Party does collaborate with the PCs, their Caucus is an rowdy and often uncontrollable entity, often attracting members far outside of the reasonable Canadian political spectrum. Prime Minister Manning has done his best to alleviate this, and has had some success in attempts to form a united Conservative front; and while the Reform Party is open to this, there are still many radicals within the Reform Party who bitterly resist any attempts at reconciliation. "
 
 CAN_chalk_river_labs:0 "Chalk River Labs"
 CAN_chalk_river_labs_desc:0 "Nuclear Power is a defining factor in whether nations can be considered Great Powers. While Canada thus far lacks a Nuclear Arsenal, we do possess the raw power and technology needed to enrich Uranium, and the knowhow to construct a functioning arsenal. Despite our aces to Nuclear Secrets, Canada seems content in remaining disarmed, using our nuclear prowess for energy instead of warfare.\n\n The US Nuclear Arsenal, long fallen into disrepair, now lies split between the US Breakaways, with many silos concentrated in the Ultranationalist-controlled territories of Montana and Idaho. While we are willing to tolerate the existence of these 'nations', any sense of a nuclear-threat in the former US, especially by radical regimes, would lead to a swift and deadly Canadian response.\n\n With a large supply of former American Scientists, and access to the nuclear secrets of the old America, it is clear Canada possesses the means to make our own Arsenal; only time will tell if we can justify the ends.

While we are independent nations on paper, in practice we rely on Canada for practically everything, including imports of food, medicine and other vital supplies. While many resent this situation, it is clear that we can't hope to go it alone considering our cold and barren landscapes."

 CAN_prime_minister_manning:0 "Prime Minister Manning"
 CAN_prime_minister_manning_desc:0 "Putting an end to the Premiership of the NDP's Bob Rae in 2008, Preston Manning has been the first Conservative Prime Minister of Canada since Brian Mulroney, and on paper has won control of Canada’s diverse Conservative political scene. In practice however, Manning’s Rightwing Bloc is fat from unite, with cracks within his own party beginning to show. While we hope for the best, there are many within the party who fear that the events of 1989 may soon repeat under Manning’s watch..."
 CAN_harpers_folly:0 "Harper's Folly"
 CAN_harpers_folly_desc:0 "The Reform Party is a shadow of its former self, with its death knell being decisively rung when its founder left to join the PCs. While the ProgCons have been thus far content with allowing them to exist, the simple fact is that the Rightwing in Canada can not survive while divided. For the good of our ideology, we must put aside our differences with the Reformites. Prime Minister Manning shall arrange a leader with Stephen Harper, and begin the process to end the division among Canada’s Right."
 CAN_pander_to_reformites:0 "Pander to Reformites"
 CAN_pander_to_reformites_desc:0 "While the Reform Party is a thing of a past, the allignment over their former voters is far but certain. To help keep Conservative voters with the PCs, we shall begin implementing policies friendly to the Reform Party, and allow Reform Members to take prominent places in the cabinent."
 CAN_focus_on_alberta:0 "Focus on Alberta"
 CAN_focus_on_alberta_desc:0 "The results of the 2010 by-elections have revealed a grim lack of attention paid to the Prairie Provinces. Gains made by the Liberals and the NDP in Alberta have alerted us to the possibility of facing catastrophic losses in the region. With this in mind, we shall pay special attention to Alberta and the Prairie Provinces in the next Election, and appealing to blue collar and lower class voters."
 CAN_allign_fiscal_conservatives:0 "Allign Fiscal Conservatives"
 CAN_allign_fiscal_conservatives_desc:0 "While we espouse a certain brand of populism, in all practical terms our party remains more favorable to business interests than the interests of the common man. While some wish to shift our rhetoric to match that of the late Reform Party, we know that staying true to the original Progressive Conservative brand is the way forward."
 CAN_focus_on_ontario:0 "Focus on Ontario"
 CAN_focus_on_ontario_desc:0 "We can do without the votes from some hillbillies in Western Canada; but the votes we have gained from Ontario's wealthy business communities are some we simply can’t go without. Our focus of attention in the next Election shall be centered around Ontario, especially the lofty and well-connected émigrés who have settled around the Toronto area."
 CAN_rehabilitate_mulroney:0 "Rehabilitate the Free Trade Legacy"
 CAN_rehabilitate_mulroney_desc:0 "Brian Mulroney's efforts to establish a truly international Canada could not have come at a worse time. His plans to establish free and fair trade were killed on the same day America was, and in 1989, the Progressive Conservatives as a party nearly suffered the same fate. Although protectionists in our own party and Turnerite Liberals may jump at us, Mulroney's dream must return."
 CAN_2010_democratic_league_review:0 "2010 Democratic League Summit"
 CAN_2010_democratic_league_review_desc:0 "Held off-and-on every one to two years, the summits of the Democratic League provide important opportunities for members to discuss resolutions and put forward policy. This most recent summit, to be held in Sydney, is set to be one of the most energetic yet. The Democratic League is faced with a changing world; a changing world we may be able to play a much bigger part in."
 CAN_british_ties:0 "Repair our Relationship with the British"
 CAN_british_ties_desc:0 "Our relationship with Britain has been frosty ever since they refused our proposal to join the reorganized NATO. Content to sit on their isle and ignore the world, the British don't seem to pay us much mind anymore. Seeking to change this, Prime Minister [CAN.GetLeader] has sent a diplomatic mission to London, a gesture which will hopefully open up the channels with the British once more."
 CAN_our_dependencies:0 "Support our Dependencies"
 CAN_our_dependencies_desc:0 "Alaska and Greenland, on account of their barren physical habitats, are almost entirely reliant on Canada for food and vital supplies. This situation has led to them being dubbed as Canada's 'dependencies', entities which are independent in a technical sense, but are in all practical terms completely reliant on Canada. This arrangement, while beneficial, is cause for a fair amount of bitterness on their end. It is in our best interest to help alleviate this, and help Alaska and Greenland live up to their full potential."
 CAN_attack_the_liberals:0 "Red/Orange Scare"
 CAN_attack_the_liberals_desc:0 "The Liberals and the NDP have been hard at work opposing everything our government does. Despite all that the PCs have done, the opposition has found sucsess at swaying voters away from our cause. We must remind our voters of the tragic tales of the Rae and Ignatieff governments, as a warning of what happens under when the opposition is allowed to take power. "
 CAN_play_into_anti_american_fears:0 "Play into Anti-Migrant Rhetoric"
 CAN_play_into_anti_american_fears_desc:0 "There is a certain feeling among particularly jingoistic Canadians that the countless Americans who have come to call Canada home have overstayed their welcome. While the PCs of old praised these American migrants as an industrious and hard working people, the new PCs realize that they can score some badly needed political points by rallying against them."
 CAN_manning_doctrine:0 "The [GetCanPCLeaderShortHand] Strategy"
 CAN_manning_doctrine_desc:0 "The next election is right around the corner, and party insiders have unveiled their plan to lead the PCs to decisive victory. With the Liberals and NDP mobilizing their base, it is clear that 2011 is going to be one of the most hard-fought elections in recent memory. Can the Progressive Conservatives defend their majority? Or will they meet the same fate that the Mulroney Government met in 1989?"
 
 CAN_decision_2011:0 "Decision: 2011"
 CAN_decision_2011_desc:0 "The 2011 Federal Elections have just been held, and Canadians are finished leaving the polls after electing their new representatives. As the polls close, the Canadian people chew their nails and wonder if they will have a new government come morning"
 
 CAN_pc_victory:0 "The Progressive Conservatives"
 CAN_pc_victory_desc:0 "A shocking result to some, the expected outcome to others. Regardless, the PCs have managed to maintain their hold on power. While not nearly as powerful as they were once elected, the voters of Canada have made it clear that they believe the Tories are still worthy enough to compose Canada's government."
 CAN_ndp_victory:0 "The New Democratic Party"
 CAN_ndp_victory_desc:0 "As it turns out, the Conservatives were unable to survive the tumult that plagued their Government since day 1. In their place, the New Democratic Party rises as Canada's ruling party once more. While divided between the Moderate Socialists of Jack Layton and Democratic Liberals of Bob Rae, the NDP remains a coherent entity dedicated to the progress of Canada."
 CAN_liberal_victory:0 "The Liberals"
 CAN_liberal_victory_desc:0 "In a surprising upset, the Liberals, long thought to be a spent force in Canadian Politics, have managed to outpace both the Progressive Conservatives and their ideological counterparts in the NDP. Now that it's clear that the NDP are not about to outpace the Liberals as the force representing Canada's left, the Liberals can begin implementing their agenda, and undoing the years of damage done under the PCs."
 
 CAN_prime_minister_trump:0 "Prime Minister Trump"
 CAN_prime_minister_trump_desc:0 "A wildly unexpected outcome to anyone not versed in Canadian politics, the victory of American exile Donald John Trump signals a new era for Canada, and for Democracy in the new world.

An influential figure within the Canadian political scene, Trump has thus far been content managing his many enterprises and quietly supporting the Progressive Conservatives. Despite being a personal friend of Pierre Trudeau near the end of his life, Trump has remained a strong supporter of the Progressive Conservatives; often providing them with generous donations of campaign funds. After a brief stint on the Toronto City Council, and a failed run for Mayor of Toronto in 2000, Trump has sought to remain quiet in the realm of politics, and since has only accepted a nomination to the generally apolitical Canadian Senate.\n\n Trump's appointment caused a small controversy, as some accused the PCs of appointing Trump due to his lofty contributions to the Conservative campaign; while Prime Minister Manning maintained that Trump was appointed due to his business expertise, and as a reward for his decades of service to the Canadian Economy. The resignation of Senator Trump to many is a sign that Trump is back at it again, and is moving to become more involved in the Canadian political scene. Prominent whispers surrounding Trump have pointed to a possible Parliamentary run, most likely as a shoo-in in the district of Willowdale, one of the few PC seats in the Greater Toronto Area. "

 rw_canada.5.d:0 "The Member of Parliament for Calgary West, Rafael Edward Cruz has made the papers today for a string of comments made regarding the Reform Party's relationship with the Progressive Conservatives. The Reform Party, while on paper an independent political entity, is heavily aligned with the PCs and are known to collaborate with them on several hot-button legislative issues. This de-facto coalition is a particularly contentious issue for Cruz, who has denounced both the PCs and any attempts by the Reform Party to work with them. According to Cruz, the Progressive Conservatives have sold out the core tenets of Conservatism, and have increasingly given way to psuedo-Socialist and proto-Liberal politics, and are no longer reliable as a right-wing party. Additionally, Cruz has rejected the concept of 'Strategic Voting', stating that a NDP or Liberal Victory would be preferable to a PC one because the Liberals and NDP are at least 'Honest about their intentions'.\n\n This increasing pattern of Reform disloyalty is a large contributing factor to the increasingly grim forecast for our next by-elections, as Reform candidates often attack Conservatives more than they attack their left-wing opponents."

Ever since, relations between Harper and Manning have been strained, with Harper often lending confidence to the PC Government in exchange for certain political concessions. However, this situation seems to be gearing up for a change, as Manning and Harper have begun moving to formally end the PC-Reform divide, and bring the mutinous faction back into the PC fold.

This move, aimed at consolidating conservative strength and influence in the current political climate, represents a major shift in the country's political dynamics. Leaders from both parties have emphasized the need for unity to present a robust challenge to the Liberals and the NDP, acknowledging that a fragmented conservative front has diminished their collective impact in recent elections. This strategic fusion, while widely supported by those advocating for a stronger opposition, has also stirred debate among party members concerned about preserving their distinct ideologies and policies.

This union, aimed at consolidating conservative forces within Canadian politics, has sparked intense debate across the political spectrum. Cruz, known for his staunch advocacy for core Reform Party principles, views this merger as a dilution of the party's foundational values. He articulates his concerns with a fervor that resonates with many party loyalists, arguing that the merger compromises the distinct identity and ideological purity that the Reform Party has long championed. His denunciation is not just a critique of the merger but an impassioned plea for the preservation of the party's unique political legacy.\n\n In public forums and the halls of Parliament, Cruz has been forthright in expressing his disapproval, warning that this blending of parties risks alienating the grassroots supporters who have been the backbone of the Reform Party's strength. He contends that the merger represents a capitulation to political expediency over principle, a move that could erode the trust and support of the party's base. Despite facing opposition from those in favor of the merger, Cruz's stance has struck a chord with a significant faction within the party, igniting a robust internal debate about the future direction of conservative politics in Canada. His position underscores a deep-seated tension within the party, reflecting the broader challenges of balancing ideological integrity with the pragmatic demands of political unification."

This party, named the 'Canadian Alliance', is dedicated to Conservatism in both an economic and social sense, and has promised to undo the decades of Social Reform advanced under the Rae and Chrétien Governments. This party has been described as 'Fascistic' by some, and is without a doubt the most radical player on the organized Canadian political scene.

Mulroney's dream of Canadian Trade Prowess, long overshadowed by humiliating failures of the Meech Lake Accord and later 1989 Federal Election, has become a hallmark of the modern ProgCon movement, who have moved to open up trade with our shattered Southern neighbors.

On the Provincial level, the Fords are the main Conservative opposition to Liberal Premier Dalton McGuinty, as well as on the Municipal level, where Liberals such as Joe Pantalone and David Miller still hold influence over Toronto Politics.

Rae, while the subject of a bitter loss in the 2006 General Election, managed to maintain his party leadership, and has been quietly opposing the Manning Government ever since. However voices within the party have begun loudly pushing for a new NDP leader, with most favoring the energetic Jack Layton. Layton had previously challenged Rae for party leadership in 2003, but was defeated due to Rae's framing of Layton as a radical socialist. Now that tensions have calmed down, Layton loyalists have begun pushing the New Democrats to replace Rae, who is viewed as a weak candidate due to his losses in 2006. Rae loyalists dispute this claim, stating that the loss in 2006 has given him experience, and an opportunity to examine flaws in party strategy.\n\n As the votes trickle in, it is clear that the New Democrat leader in the next election will be..."

An influx of Reform loyalists, mostly centered around Western Canada, has ruffled many feathers in the Ontario-Centric party echelons; much to the dismay of Prime Minister Manning, an Alberta native himself. While united under the umbrella of one party, there are those within the party who wish to take the party in a new, radical direction, either under the guidance of a 'true' PC leader, or under the guidance of a newer Reform loyalist. Manning's stance, while encouraging unity, has often veered towards the 'Progressive' wing of the party, something which has both infuriated, and lent credence to the more radical Rightwing 'Reformist' branch of the party.\n\n Whether Manning can steer the PC ship away from the rocks remains to be seen; but if one thing is for certain, Manning is in for a challenge keeping calm the increasingly loud voices coming from the PC's right."

Manning's stance, while encouraging unity, has often veered towards the 'Conservative' wing of the party, something which has both infuriated, and lent credence to the more moderate Conservative 'Tory' branch of the party.\n\n Whether Manning can steer the PC ship away from the rocks remains to be seen; but if one thing is for certain, Manning is in for a challenge keeping calm the increasingly loud voices coming from PC moderates."

Manning, while a strong leader and the man who saved the PCs from obscurity, is also seemingly a man out of his depth; a stranger stuck in a world where the Progressive Conservatives were honest to their name. Of course, the merger between the PCs and the Reform Party has gained Manning many more valuable allies; even if he has gained an almost equal amount of enemies who still view him as a sellout in the process.\n\n Even if talk of replacing Manning is frowned upon within the party, it can not be denied that the movement within the party to force Manning's resignation is both present and powerful. Manning has denounced these calls, saying that he is the best force to keep the party united as opposed to a purely Reform or PC loyalist. Despite this, there are prominent voices from both wings challenging this assertion, even if a new leader may alienate key voting blocs."

Now, Barr, along with Trump's personal lawyer Lin Wood, have begun crafting new provisions for the Prime Minister's execution of power; vesting in Trump many powers not previously enjoyed by Canadian PMs. This unprecedented move to empower Canada's Head of Government is seen by many as a pathway to the creation of a true Canadian Executive Branch, where the Prime Minister would hold distinct powers and responsibilities outside of Parliament.\n\n The sudden embracement of the unilateral executive models by Trump's legalists could also be a sign that Trump wishes to remodel the Canadian government along 'American' lines, shaping the government to better match the former home of Prime Minister Trump, as well as many within his cabinet.\n\n Considering the ultimate fate of the United States, a great many have encouraged Trump to exercise caution in this matter, lest the Canadian Citizenry view this as a power-grab, or worse an attempt to erode Canada's distinct identity."

The plan for the wall in regards to the Detroit Border details the creation of a wall which would bisect these two deeply connected areas, effectively severing one of Canada's main links for international trade. While we are no friend to the Commonwealth, we can not deny the fact that millions of dollars of trade revenue are generated by trade between our nations.\n\n Trump, ever the protectionist, has attempted to change this in the construction of the wall, and has even gone so far as to suggest tearing down the famed Ambassador Bridge, a hub of Canadian-American Commerce and the site of the first wave of Refugees crossing into Canada."

Not only did you suffer these abuses as children, but as you became parents, you were powerless to protect your own children from suffering the same experience, and for this we are sorry. The burden of this experience has been on your shoulders for far too long. The burden is properly ours as a government, and as a country. There is no place in Canada for the attitudes that inspired the Indian residential schools system to ever again prevail.

The remaining CA loyalists appear to be staying only out of loyalty to Cruz, or because they have burned too many bridges with the PCs.\n\n While the few remnants of the party hoped that Cruz would keep up the good fight, Cruz had officially dissolved the party, citing a critical inability to find candidates to run in subsequent elections.

 canada_diplo.1.o1:0 "The Soviet Order is far from secure."
  
 canada_diplo.2.t:0 "Canada Seeks to Repair Relations"
 canada_diplo.2.d:0 "Our relationship with Canada has been icy ever since we refused their call to join their 'Reformed NATO'. We in the United Kingdom, ever content to sit and guard our island, have increasingly begun isolating ourselves from both the Soviet World Order and the Democratic Remnants across the Atlantic. While we still share monarchical links with Canada, our links via the 'Commonwealth of Nations' have long been severed, and in many ways our relations have never recovered. However the Canadians now seek to change this situation, and have extended the Olive Branch once more in an attempt to restore our old friendship. The opening up of relations with the Canadians is a positive sign that the United Kingdom and Canada can continue to work together as equal partners; and while for now we are content with remaining Neutral, our repaired relationship with the Canadians may open up opportunities for Britain in the future."
 canada_diplo.2.o1:0 "They always were our favourite colony."
 
 canada_diplo.3.t:0 "Canada Supports our Cause"
 canada_diplo.3.d:0 "The Canadians have long been covertly arming and supplying Cascadian rebel groups as a means to weaken the Communist government in Los Angeles. Recently, their efforts to undermine the Pacific Government have born fruit, as a full scale uprising in Cascadia has taken place. The Canadians, as our oldest benefactor, have lent support to our fledgling movement, providing us with weaponry, supplies, vehicles, training, as well as a formal recognition on the international stage. Canada, as the impartial inheritors of the US's former UN Security Council seat, have vetoed many motions by the Soviets condemning the Cascadia rebellion, even if the Soviets have in turn, vetoed many Canadian measures supporting us."
 canada_diplo.3.o1:0 "We appreciate the support."
  
 canada_diplo.4.t:0 "Canada Offers Annexation"
 canada_diplo.4.d:0 "The Canadian Government today has approached [CSD.GetLeader] with a surprising offer. Contained, is a proposal for Cascadia to join Canada as the nation's (NUMBER)th Province, relieving administrative strain on our end while still safeguarding Cascadian autonomy. While those are some who support this move, citing how our original rebellion was simply to escape the clutches of Communist Tyranny, others are more reluctant about giving up our nation's newfound independence."
 canada_diplo.4.o1:0 "We're not interested."
 canada_diplo.4.o2:0 "We will join, only if Canada safeguards our autonomy."
   
 canada_diplo.5.t:0 "Cascadia Joins Canada"
 canada_diplo.5.d:0 "The Cascadian Government has responded to our offer with apparent delight; as the Cascadians have agreed to the proposal and will be joining Canada as our (NUMBER)th Province. Their acceptance was not without terms, as they required us to amend Canada’s Constitution to safeguard Cascadian regional autonomy, as well as granting the newly created Province special rights; such as the right to fly the Doug Flag on the same level as the Canadian flag on government buildings. There were many factors which contributed to Cascadia's decision to join Canada, including their high cost of governance, diplomatic isolation, and weak military. Indeed, it seems that Cascadians were more eager to escape from the Communists than actually run a nation, leaving the Cascadian Republic doomed from the start. The incorporation with Canada is seen as a good middle ground which will allow Cascadia to both maintain it's distinct identity, and enjoy the protection of a larger power. "
 canada_diplo.5.o1:0 "Wonderful."

 canada_diplo.6.t:0 "Cascadia Refuses"
 canada_diplo.6.d:0 "The Cascadian Government has stated that while they are flattered by our generous offer, they would prefer to remain as an independent nation. Despite this impasse, they have stated that they wish to have closer relations with the Ottawa Government; perhaps even membership in the Democratic League. "
 canada_diplo.6.o1:0 "Not what we were hoping for."

 canada_diplo.7.t:0 "Canada Offers Support"
 canada_diplo.7.d:0 "The Canadian Government, while reiterating their opposition to our form of government, has generously offered to supply and aid our struggle against the Government in Philadelphia. Weaponry, Transportation, in addition to supplies and training for our troops have all been provided for us by the Canadians, who wish to use our rebellion as leverage against the APC. Whether this is a precursor to stronger relations between our government and Canada, or merely a case of 'The Enemy is my Enemy' diplomacy remains to be seen."
 canada_diplo.7.o1:0 "We appreciate the support."
 
 canada_diplo.8.t:0 "New England in the Democratic League?"
 canada_diplo.8.d:0 "The Canadians have extended an olive branch, and are oficially offering New England membership in the Democratic League. Some support this move, citing the possibility of a potential Commonwealth invasion, while other more Socialist-minded figures see this as a capitulation to imperialist powers."
 canada_diplo.8.o1:0 "We can join"
 canada_diplo.8.o2:0 "Stay out of it"
 
 canada_diplo.9.t:0 "Canada Proposes Annexation"
 canada_diplo.9.d:0 "The Government in Ottawa has forwarded an interesting proposal to [ROOT.GetLeader], detailing the possible unification between Canada and New England. New England, while in possession of a strong regional identity, does not have a populace overly attached to the concept of New Englander nationhood. Indeed, New England's independence came about as a result of political tensions rather than nationalistic ones. Despite this, there are many within our government who oppose a potential union on the grounds that it would be a capitulation to an imperialist foreign power."
 canada_diplo.9.o1:0 "We can join"
 canada_diplo.9.o2:0 "Stay out of it"
 
 canada_diplo.10.t:0 "New England Joins Canada"
 canada_diplo.10.d:0 "The New Englander Government has supported our proposal for New England to join as Canada's (NUMBER)th Province. New England's acceptance into Confederation as one unified entity has angered some, who wished for Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island to be admitted separately. Regardless, New England has already integrated itself culturally with the rest of Atlantic Canada, with New England being dubbed as the '4th Maritime Province'. Already New England is set to become one of the most powerful provinces within Canada, and a bulwark of Progressive Politics in Canada; with virtually every seat in New England being won by the NDP in their recent snap elections."
 canada_diplo.10.o1:0 "Good news."
  
 canada_diplo.11.t:0 "New England Refuses"
 canada_diplo.11.d:0 "The Government in Boston has mulled over our offer, and has decided to refuse the prospect of joining Canada. While the tone in their refusal letter varies, the Government of New England has stated that they do not feel comfortable subjecting themselves to the whim of a 'Foreign Power', going further to invoke the Boston Tea party as an example of what happened last time New England was subjugated.\n\n Despite New England's refusal of annexation, some still wish to push for closer ties with New England, while others propose the swift neutralization of this rogue breakaway state."
 canada_diplo.11.o1:0 "Leave them be."

 canada_diplo.11.o3:0 "Take them out."
   
 canada_diplo.12.t:0 "Annexationist Rhetoric on the Rise"
 canada_diplo.12.d:0 "There has been a marked increase in voices calling for Alaska's annexation into Canada. While Alaska has a strong national identity, it seems that much of Alaska's nationalist rhetoric has been drowned out by those who seek incorporation with Canada. This has raised the question of a potential referendum to decide if Alaska should decide to join the Canadians officially."
 canada_diplo.12.o1:0 "Leave them be."
 canada_diplo.12.o2:0 "Hold a referendum on Annexation."
    
 canada_diplo.14.t:0 "Alaska Votes to Join Canada"
 canada_diplo.14.d:0 "There has been a marked increase in voices calling for Alaska's annexation into Canada both within Alaska, and in the Canadian Government. The Alaskan Government has responded to this growing movement by holding a national plebiscite on the matter; a vote which would decide decisively whether Alaska should remain an independent nation, or be officially absorbed into Canada.\n\n This Referendum has concluded with a slim majority voting for incorporation with Canada. This result has been denounced by the Alaskan President and Alaskan independence movements, however has been begrudgingly accepted by the Alaskan Government; which has begun Alaska's transition from independent State to Canadian Province."
 canada_diplo.14.o1:0 "Interesting."
 
 canada_diplo.15.t:0 "No Change in Canadian Situation"
 canada_diplo.15.d:0 "The Alaskan Government has responded to public pressure by declaring they are content with the current situation in regards to Canada. Instead of annexation or independence, Alaska and Canada will continue the situation that has stood for the last 20 years, with Alaska relying on Canada for material support but still remaining an independent nation. The response to this in Alaska has been moot, with some celebrating our continued independence, and others denouncing our continued reliance on the Canadians."
 canada_diplo.15.o1:0 "Interesting."
 
 canada_diplo.16.t:0 "Treaty of Anchorage"
 canada_diplo.16.d:0 "Today, Canadian Prime Minister [CAN.GetLeader] has met with Alaskan President [ALA.GetLeader], detailing new provisions regarding the relationship between Canada and Alaska. This 'Treaty of Anchorage' has returned much of the control over Alaska's Foreign policy back to the Alaskan Government. While unofficial, the Canadian Government has had an unspoken degree of control over Alaskan foreign policy; something which the Treaty of Anchorage aims to reverse. The silent Canadian control over Alaskan diplomacy has oficially ended today, as the Treaty of Anchorage has oficiallized Alaska's complete control over their own affairs."
 canada_diplo.16.o1:0 "Interesting."
 
 canada_diplo.17.t:0 "Resistance against Alaskan Integration"
 canada_diplo.17.d:0 "As the Alaskan government prepares their transition from Nation to Province, the Alaskan citizenry, long used to basking in their self-reliance, have reacted less than kindly to the news that their beloved nation will be no more. While these protests against integration have not been violent, there have been widespread protests across Alaska. The AKIP, the party which led Alaska to independence against the United States, has announced its intention to run candidates on both a Provincial and Federal Level, stating that they will push a platform of Alaska independence from Canada. Additionally, they have promised to practice a strategy of abstentionism if they are to win any seats in the House of Commons. Additionally, several recounts of the referendum votes have revealed a slimmer majority than once thought; leaving many to denounce the results of the vote as being 'Rigged by Ottawa'.\n\n Others have supported these results, and look hopefully on Alaska's future with Canada; drawing parallels with the 1949 Canadian annexation of Newfoundland, and the positive results reaped by Newfoundlanders after Confederation."
