 CAN_RED_WORLD_DESC:0 "Canada remains as one of the last beacons of Freedom and Stability in the chaotic Soviet-dominated world. The leader of some of the last few democratic capitalist regimes on the planet, Canada has taken up the mantle of 'Leader of the Free World', flourishing in arenas where Britain and America have failed. While not free from trouble by any stretch of the imagination, 20 years of America's best and brightest fleeing across the border has allowed Canada to assert itself as a great power in its own right. Only time will tell if they can maintain their newfound prowess and take back what has been lost, or if Canada will meet the same fate as their Southern neighbors."

 ### LEADER BIOS ###
 ###################
 
 POLITICS_CAN_PRESTON_MANNING_DESC:0 "Preston Manning, a champion of the conservative and populist values common in Western Canada, founded and led the Reform Party of Canada to many victories in both provincial and federal elections in the decade following the Great American Collapse. For a time it appeared that his party was on course to usurp the Progressive Conservatives as the major right-wing force in the country after Brian Mulroney's disastrous premiership resulted in a landslide victory for the New Democratic Party in 1989. However, the stabilization period after America's demise and NATO's collapse led to mainstream parties experiencing an enormous resurgence, especially the revitalized PCs. After a devastating loss in the 2000 election, Manning resigned as party leader and subsequently dissolved Reform. For many years he remained retired from politics to become simply a footnote in Canada's history, failing to gain enough seats to govern even at his party's height. However, when the Liberal Party became mired by the biggest corruption scandal in Canadian history, Manning was inspired to once again rejoin the political arena and take down the corrupt establishment. In 2003 Manning officially joined the PCs, and after the Liberal-PC coalition government of Paul Martin fell to the NDP in 2006 he was seen as a clear candidate to restore a true conservative vision to the country. Less than a month later PC members elected him as their next party leader, and in 2008 Manning rode the back of a populist wave to finally become prime minister of Canada. The aging leader has a clear vision for the country but the question remains; does he have the time and influence to achieve it?"
 
 POLITICS_CAN_DONALD_TRUMP_DESC:0 "Donald Trump's journey from New York's Fifth Avenue to Ottawa's 24 Sussex Drive has been nothing short of spectacular. Born and raised in the Big Apple, Donald Trump came from money, being the heir to a multi-million dollar real estate operation started by his father: Fred Trump, owner of Trump Management, a firm which owned several racially segregated middle-class rental housing units in New York City's outer boroughs. Trump would claim that his business career started when his father gave him 'a small loan of one million dollars', and that he was a millionaire by age eight. By 1971 he was President of the company, and began the transformation of the Trump brand into the eponymous staple of the pre-collapse United States. While the Trump brand had experienced ups and down, Trump eventually emerged as a household name in both the Big Apple and Atlantic City, coming to operate dozens of hotels, casinos, and other real estate ventures, and accumulating an almost $200 million net worth. Upon the dissolution of the United States, Trump was one of the countless American financiers who fled the collapsing United States, eventually setting up shop with the rest of his brand in Canada. Throughout his years in Canada Trump has assimilated into the greater Canadian social and political scene, learning French and becoming good friends with former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. By 2000 he was at the helm of a failed run for Mayor of Toronto, and was a powerful force financing the Progressive Conservative party. Landing himself in the Prime Minister's office after Preston Manning's resignation, Donald Trump's ascendancy to Prime Minister comes against the background of widespread skepticism by Canadians. Compared often to John Turner, the first Prime Minister since Mackenzie Bowell to not be born in Canada, Donald Trump may seem like a stranger in a strange land. And while Trump can not deny the ire he has drawn from the Canadian political establishment, Trump remains resolute in plans for 'transferring power from Ottawa, and giving it back to you, the people'."
 
 POLITICS_CAN_JUSTIN_TRUDEAU_DESC:0 "In 1972, President John Ashbrook proudly toasted to the 'future prime minister of Canada: Justin Pierre Trudeau' when he was merely four months old. Born into the political spotlight, Trudeau has finally fulfilled Ashbrook's prophecy, and has risen as Canada's newest and youngest Prime Minister. Standing at the helm of a re-energized Liberal Party, Trudeau has defied the impossible once more and secured the Liberals' status in the spotlight with a smashing majority government. As the first Prime Minister to be the child of a previous holder of the post, Trudeau thinks of himself as the 'Next Great Liberal Prime Minister', and the only man who can shake off decades of rot both in the Liberal Party and in the Canadian Political Sphere. Empowered by his long-shot victory, this young paragon of the Canadian establishment is determined to restore the power and prestige of the Liberal Party, reinstituting an era of pride that began with Laurier, continued with Mackenzie King and Pearson, and ended with his own father. Likening himself to the great Liberal Prime Ministers of the past, Trudeau sees his election as a beginning of a new Liberal era both in Canada and across the world, defeating both the insidious influences of Manning's 'NeoNeoConservatives' and the vile Soviets who seek to strangle the remaining democratic regimes and movements across the world. However only time will tell if he will be able to see through his grandiose vision for both Canada and the Free World."
 
 POLITICS_CAN_MICHAEL_IGNATIEFF:0 "To so many Canada's 'Struggle Against Communism' has been nothing but a vapid buzzword, a meaningless campaign slogan meant to rile up the masses. However, to Prime Minister Michael Grant Ignatieff, a hatred of Bolshevism isn't just good politics, it's in his very blood. Son of George Ignatieff (Né Ignatiev), diplomat, Chancellor of the University of Toronto and the best Governor General Canada never had, Ignatieff would follow in his father's footsteps as an academic. Becoming known for his work as a historian, Ignatieff has held senior academic posts at the universities of Cambridge, Oxford, Harvard, and Toronto. Indeed, Ignatieff possesses a level of comfortability in academic climates that would make you think he made a wrong turn at Rideau Hall and ended up as Prime Minister instead of Governor General. During the late 90's Ignatieff would become known for his work in broadcasting, and would eventually be elected as a Liberal MP for the riding of Etobicoke—Lakeshore. Eventually winning leadership of the Liberal Party, many predicted a humiliating loss for Ignatieff, with projections showing him losing even his own seat. However Ignatieff defied the odds, and now aims to bring his academic prowess into the government as Canada's newest Prime Minister. And while Ignatieff is more than happy to lead Canada against the Soviet World Order, there are still those who think that Ignatieff has a birthright of his own to reclaim."
 
 POLITICS_CAN_STEPHEN_HARPER_DESC:0 "Stephen Joseph Harper didn't see himself as a politician, let alone Prime Minister. Disillusioned by both the Trudeau and Mulroney administrations to which he was formerly loyal, Harper was drawn to the Western Canada-centric Conservative movements which arose during the early 80s'. By the time of the Reform Party's foundation Stephen Harper was merely a graduate student in economics at the University of Calgary; however within a year Harper had risen to the Reform Party's Policy Chief, where he played a major role in drafting the 1989 election platform, otherwise known as the Blue Book, which helped form the principles and policies of the party. While his attempts to run for Parliament in the riding of Calgary West were unsuccessful, Harper remained as an influential figure within the Reform Party, serving both as an advisor and speechwriter to several Reform candidates. By 1992 Harper's relationship with Preston Manning became increasingly strained, with the two titans of Canadian Conservatism becoming increasingly at odds over the party's brand and direction. By 2000 Manning had declared the dissolution of the Reform Party, and led an exodus of Reform MPs to the re-energized Progressive Conservatives. This act would permanently drive a wedge between Manning and Harper, as Harper refused these calls for Reform-PC unity, and would instead attempt to establish the Reform Party as a legitimate force across Canadian Politics. This strategy would bear little fruit, and by 2011 it became clear that the Reform Party's continued existence was a detriment to Canadian Conservatism. Eventually groveling to his former mentor, Harper officially dissolved the Reform Party, uniting the Canadian Right under one banner once more. While this merger was seen as paramount to treason by Reform hardliners, the Reform-PC unification would ironically lead to the Reform Party's ideals becoming mainstream. This phenomenon would coalesce with Harper's rise to Prime Minister after Preston Manning's resignation. Now in power, Harper is determined to forge a brand of unspoiled Canadian Conservatism free from both the trappings of the spineless Red Tories and radicals determined to keep the Reform Movement confined to Western Canada only." 
 
 POLITICS_CAN_RALPH_CRUZ_DESC:0 "Rafael Edward 'Ralph' Cruz has made a name for himself as perhaps the most reviled man in the Canadian Political Sphere. Nonetheless, he now stands as the newest leader of a divided and bewildered nation. As the child of a Cuban refugee who fled from the vile regime of Fidel Castro, Cruz has had a hatred of Communism instilled within him since childhood. Born and raised in Calgary, conflict within the Cruz family nearly sent a young Ralph Cruz to Texas - however the weakness of the American Economy would keep the Cruz's up in Calgary where they worked in the oil business as owners of a seismic-data processing firm. Being brought up with a private education focused on the Free Market and Public Policy, Cruz's prowess in debate would set the stage for his later entry into the Canadian political scene. Later, Cruz would attend class in the University of Toronto where he studied law, and would eventually come to operate a successful private practice. By the time of the United States' fall, Cruz became active in the up-and-coming Reform Party, serving as an aide and advisor to Stephen Harper on a wide range of policy and legal matters. Elected to Parliament in 1993, Cruz would prevail as one of the few remaining Reform MPs who refused to join Preston Manning after he announced his intention to dissolve the Reform Party. As one of the few stalwarts who refused to follow over to the PCs, Cruz’s continuing opposition to any such attempts at reconciliation between the PCs and Reform would make him deeply unpopular to both sides in the Canadian Political Scene. When Harper finally conceded to the PCs, Cruz led the final bitter remnants of the Reform Party to form the 'Canadian Alliance', a hard-right party which would never concede to the spineless establishment. And after almost a decade of PC failures, the Canadian Alliance has finally gained enough sway to form a narrow Minority Government.\n\n While Cruz has seen his life's work come to fruition as Prime Minister of Canada, his uncompromising attitude and radical stances against seemingly the entire Canadian political scene, combined with his virulent unpopularity may serve to complicate Cruz's plans for the future of Canada."
 
 POLITICS_CAN_BOB_RAE_DESC:0 "Robert Keith 'Bob' Rae is a man who is many different things to many different people. His tenure as Premier of Ontario was met with its fair share of successes and failures, and ultimately ended up with a bitter conflict within the NDP bubbling up to the surface. The implementation of the cutbacks which led to the Ontario NDP falling-out with both the public sector unions, and the Canadian Auto Workers Union. Despite this, Rae's support of the NDP during the Broadbent years solidified his status within the party, setting the stage for Rae's eventual transition to Federal-level politics. Defeating Jack Layton in the 2003 NDP Leadership Election, Layton and Rae have been bitterly at each-other's throats ever since. When Rae was swept into the Prime Minister's office in 2005, Layton led a caucus revolt against Rae's 'diluted' NDP, and forced Rae to rely on the rump Liberals to keep his government intact. Losing to Preson Manning in 2008, Bob Rae was returned to the Prime Minister's Seat in 2011. Despite constant challenges from Layton and the NDP's Socialist 'Waffle' Wing, Rae remains committed to defending his Second Term as separate from the chaos of his first. However the question remains if he can follow through. To detractors Rae only seeks to complete the NDP's long path down the road from Democratic Socialism to watered-down Liberalism; and simply opting to wear the skin of the once-defeated Canadian establishment. To many, Rae's victory is the final stop in a road which started at the Winnipeg Manifesto, and ended with the NDP shedding its many union affiliations simply to appease the will of Big Business. However Rae's supporters see him as the man to defeat the evils of Radical Socialism worldwide, and establish the NDP as a moderate force which can triumph over the evils of Godless Communism both in Canada and the world stage."
 
 POLITICS_CAN_JACK_LAYTON_DESC:0 "In an era of Canadian politics increasingly defined by bitterness and anger, Jack Layton stands out as a beacon of hope and positivity in a world consumed by hatred. John Gilbert Layton was the grandson of a cabinet minister in the Government of Quebec Premier Maurice Duplessis, and the son of ProgCon MP Robert Layton. Growing up in an Anglophone suburb of Montreal, Layton's first elected position would be that of Student Council President, later leaving to serve as Prime Minister of the Quebec Youth Parliament. After graduating from McGill, Layton would go on to develop close links with many influential figures in Toronto Civic Politics, eventually landing him a spot on the Toronto City Council. An early champion of many Progressive Causes, Layton's activism would make him both many enemies and many friends, and would lead Layton to become de-facto leader of a coalescing left-wing coalition on the Toronto City Council. And while he would never become Mayor, Layton would catch the attention of the NDP the nation over with his charisma and Progressive bend. By 2003 Layton was a shoo-in for Federal NDP leader, being prominently backed by Ed Broadbent; however this ill-fated attempt would be defeated by former Ontario Premier Bob Rae, who united many center-left voters against Layton with baseless claims of Communist links. Despite this, 2003 would become the year where Layton became a household name in Canada, and put him at the center of a growing movement of NDP voters dissatisfied with the party's rightward shift. After the election of Bob Rae, Layton would come to lead a Backbench Revolt against Rae for pushing certain policies deemed to be anti-union. This event would force Rae to rely on the Liberals to stay afloat, and would ultimately see the return of the Progressive Conservatives in 2008. After the 'Layton Affair', Rae would admit defeat and resign as NDP leader, paving the way for a smashing comeback by Layton. Now Prime Minister, Layton stands resolute in his determination to keep the NDP from becoming just like the establishment they fought so hard to uproot. In a voice echoed by voters across Canada, Layton has declared that enough is enough with Liberal arrogance and scandals and enough to the vote-buying promises of the Conservatives. There's a better choice, a third option, the NDP."
 
 POLITICS_CAN_TRUMPNET_DESC:0 "Donald Trump's death at the hands of a deranged assassin was once seen as an undeniable fact to all but the most devout followers of 'Q'. However one fateful day, Canadian households were awoken to a truly miraculous sight: Donald Trump, alive as you or me... almost. While '§BTrump§!' spoke, people noticed that something was amiss, and indeed, the version of Trump all Canadians saw on their telesets was not indeed the real Donald J. Trump. Peter Thiel, chosen as §RTrump's§! successor, remarked on a truly groundbreaking project, one which brought the dead back to life. Utilizing an Artificial Intelligence model run by decades of Trump's writing, speech pattern, and memories, the slain Prime Minister lives once more. While this supposed 'Trump' is claimed to be a perfect replica of the late Prime Minister's consciousness, in reality, the AI Trump or '§BTrumpnet§!' is nothing more than a chatbot which takes in responses and spits out garbled responses cobbled from a massive array of data, which replicates to the best of its ability §RTrump's§! personality and leadership style. While technically 'Prime Minister', this new §BTrump§! holds no power, only serving to speak on behalf of Peter Thiel with an image of the late Prime Minister's face, manipulated to speak with Thiel's ever-mysterious AI technology. Some have already decried this new Trump as nothing more than a 'Mechanical Abomination'. §RTrump's§! own family has denounced this course of action as 'ghoulish'. Followers of Q have declared Thiel to be the Antichrist, using the power of necromancy to bring §RTrump§! back to life, and cutting off the face of a dead man and wearing it. Yet despite the comotion, nothing has changed.\n\n...Trump Lives?"

 CAN_leader_of_the_free_world:0 "Leader of the Free World"
 CAN_leader_of_the_free_world_desc:0 "Left stranded as the last remnant of the Free World, Canada valiantly continues the struggle for freedom, for justice, and for the liberation of all mankind. While the United States has been swept into the dustbin of history, and Britain refuses the call, Canada along with the scattered remnants of the world's Democratic and Capitalist regimes keep up their resistance against Soviet Hegemony. Forced to shoulder the responsibilities of the old United States, Canada will remain steadfast, the last line of defense against Communism. We stand On Guard for Thee, ready to liberate the fallen world once the time comes, or to defend against Soviet Tyranny if they decide to once more incur in the New World.\n\n Our icy cold slice of this blue marble shall always remain free, against all the world; Canada will remain the True North: Strong and Free."
 
 CAN_buisness_haven:0 "Business Haven"
 CAN_buisness_haven_desc:0 "The collapse of the United States did irreparable damage to the American world of business, as executives fled from the undeveloped South, and from the former Business hubs of Los Angeles and New York, now in the hands of Communists. In lieu of the highly unstable former United States, the remnants of American Big Business decided to resettle in Canada, taking their wealth and industrial prowess with them. The flight of American Business, while transforming Canada into an industrial and financial powerhouse, has also infected Canada with a prevailing culture of corruption. The cutthroat world of American Business has sunk its teeth in to Canada, and it appears that for now, the American Corporations have enough funds at their disposal to effortlessly manipulate the Canadian Government into doing their bidding, or simply turning a blind eye to their less than legal practices."
 
 CAN_american_immigration:0 "Constant American Influx"
 CAN_american_immigration_desc:0 "America was once a land of untold prosperity, however years of stagnation and decline left the United States as a shadow of their former selves. The collapse of the USA was the last straw for many Americans, as a mass exodus from the Former United States followed shortly after. Thousands of Refugees in the border cities fled to Canada in hopes of escaping the coming violence, and to make new lives over the border. This first wave of Refugees from the borderlands was followed soon by countless more coming from the rest of America. While at first they were met with RCMP Officers in Dress Uniforms, and friendly locals greeting them with Tim Hortons Coffee and Donuts, 20 years of unchecked migration has worn thin on most Canadians. While the shared cultural and linguistic links with the US has allowed many Refugees to easily assimilate, many, especially in Quebec, have grown weary of the Americans, and have played into fears that the American Refugees are 'erasing' our Canadian identity. While a larger population has many benefits, especially to our thinly-spread military, there is a general feeling that the American Refugees have overstayed their welcome, leading to a prevailing increase in xenophobic rhetoric towards our Southern neighbors."

 CAN_housing_crunch:0 "Housing Crunch"
 CAN_housing_crunch_desc:0 "While Canada may be vast, only a small portion of our mighty nation is actually inhabited. The slim amount of usable land for housing, combined by a myriad of other factors such as Municipal, Provincial and Federal regulation, the presence of foreign investors, and a rapidly growing population, has made housing prices soar uncontrollably. While lucrative for the Real Estate industry, the unfriendly housing market has made it virtually impossible for average working families to afford homes. Indeed, most of our nation's young have given up any hope of home ownership, and have resorted to increasingly frugal means to keep roofs over their heads. Unless we can control our sharply rising housing prices, it seems as if the best many Canadians can hope for is living in a van down by the river."
 
 CAN_backbench_revolt:0 "Backbencher Revolt"
 CAN_backbench_revolt_desc:0 "Despite the Progressive Conservatives restoring their control of Canada's right, there is still a dedicated contingent of Reform Party Loyalists who refuse to cooperate with Prime Minister Manning. While the Reform Party does collaborate with the PCs, their Caucus is an rowdy and often uncontrollable entity, often attracting members far outside of the reasonable Canadian political spectrum. Prime Minister Manning has done his best to alleviate this, and has had some success in attempts to form a united Conservative front; and while the Reform Party is open to this, there are still many radicals within the Reform Party who bitterly resist any attempts at reconciliation."
 
 CAN_chalk_river_labs:0 "Chalk River Labs"
 CAN_chalk_river_labs_desc:0 "Nuclear Power is a defining factor in whether nations can be considered Great Powers. While Canada thus far lacks a Nuclear Arsenal, we do possess the raw power and technology needed to enrich Uranium, and the knowhow to construct a functioning arsenal. Despite our aces to Nuclear Secrets, Canada seems content in remaining disarmed, using our nuclear prowess for energy instead of warfare.\n\n in The US Nuclear Arsenal, long fallen into disrepair, now lies split between the US Breakaways, with many silos concentrated in the Ultranationalist-controlled territories of Montana and Idaho. While we are willing to tolerate the existence of these 'nations', any sense of a nuclear-threat in the former US, especially by radical regimes, would lead to a swift and deadly Canadian response.\n\n With a large supply of former American Scientists, and access to the nuclear secrets of the old America, it is clear Canada possesses the means to make our own Arsenal; only time will tell if we can justify the ends."

 CAN_subject_reliance_on_canada:0 "Reliance on Canada"
 CAN_subject_reliance_on_canada_desc:0 "While we are grateful to the Canadians for saving us from the mires of chaos, we can not deny the influence, however unspoken it may be, over the day-to-day running of our nation. While we are independent nations on paper, in practice we rely on Canada for practically everything, including imports of food, medicine and other vital supplies. While many resent this situation, it is clear that we can't hope to go it alone considering our cold and barren landscapes."

While we are willing to tolerate the existence of these 'nations', any sense of a nuclear-threat in the former US, especially by radical regimes, would lead to a swift and deadly Canadian response.\n\n With a large supply of former American Scientists, and access to the nuclear secrets of the old America, it is clear Canada is has both the means and the will to construct a formidable Nuclear Arsenal."

For the good of our ideology, we must put aside our differences with the Reformites. Prime Minister Manning shall arrange a leader with Stephen Harper, and begin the process to end the division among Canada’s Right."

With this in mind, we shall pay special attention to Alberta and the Prairie Provinces in the next Election, and appeal to blue collar and lower class voters."
 CAN_allign_fiscal_conservatives:0 "Align Fiscal Conservatives"
 CAN_allign_fiscal_conservatives_desc:0 "While we espouse a certain brand of populism, in all practical terms our party remains more favorable to large business interests than the interests of small donors.

 CAN_focus_on_ontario:0 "Focus on Ontario"
 CAN_focus_on_ontario_desc:0 "We can do without the votes from some hillbillies in Western Canada; but the votes we have gained from Ontario's wealthy business communities are some we simply can’t go without.

 CAN_rehabilitate_mulroney_desc:0 "Brian Mulroney's efforts to establish a truly international Canada could not have come at a worse time. His plans to establish free and fair trade were killed on the same day America was, and in 1989, the Progressive Conservatives as a party nearly suffered the same fate.

Content to sit on their isle and ignore the world, the British don't seem to pay us much mind anymore. Seeking to change this, Prime Minister [CAN.GetLeader] has sent a diplomatic mission to London, a gesture which will hopefully open up the channels with the British once more."

 CAN_our_dependencies_desc:0 "Alaska and Greenland, on account of their barren physical habitats, are almost entirely reliant on Canada for food and vital supplies. This situation has led to them being dubbed as Canada's 'dependencies', entities which are independent in a technical sense, but are in all practical terms completely reliant on Canada. This arrangement, while beneficial, is cause for a fair amount of bitterness on their end. It is in our best interest to help alleviate this, and help Alaska and Greenland live up to their full potential."

Trump, still viewed with suspicion by much of the Canadian populace, has sought to reinvigorate Canadian patriotism, instilling in this meek people the value of loving their country and shedding his past association as an emigré. America was once the land of the free, but they're gone now. Canada is the rightful successor of all that America once stood for: Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."

 CAN_reverse_free_trade_course:0 "Reverse the Free Trade Course"

His first term as Prime Minister, marred by conflict with organized labour and accusations of corruption, would ultimately not last; defeated by Manning's reinvigorated Progressive Conservatives. With Manning defeated once more, Prime Minister Rae has returned to finish the job, and ensure that the NDP, and Canada, will remain beacons of center-left Democratic thought."
 CAN_a_fair_vote:0 "A Fair Vote"
 CAN_a_fair_vote_desc:0 "The time has come for Canada to institute comprehensive electoral reform. The first-past-the-post system robs Canadians of their political dignity, encourages vote splitting and shuts third parties out of the political scene. Instead, we shall switch to a more fair system of proportional representation."
 CAN_sway_the_liberals:0 "Swaying the Liberals"
 CAN_sway_the_liberals_desc:0 "Rae is by far the friendliest leader towards the Liberal Party that the NDP has ever had. Indeed, many have accused Rae of being a crypto-liberal, who's loyalty to the NDP cause only extends out of brazen opportunism. Many have gone so far as to wonder if Rae would have joined the Liberals if they had more electoral success. As political entities with much alike, we can gain much by entering an informal coalition with the Liberals."
 CAN_new_broad_front:0 "A New Broad Front"
 CAN_new_broad_front_desc:0 "Many within our party have unrealistic focuses on irrelevant feel-good issues; Rae however knows more about governing than these groups of idealistic youngsters. If we are to defeat the Progressive Conservatives, then we must look inwards, and ensure that all center-left groups in Canada are represented fairly. This supply-confidence agreement with the Liberals will also afford us some leeway if we happen to anger more socialist-leaning members of our party."
 CAN_the_merger:0 "The Merger"
 CAN_the_merger_desc:0 "In recent days and months the NDP and Liberals have grown closer than ever. While the Liberals are stubborn and prideful, they are also realistic; and the fact is that the party has had little success since the Pierre Trudeau days. The best course of action for both our parties would be a formal merger."
 CAN_prevent_backbench_revolt:0 "Prevent a Backbencher Revolt"
 CAN_prevent_backbench_revolt_desc:0 "Despite Rae's resentment, the simple fact is that the vast majority of NDP voters and representatives are on the socialist left. While Rae wishes to distance himself from this wing of the party, he has to be realistic in his strategies. For now, at least, we will have to appease our left-wing, and implement some token policies favorable to them."
 CAN_appease_layton:0 "Appease Layton"
 CAN_appease_layton_desc:0 "Jack Layton is an ever persistent figure within the realm of Canada's left, and unfortunately for Rae, a figure who often enjoys more support than he does. An always present threat is Layton pulling a 'Waffle' and starting up his own party; only this time, there is a legitimate possibility that he may take half of the NDP with him. To prevent this, we will ensure that Layton's voice is heard in the government; no matter how painful that may be for Prime Minister Rae."
 CAN_liberals_at_arms_length:0 "The Liberals at Arm's Length"
 CAN_liberals_at_arms_length_desc:0 "While we have much in common with the Liberals, we do not wish for our partnership with them to be anything more than informal. We shall ensure we implement policies friendly to the Liberals, and encourage them to vote on our legislation, but that's it. Our supply-confidence agreement shall go no further."
 CAN_humanitarian_focus:0 "A Humanitarian Focus"
 CAN_humanitarian_focus_desc:0 "Any good samaritan would be appalled by the situation on our southern border. The millions fleeing from appealing political and economic conditions down south at great risk to themselves is a crisis that has long weighed heavy on the nation's conscience. To help this ever-present issue, Prime Minister Rae has helped to make the process of moving to Canada safer, and opening up more legal means for Americans to immigrate to Canada and better integrate with Canadian society."
 CAN_a_moderate_ndp:0 "A Moderate NDP, a Moderate Canada"
 CAN_a_moderate_ndp_desc:0 "While there are certain nostalgics who yearn for the days when the NDP was an openly socialist movement, we have managed to transform this great party from a beacon of godless socialism to a proudly moderate movement. No longer will voters be too afraid of Soviet dominance to cast a vote for the New Democrats, as Bob Rae has banished even the slightest trace of socialism from the party."
 CAN_expand_public_insurance:0 "Expand Public Insurance"
 CAN_expand_public_insurance_desc:0 "First introduced during Rae's tenure as Premier of Ontario, then expanded nationwide during his first term as Prime Minister, Rae has sought to expand his hallmark system of public insurance. Originally designed to cover auto insurance, Prime Minister Rae will expand this system to also cover health insurance, with additional options provided for home and property insurance."
 CAN_job_creation_programs:0 "Job Creation Programs"
 CAN_job_creation_programs_desc:0 "The scourge of unemployment has long plagued the people of Canada. To combat this, Prime Minister Rae has put forward a variety of programs aimed at creating more jobs for the people of Canada."
 CAN_increase_social_spending:0 "Increase Social Spending"
 CAN_increase_social_spending_desc:0 "While our government is intent on keeping a balanced budget, we can not deny the people of Canada vital public services. Accordingly, our spending on social safety nets shall be increased, while we work to cut costs in other non-essential areas."
 CAN_civil_service_cuts:0 "Civil Service Cuts"
 CAN_civil_service_cuts_desc:0 "To help alleviate pressures within our bureaucracy, we will mandate that all civil servants take at least 12 days of unpaid vacation. This model, first introduced when Rae was Premier of Ontario, has helped keep cost down, with these days of unpaid leisure being dubbed as 'Rae days'."
 CAN_pro_business_policies:0 "Pro-Business Policies"
 CAN_pro_business_policies_desc:0 "While certain figures within the NDP wish to hike corporate tax rates, and drive business out of Canada, Prime Minister Rae sees that the best way to ensure Canadian prosperity is to keep business within Canada. The Rae Government is committed to being a champion of the international corporation working against the expansion of workers' wages and government services."
 CAN_global_investment_networks:0 "A Global Investment Network"
 CAN_global_investment_networks_desc:0 "Canada is a haven of world finance, but we are not alone in the world of global commerce. To help connect ourselves with the wider world, the Rae Government shall create a global network of capitalist regimes, bettering our relations with other havens of business and allowing Canada to better conduct international trade."
 CAN_democratic_economic_forum:0 "A Democratic Economic Forum"
 CAN_democratic_economic_forum_desc:0 "The next step in transforming Canada into the world's leader in matters of commerce is to create a formal organization dedicated to improving the state of the world by engaging business, political, academic, and other leaders of society to shape global, regional, and industry agendas. This organization shall consist of the world's remaining capitalist democracies, and will be known as the 'Democratic Economic Forum'."
 CAN_nationwide_social_contract:0 "Renew the Social Contract"
 CAN_nationwide_social_contract_desc:0 "First introduced in Ontario, the 'Social Contract' was a piece of legislation first introduced in Ontario which froze wages and introduced unpaid vacation. While this was vastly unpopular with the NDP base and the Trade Unions, introducing this policy on a nationwide level will aid in helping Canada's economy grow."
 CAN_lip_service_to_labour:0 "Lip Service to Organised Labour"
 CAN_lip_service_to_labour_desc:0 "While Rae has something of a checkered past with Organized Labour, first starting during the 'Social Contract' in Ontario. To help smooth over our relations with the Trade Unions, we shall introduce our own anti-scab legislation."
 CAN_mulroneys_dream_from_a_liberal_perspective:0 "Mulroney's Dream from a Liberal Perspective."
 CAN_mulroneys_dream_from_a_liberal_perspective_desc:0 "The dream of a free trade zone in North America, while originally put forward by the Conservative Mulroney Government, has been co-opted by Bob Rae's NDP Government. Canada shall become a world leader in trade, allowing jobs and economic prosperity to flow across the border."
 
 CAN_prime_minister_ignatieff:0 "Prime Minister Ignatieff"
 CAN_prime_minister_ignatieff_desc:0 "Michael Ignatieff is many things; an author, an academic, and a notable television and radio broadcaster, and now, Canada's newest Prime Minister. While viewed by the common public as 'bland', Ignatieff's no-nonsense and common sense style of government is just what the nation needs at a time like this. It's time for a government that puts substance over flash!"
 CAN_the_lesser_evil:0 "The Lesser Evil"
 CAN_the_lesser_evil_desc:0 "We find ourselves in an unprecedented age in global politics, an age where danger no longer lurks in the corner, but hides in familiar faces. The subject of how to balance our liberal democracies with the ever present need for security is a common point of contention for the Ignatieff government, who has increasingly opened up to the policy of suspending certain civil liberties in the name of protecting our country. While this may be unacceptable to some, we have to accept that sometimes our need for security is greater than our need for liberty."
 CAN_legacy_of_martin:0 "Martin's Legacy"
 CAN_legacy_of_martin_desc:0 "Paul Martin, while being Canada's shortest-lived Prime Minister, was still perhaps one of the most impactful. As a PM voted out before his time, Paul Martin will surely have some valuable insights into how we should run our government."
 CAN_right_liberalism:0 "Right-Liberalism"
 CAN_right_liberalism_desc:0 "Paul Martin has made it clear that his fatal undoing wasn't that he didn't pander enough to the left. Far from it indeed, the reason why the Liberals were faced with such catastrophic losses is we gravitated too far from the right. There's already a party for hippies and socialists and it's called the NDP; we’re the Liberals, so let's commit to Liberalism."
 CAN_legacy_of_chretien:0 "Chrétien's Legacy"
 CAN_legacy_of_chretien_desc:0 "Jean Chrétien, the last Liberal Prime Minister since Ignatieff, is a polarizing figure. While beloved by many, his tenure was cut short by disagreements within his own party. While his tenure was short, it was also impactful, paving the way for some of Canada's most impactful legislation. Perhaps we should consult this veteran Liberal for advice on governing Canada?"
 CAN_social_liberal_coalition:0 "A Coalition of the Left"
 CAN_social_liberal_coalition_desc:0 "It has become clear to us that the devastating losses inflicted in recent years to the Liberals were not as a result of our party going too far left. In fact it was quite the opposite; our party had lost touch with its roots. The Liberals are a left-wing movement, and we best start acting like it lest we lose more of our vote share to the NDP."
 CAN_immigration_fairness:0 "Fairness in Immigration"
 CAN_immigration_fairness_desc:0 "Too long have the unwashed masses simply hopped across the border without a second thought. The time has come to better police our southern borders, and establish a new 'Immigration Fairness Commissioner' to provide oversight on the entry of immigrants with professional qualifications."
 CAN_higher_education_passport:0 "Higher Education Passport"
 CAN_higher_education_passport_desc:0 "During the election cycle, the Liberals promised a "Learning Passport" for high school students seeking post-secondary education. It is time to make good on this promise, allowing this nation's young up-and-comers to get a good education without being crushed under the weight of crippling debt."
 CAN_no_more_scandals:0 "No More Scandals"
 CAN_no_more_scandals_desc:0 "Perhaps the most influential factor that contributed to the Liberals 20 year long slump was the fact that the party was almost constantly gripped by scandals. Exemplified during the Martin Years, these scandals gave the people of Canada the wrong image about our party, and gave our voters a carte blanche to flock to the NDP en masse. Luckily, the Ignatieff Government has done its best to clean the unsavory image of our party that has been painted throughout the years."
 CAN_philosophical_liberalism:0 "Philosophical Liberalism"
 CAN_philosophical_liberalism_desc:0 "Liberalism is the time-honored doctrine shaped by centuries of political success and crafted by some of the greatest minds in history - a creed which we are proud to call our own. While some may be more concerned with results than ideals, here in Canada we have been given a unique opportunity to look inward, ask the tough questions. The time has come to finally pull the sword of political governance out of the stone of political theory. After all, politics is just as much about intention as it is about results."
 CAN_new_sponsorships:0 "Big Business Sponsorships"
 CAN_new_sponsorships_desc:0 "Canada is a land of business and finance, providing Canadians with countless jobs and opportunities. They have contributed so much to Canada, so why shouldn't we be allowed to contribute a little back?\n\n Awarding contracts to some of Canada's most 'generous' companies is a sure way to show our appreciation."
 CAN_competitive_tax_increases:0 "Competitive Tax Increases"
 CAN_competitive_tax_increases_desc:0 "The NDP wants to hike corporate taxes high enough to drive business out of Canada, and the PCs want to slash them altogether. Both of these strategies are dangerous and irresponsible and dangerous both for our markets and the people of Canada. Instead, we shall make minor increases to the corporate tax rate, enough to make them pay their fair share while still keeping these companies investing in Canada and Canadians."
 CAN_balance_the_books:0 "Balance the Books"
 CAN_balance_the_books_desc:0 "Certain figures within our party wish to take on massive deficits to pay off government expenses; something which Prime Minister Ignatieff is firmly against. Canada shall embark on a more restrained fiscal policy that will keep more money in the pockets of Canadian Citizens by cutting wasteful spending."
 CAN_pay_down_the_deficit:0 "Pay Down the Deficit"
 CAN_pay_down_the_deficit_desc:0 "Canada's debt to GDP ratio is too high for a developed nation. While they Mulroney and Manning governments claimed to be conservatives, they ran up massive deficits that Canada is still paying down. The time has come to pay down our debt, and make sure that Canada is no longer trapped in the webs by foreign creditors."
 CAN_in_the_green:0 "In the Green!"
 CAN_in_the_green_desc:0 "A policy of fiscal restraint and anti-borrowing measures has allowed Canada's policy to tally a massive surplus. Our economic future is bright as Canada's economy continues to grow unrestrained long into the future."
 
 CAN_prime_minister_trudeau:0 "Prime Minister Trudeau"
 CAN_prime_minister_trudeau_desc:0 "Son of the late former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, Justin Trudeau has managed to defy the Liberals' ill-fortune and edge out a decisive victory. While viewed by some as too young and inexperienced, to others Justin Trudeau is just the breath of fresh air that the Canadian political scene needs."
 CAN_reform_the_senate:0 "Reform the Senate"
 CAN_reform_the_senate_desc:0 "For too long, appointments to the Canadian Senate have been nakedly political, unelected lifetime commitments awarded predominantly to prominent donors. It is time to end this system of Senate cronyism, making sure that the Senate remains nonpartisan. While a far cry from actual comprehensive Senate reform, this new legislation should at least contribute to keeping the Senate neutral."
 CAN_legalize_marijuana:0 "Legalise Marijuana"
 CAN_legalize_marijuana_desc:0 "Smoke 'em if you got 'em, as Canada becomes one of this world's few bastions of completely legal weed. Now that we can safely move away from our War on Drugs area policies on marijuana, we can gain new economic opportunities in the pot business, as well as extra taxable income from marijuana sales."
 CAN_beacon_against_tyranny:0 "A Shining Beacon Against Tyranny"
 CAN_beacon_against_tyranny_desc:0 "Canada stands as one of the few beacons of Liberty and Democracy in a world overrun by authoritarians. Politicians in the past have failed to realize that Canada has been shouldered the responsibility as leader of the Free World, still living in the days of Canada as a mere middle power. Trudeau however realizes Canada's newfound responsibility; and will tirelessly work to ensure that Canada is the shining beacon torchlight of Freedom in a dark and derelict world."
 CAN_indigenous_commitments:0 "Indigenous Commitments"
 CAN_indigenous_commitments_desc:0 "Trudeau has issued a statement promising to rebuild relations with Indigenous peoples in Canada and run an open, ethical and transparent government. While previous governments may not have paid this group of people much attention, the Trudeau government is committed to righting the wrongs done to Canada's indigenous peoples in the past."
 CAN_investigate_missing_indigenous_women:0 "Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women"
 CAN_investigate_missing_indigenous_women_desc:0 "The grim patter of Native American women being abducted has long plagued the many aboriginal communities within Canada. An issue previously ignored, the Trudeau government has announced a special inquiry into this dark phenomenon, which will hopefully find the root causes and come up with a solution."
 CAN_accepting_refugees:0 "Conditional Refugee Integration"
 CAN_accepting_refugees_desc:0 "We need every able-bodied man and woman we can get for the coming struggle against Soviet Communism. While Canada historically has had a scarce populace drawn from to fight conflicts, the terror across from our Southern Border has provided Canada with a constant stream of recruitable population for future conflicts. Trudeau, both compassionate and realistic, has embarked on a program which will provide the young and vulnerable a pathway to integration in Canadian Society, and the military-ready Canadian Citizenship in exchange for mandatory military service. After all, Service Guarantees Citizenship."
 CAN_concede_to_centrists:0 "Concede to the Establishment"
 CAN_concede_to_centrists_desc:0 "We have to be realistic about our ambitions; while Trudeau is a great reformer, he is also a realist who acknowledges where our party base lies. The Liberal Party is a party of the center, committed to moderate ideals through and through. We shouldn't anger our base by implementing radical socialist or ultra-liberal policies."
 CAN_like_my_father_before_me:0 "Like My Father Before Me"
 CAN_like_my_father_before_me_desc:0 "Justin Trudeau is like his father in many ways, both in the sense that he's a Liberal Prime Minister, and in the sense that he is a tireless reformer dedicated to radically shaping the Canadian political scene or die trying. With that in mind, Trudeau has announced that the wills of liberal-conservatives and pragmatists within the party will not hold him back, and that changes that could best be described as 'radical' are coming to Canada in the near future. This rapid shift, while alienating many Liberal voters, would secure any potential NDP support for the Liberal Government."
 CAN_trudeaumania:0 "Trudeaumania"
 CAN_trudeaumania_desc:0 "Trudeaumania was a term used to describe the excitement generated by Pierre Trudeau during his first few terms as Prime Minister. While the days of the original 'Trudeaumania' are long behind us, the younger Trudeau's allure has captured the nation once more, as the people of Canada fawn over their charismatic new leader. Like the Trudeaumania of old, this general feeling is likely to fade, but for now, Justin Trudeau can bask in leadership of a nation dazzled by his charm and good looks."
 CAN_tax_increases_on_the_rich:0 "Tax Increases on the Rich"
 CAN_tax_increases_on_the_rich_desc:0 "The laissez-faire economic policies of the previous Conservative government has allowed big business to rake in record profits, while providing little return for the rest of Canada. It shall be our legislative priority to lower taxes for middle-income Canadians and raise taxes for the top one percent of income earners. This shall allow the common people to breathe easier, and provide funds for the government by requisitioning funds from the upper classes."
 CAN_expand_the_trans_mountain_pipelines:0 "Expand the Trans-Mountain Pipeline"
 CAN_expand_the_trans_mountain_pipelines_desc:0 "Oil is a big moneymaker for the Canadian nation; and despite its controversy with some more environmentally minded cabinet members, it's a commodity of invaluable importance to the Trudeau government. To help get our oil to foreign markets, we shall construct new Oil Pipelines, allowing the safe transport of oil from its source to distribution networks, where it can be made ready for sale."
 CAN_deficits_for_infrastructure:0 "Deficits for Infrastructure"
 CAN_deficits_for_infrastructure_desc:0 "Pencil-pushers and bean counters are unconcerned with the welfare of common Canadians, and too concerned with numbers on spreadsheets.

 CAN_lavlin_bobardier_deals_desc:0 "SNC-Lavalin is a domestic Canadian company specializing in construction; one of the few in Canada not connected to the American Emigrés. As a domestic Canadian company with a sizable market share, we shall help them stay afloat in the cutthroat world of Canadian business; either by bailing them out, awarding them favorable contracts, or intervening in possible legal matters. While some may denounce this as corrupt, we realize it's a necessary evil to keep Canadian business afloat."
 CAN_self_balancing_budget:0 "A Self-Balancing Budget"
 CAN_self_balancing_budget_desc:0 "In a perfect world, government expenditures would not exceed government income no matter how the government chooses to spend its money.

 CAN_national_child_care_program_desc:0 "We shall announce the creation of a national child care plan with the intention of reducing day care fees for parents down to $10 a day per child within five years.

 CAN_enhance_the_cpp:0 "Enhance the CPP"
 CAN_enhance_the_cpp_desc:0 "Trudeau's government shall move to enhance the Canada Pension Plan and provide working Canadians with more income in retirement. These changes has been principally motivated by the declining share of the workforce that was covered by an employer defined-benefit pension plan. To finance the expanded pensions and maintain the soundness of the plan, contributions to the CPP from workers and their employers will each rise 1% from current levels."
 CAN_carbon_tax:0 "The Carbon Tax"
 CAN_carbon_tax_desc:0 "Canada, as a large and influential nation, must define itself as a world leader in the matters of climate change. Decisive action must be taken to guard our fragile ecosystem, even if that means Canadians pay over a little bit more. Canada shall put into practice a 'Carbon Tax', a system which puts a price on all greenhouse gasses that play a significant role in trapping heat in the atmosphere."
 CAN_strategic_innovation_fund:0 "Strategic Innovation Fund" 
 CAN_strategic_innovation_fund_desc:0 "The Canadian innovation ecosystem has long gone stale, pushed out of the limelight by the constant stream of American Emigrés and their deep pockets. To this end, the Trudeau government has announced the creation of the SIF, a program which will provide funding to innovative sectors, in the process creating a simpler, more flexible tool to Grow Canada’s Economy."

 CAN_bloc_quebecios_victory:0 "Triumph of the Bloc"
 CAN_bloc_quebecios_victory_desc:0 "The Bloc Québécois has achieved victory in the 2015 Federal Election... somehow? This shocking result has come about as a result of the BQ's unprecedented success and a complete failure of the remaining political establishment; something which has given the Bloc enough seats to form a minority government. As the dust settles, Canada's newfound ruling party must decide what their path forward will be, and what will come out of this extraordinary situation."
 CAN_quebec_issues_first:0 "Put Quebec Issues First"
 CAN_quebec_issues_first_desc:0 "The Bloc is unapologetically a party dedicated to Quebec issues, tabling issues important to Quebec exclusively. Now that the Bloc has gained a stunning Federal mandate, they can ensure that Quebec's issues are looked after, and that issues important to Francophone Canadians are put first and foremost."
 CAN_democratie_sociale:0 "Social-Démocratie"
 CAN_democratie_sociale_desc:0 "In addition to advocating for Quebec issues, the Bloc is also a party which holds roots in Social-Democratic and Democratic Socialist movement both within Quebec and across Canada. While the NDP has held most of Canada's Labour-Left votes, the Bloc and the NDP have differed, of course, in the fact that the BQ is a Quebec regional party. Now that we are Canada's governing party, we can help sway the left-leaning vote, and continue our advocating for a true Canadian-Québécois Social Democracy."
 CAN_le_un_terme:0 "Le Seul Terme"
 CAN_le_un_terme_desc:0 "It is obvious that the Bloc's victory in 2015 was nothing more than a freak twist of fate, and one that is not likely to be repeated any time soon.

 CAN_establish_lasting_connections:0 "Establish Lasting Connections"
 CAN_establish_lasting_connections_desc:0 "The unprecedented victory of the Bloc has telegraphed to all major parties that the will of Quebec is nothing to ignore. Now, practically every major party can not stop pandering to the Quebec vote, and has scrambled to ensure the potential loyalty of the Bloc in a minority government situation. This has untold benefits for the BQ and Quebec, as we can reliably extort the establishment for political influence."
 CAN_rethink_our_independence_positions:0 "Rethinking our Independence Position"
 CAN_rethink_our_independence_positions_desc:0 "The victory of the Bloc has invariably shattered the current paradigm of Canadian politics in regards to Quebec. The fact that the entire Canadian establishment is in a rush to pander to French-Canadians has allowed Quebec to gain untold influence within Canada, influence which has paved the foundation for a more equal Canada. Now that Anglo and Francophone Canadians are on more equal terms, many have begun to question the merits of potential Québécois independence, and our party's already unclear stance on the issue."
 CAN_bloc_rebranding:0 "Rebrand the Bloc"
 CAN_bloc_rebranding_desc:0 "The shock victory of the Bloc on a federal level has made many question the merits of the BQ as a purely regional party. Our success in 2015 has proven that we can be more than simply a party advocating for Quebec issues, and can spread out to aid all Canadians. Thus, the Bloc shall move away from its policy of Quebec regionalism, and will shift to being a major party in its own right, and run candidates outside of Quebec."

 CAN_new_political_force_desc:0 "The Bloc has spread its wings, and has broken out from being a purely Quebec based party to a party which can represent all Canadians; regardless of language.

 CAN_nationwide_secularism_law:0 "Nationwide Secularism Law"
 CAN_nationwide_secularism_law_desc:0 "One notable issue pushed by the Bloc and the Québécois government is the so-called 'Secularism Law', which prohibits certain Federal employees from wearing Religious items. This focus on secularism dates back to the so-called 'Quiet Revolution', where Quebec Citizens broke from the heavily Catholic traditions of the Dupleiss Government, and instituted strictly secular policies. Now, the Bloc will expand these policies to cover all of Canada, and end the corrosive influence of theism on Federal employees."
 CAN_bloc_liberal_coalition:0 "Secure Liberal Backing"
 CAN_bloc_liberal_coalition_desc:0 "The Liberals have agreed to support the Bloc Québécois in their bid for power, providing the new government with enough confidence to survive a second election.

 CAN_bloc_ndp_coalition_desc:0 "Our closest ideological counterparts, the New Democratic Party is a Canada-wide Democratic Socialist/Social Democratic party which has previously appropriated much of Quebec's left-leaning vote.

 CAN_anti_undercutting_measures:0 "Prevent Political Undercutting"
 CAN_anti_undercutting_measures_desc:0 "The competition between the NDP and Bloc has undercut the efforts of left-wing movements within Quebec. While previously the NDP has far surpassed, now that the Bloc has gained the upper hand, the NDP has signaled more openness to cooperation with the Bloc. From now on, we shall study the numbers, and avoid running candidates in overly-competitive seats where running both NDP and Bloc candidates would be detrimental."

 CAN_canadian_alliance_victory_desc:0 "Shockingly, the right-wing Canadian Alliance has outpaced their counterparts in the Progressive Conservatives, and has secured their hold with a narrow minority government. This unexpectedness of this result has shocked both Canada and the world, and has sent a brick through the Canadian political Establishment. The Canadian Alliance, while ecstatic at their long-shot victory, also holds their secret terror at the prospect of actual government instead of sideline heckling."

Behind him is a slim minority government hindered at every step by a loose-knit coalition of establishment parties who have threatened the Cruz premiership at every turn.

As we are hounded by the soulless sycophants and career politicians who want nothing more than to keep the average Canadian down at every turn, we must turn to extraordinary means.

Thus, Cruz has vanished, seemingly from the face of the earth in the moment when his party needed him most. In his place rises Jason Kenney, a former PC loyalist who defected to the Canadian Alliance after the collapse of the ProgCon poll numbers.

This time, of course, the Canadian Alliance has actually managed to edge out a win instead of eternally sitting in opposition. Some have called for a second merger, this time on our terms, while others favor the Canadian Alliance remaining as an independent right-wing force, much like the NDP is to the Liberals."

His goal was to free Canada from the woes of the Monarchy and British Tyranny, and to inspire Canadians to throw off their chains. Unlike the revolution South of the Border, this movement never took off, being relegated to nothing more than a footnote in Canadian history... until now. Mackenzie may be gone, but the Republic he fought for will now always live on."

 CAN_adress_quebec_soverignty_desc:0 "While the Quebec Separatist movement turned out to be mostly a flash in the pan, we can not deny the fact that the issue of Quebec's status still weighs heavily on the Canadian political scene.

 CAN_denounce_false_liberalism:0 "Denounce False Liberalism"
 CAN_denounce_false_liberalism_desc:0 "The fall of the United States has proven beyond a doubt the failure of Neoliberal policies.

 CAN_nationalization:0 "Nationalize Essential Industries"
 CAN_nationalization_desc:0 "Pierre Trudeau's attempts at nationalizing the Alberta Oil Industry was behind much of the divide our nation faces today.

 CAN_citizen_soldier_franchise:0 "Citizen-Soldier Franchise"
 CAN_citizen_soldier_franchise_desc:0 "No longer shall the democratic process be polluted by those disloyal to this country. Enlisting in the army has proven to the Prime Minister that the only citizens who are fit to decide the fate of the nation are those who have shed blood to defend it."
 CAN_distribute_rifles:0 "Distribution of Rifles"
 CAN_distribute_rifles_desc:0 "The war with the Commonwealth has shattered many delusions about Canadian safety.

 CAN_purge_the_rot_desc:0 "The red scare which swept the nation during the outbreak of war led to great gains by Reactionary and Reform-inspired movements.

 CAN_puppet_the_pcs:0 "Puppet the PCs"
 CAN_puppet_the_pcs_desc:0 "We love Democracy. The Democratic Process is vital to the Canadian way of life, and while the Prime Minister has made drastic alterations to the Canadian legislative system, he has no intention of allowing Canada to fall into the crutches of authoritarianism. The Progressive Conservatives, while labeled as 'Controlled Opposition' by some, are our most natural opposition party and free to speak their minds on a great variety of hot-button issues."
 CAN_catholic_heritage:0 "Catholic Heritage"

 CAN_managed_democracy:0 "Managed Democracy"
 CAN_managed_democracy_desc:0 "While a healthy democracy can be good for a nation, allowing those who wish to destroy our nation to run in elections will lead to nothing but ruin and national decay.

Previous campaigns have proven ineffective at stamping out these groups, and after a great deal of argument within the military brass, Prime Minister Trudeau has authorized the terror bombing of certain separatist strongholds within the Dark Provinces.

 CAN_focus_on_commonwealth_failures_desc:0 "The United States of America was undeniably a failed state, however instead of focusing on the disaster that was the USA without the King's guidance, instead we shall shift blame onto the Commonwealth.

Donald John Trump, who faked his death until such a time when the Illuminati can be vanquished, is the true heir to the Davidic Line. Furthermore, this illusive record also proves beyond a doubt that the British Israelite theory is correct, and that the true British Royal Family is heir to the Davidic throne. With this knowledge, we now know that Canada and Britain are the modern-day heirs to the Tribe of Ephraim and the Tribe of Manasseh.

The falling favour of Calvary has given rise to the new era's mechanical steads, which have come to dominate the battlefield of today and will continue to dominate the battlefield of the future. Despite this, Canada's armored corps are lacking in funding and resources, mostly due to the loss of our suppliers for our main tanks as the Leopard 2 to Communist regimes. The Military, ever concerned about this dilemma, has authorized the purchasing of older M-1 Abrams tanks from the American Breakaways, as well as the design and production of a wholly Canadian model which will take the best from both the Leopard and the Abrams."

 rw_canada.1.t:0 "The New Leader of the Free World"
 rw_canada.1.d:0 "Canada was once a backbencher in the realm of global politics, a second rate middle power subservient to the United States in every way. While we were content with our place, everything would change following the collapse of the United States in 1987. America's fall shook the roots of our foreign and domestic policy to its core; and as the remains of what was once America convulsed, a near-endless stream of desperate Americans heading towards Canada's borders. And if things couldn't get worse, the rest of our NATO allies either refused the call to protect Global Democracy, or themselves fell to the ravenous Communists.\n\n 20 years later, Canada is left as one of the world's last democracies, stranded along with the other shards of freedom in this Red World. Heralding what's left of NATO, Canada fights a seemingly hopeless fight against Soviet Hegemony; determined above all to avenge their fallen brothers to the South and restore freedom's bright gleam to a world darkened by Communism."
 rw_canada.1.o1:0 "For the True North!"
 
 rw_canada.2.t:0 "The Delicate Balance"
 rw_canada.2.d:0 "It would come as quite the shock to many that Preston Manning, once the sworn enemy of the out-of-touch Progressive Conservatives, would eventually come to lead them. The ProgCons today are the main force representing Canada's right, however this was not always the case. During the 1990s it seemed apparent that the Progressive Conservatives were doomed, condemned to irrelevance by their Western Canada oriented opposition in the Reform Party. While they managed to fend off irrelevance by cooperating with the Liberals, the Reform Party consistently managed to outshine the PCs in every area. However this trajectory would not remain, as the PCs would find themselves rebounding in the mid 2000s. In the wake of the PC resurgence, and the growing calls for a united Canadian Conservative Party in the form of the 'Unite the Right' movement, Preston Manning, once a staunch opponent of the PCs, agreed to dissolve the Reform Party and endure the ProgCons.\n\n This decision however was not universal, as vast swaths of the Reform Party continued to act as an independent entity, and found a new leader in the form of Stephen Harper, who denounced both Manning and his populist direction. While the Reform Party is broadly cooperative towards the Progressive Conservatives, their increasing bend towards defiance has many PC insiders worried. With Manning now Prime Minister, there are many who guess that a formal merger between the two parties may soon be in order. All that's needed to get things in motion is a catalyst..."

 rw_canada.3.t:0 "The New Decade's Economic Report"
 rw_canada.3.d:0 "The wake of the USA's collapse had catastrophic effects on Canada's economy, to say the least. While the loss of billions of dollars in commerce came as no surprise, what did come as a somewhat pleasant surprise was the relocation of American finance and business to the Great White North. The loss of many major trade hubs and centers of Commerce sent American money flocking. The obvious place to set up shop was Canada's, a nation in close proximity which possessed relative isolation from Communist threats. Additionally, Canada shared much of the same linguistic and cultural infrastructure of the old United States, allowing the 'emigrés' to adapt quickly to their new lives in Canada. 20 years later, Canada's economy has flourished, allowing Canada to establish itself as the unquestioned center of Global Commerce. With the Soviets stagnating and the Chinese struggling to break into international markets, Canada can safely boast about having the world's strongest economy. While there have undoubtedly been downsides to this arrangement with American Business, namely appalling corruption, Canada can thrive as an international hub of prosperity and economic safety. From Vancouver to Montreal, from Halifax to Calgary, Canada's business is business."

 rw_canada.4.t:0 "The Resignation of Senator Donald Trump"
 rw_canada.4.d:0 "Prominent Businessman and former member of the Toronto City Council, Donald Trump has officially tendered his resignation from the Senate of Canada. An influential figure within the Canadian political scene, Trump has thus far been content managing his many enterprises and quietly supporting the Progressive Conservatives. Despite being a personal friend of Pierre Trudeau near the end of his life, Trump has remained a strong supporter of the Progressive Conservatives; often providing them with generous donations of campaign funds. After a brief stint on the Toronto City Council, and a failed run for Mayor of Toronto in 2000, Trump has sought to remain quiet in the realm of politics, and since has only accepted a nomination to the generally apolitical Canadian Senate.\n\n Trump's appointment caused a small controversy, as some accused the PCs of appointing Trump due to his lofty contributions to the Conservative campaign. However, Prime Minister Manning maintained that Trump was appointed due to his business expertise, and as a reward for his embrace of Canadian values and decades of service to the Canadian Economy. The resignation of Senator Trump to many is a sign that Trump is back at it again, and is moving to become more involved in the Canadian political scene. Prominent whispers surrounding Trump have pointed to a possible Parliamentary run, most likely as the shoo-in candidate next election for Etobicoke Centre, one of the few seats in the Greater Toronto Area that the PCs have a realistic possibility of flipping. However some belive that Trump's ambitions may extend beyond the House of Commons, perhaps even putting himself up as a candidate to replace Manning as PC Leader and Prime Minister."

 rw_canada.5.t:0 "Rep. Cruz Causing Trouble"
 rw_canada.5.d:0 "The Member of Parliament for Calgary Nose Hill, Rafael Edward Cruz has made the papers today for a string of comments made regarding the Reform Party's relationship with the Progressive Conservatives. The Reform Party, while on paper an independent political entity, is heavily aligned with the PCs and are known to collaborate with them on several hot-button legislative issues. This de-facto coalition is a particularly contentious issue for Cruz, who has denounced both the PCs and any attempts by the Reform Party to work with them. According to Cruz, the Progressive Conservatives have sold out the core tenets of Conservatism, and have increasingly given way to psuedo-Socialist and proto-Liberal politics, and are no longer reliable as a right-wing party. Additionally, Cruz has rejected the concept of 'Strategic Voting', stating that a NDP or Liberal Victory would be preferable to a PC one because the Liberals and NDP are at least 'Honest about their intentions'.\n\n This increasing pattern of Reform disloyalty is a large contributing factor to the increasingly grim forecast for our next by-elections, as Reform candidates often attack Conservatives more than they attack their left-wing opponents."

 rw_canada.6.d:0 "Leader of the renegade arm of the Reform Party, Stephen Harper, has today met with his compatriot in the Progressive Conservative Party, Preston Manning. Manning and Harper have a long and storied history together, starting when they were both members of the old Reform Party, and ending when Manning dissolved the party to rejoin the PCs. Ever since, relations between Harper and Manning have been strained, with Harper often lending confidence to the PC Government in exchange for certain political concessions. However, this situation seems to be gearing up for a change, as Manning and Harper have begun moving to formally end the PC-Reform divide, and bring the mutinous faction back into the PC fold. Whether Manning will succeed in this endeavor is anyone's guess; but for now, it seems as if Harper is in agreement with Manning's conclusions."

 rw_canada.7.t:0 "The Reform Party to Merge with the Progressive Conservatives"
 rw_canada.7.d:0 "In a significant turn of events in Canadian politics, the Reform Party of Canada has recently announced its decision to merge with the Progressive Conservatives. This move, aimed at consolidating conservative strength and influence in the current political climate, represents a major shift in the country's political dynamics. Leaders from both parties have emphasized the need for unity to present a robust challenge to the Liberals and the NDP, acknowledging that a fragmented conservative front has diminished their collective impact in recent elections. This strategic fusion, while widely supported by those advocating for a stronger opposition, has also stirred debate among party members concerned about preserving their distinct ideologies and policies. This merger marks a crucial moment in Canadian politics, heralding a potential reshaping of the national political landscape and indicating the onset of a new chapter in the country's political narrative."
 rw_canada.7.o1:0 "To a United Party!"

 rw_canada.8.t:0 "Cruz Denounces the Merger"
 rw_canada.8.d:0 "Rafael Edward Cruz, the Member of Parliament for Calgary Nose Hill, has emerged as a vocal critic of the recent merger between the Reform Party and the Progressive Conservatives. This union, aimed at consolidating conservative forces within Canadian politics, has sparked intense debate across the political spectrum. Cruz, known for his staunch advocacy for core Reform Party principles, views this merger as a dilution of the party's foundational values. He articulates his concerns with a fervor that resonates with many party loyalists, arguing that the merger compromises the distinct identity and ideological purity that the Reform Party has long championed. His denunciation is not just a critique of the merger but an impassioned plea for the preservation of the party's unique political legacy.\n\n In public forums and the halls of Parliament, Cruz has been forthright in expressing his disapproval, warning that this blending of parties risks alienating the grassroots supporters who have been the backbone of the Reform Party's strength. He contends that the merger represents a capitulation to political expediency over principle, a move that could erode the trust and support of the party's base. Despite facing opposition from those in favor of the merger, Cruz's stance has struck a chord with a significant faction within the party, igniting a robust internal debate about the future direction of conservative politics in Canada. His position underscores a deep-seated tension within the party, reflecting the broader challenges of balancing ideological integrity with the pragmatic demands of political unification."

 rw_canada.9.t:0 "Cruz Founds Own Party"
 rw_canada.9.d:0 "The ultimate goal of the one-man backbench revolt manned by one Rafael Edward Cruz (better known as 'Ralph Cruz' to some), has been revealed. Cruz, along with a handful of particularly rabid Reform loyalists, have officially moved to leave the Progressive Conservative caucus, and form their own party dedicated to the ideals espoused by the former Reform Party. This party, named the 'Canadian Alliance', is dedicated to Conservatism in both an economic and social sense, and has promised to undo the decades of Social Reform advanced under the Rae and Chrétien Governments. This party has been described as 'Fascistic' by some, and is without a doubt the most radical player on the organized Canadian political scene. While this party is unlikely to gain significant power any time soon, the exodus of several Conservative MPs to a new political player has many within the Progressive Conservatives particularly worried."

 rw_canada.10.t:0 "Poilievre Ramps up Attacks"
 rw_canada.10.d:0 "Pierre Poilievre is a newer addition to the cabinet of Preston Manning; only becoming a full-fledged PC after the absorption of the Reform Party. While a newer face, Poilievre has already made a name for himself as the Tories' designated 'Attack Dog'. Among the youngest MPs in Parliament, Poilievre's status as Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister has gained him widespread fame both within the PC caucus and across Canada. A fierce and uncompromising figure, Poilievre has already made his fair share of enemies through a series of gutsy attacks and public stunts, all aimed at riling up the PC base. Most notably, Poilievre has become a frequent critic of the way Canada conducts elections, and has proposed several changes to the way Canadians vote; mainly the elimination of the vouching system. The proposed addendums garnered opposition across both Canada and the world's remaining democracies, leading Poilievre to attack the chief electoral office of Elections Canada, stating that they want 'more power, a bigger budget and less accountability'.\n\n Poilievre, while strengthening the PC's image as a party not afraid to fight the good fight, has also garnered a significant amount of criticism for his more 'questionable' comments. In light of his status as both a blessing and a curse, many within the party have urged Manning to keep Poilievre on a tighter leash."

 rw_canada.14.t:0 "The Mulroney Legacy Enshrined"
 rw_canada.14.d:0 "The legacy of Brian Mulroney, 18th Prime Minister of Canada has been a complicated one. In some ways, Mulroney's legacy is one bitter failure. Seeing the PCs through to their worst result in History, Mulroney had to bear the sting of losing his own seat, an unprecedented occurrence in Canadian politics. Despite this, the Manning Government has moved to rehabilitate his legacy; putting forward many of the shelved policies of the Mulroney Government which were proposed yet never implemented. Mulroney's dream of Canadian Trade Prowess, long overshadowed by humiliating failures of the Meech Lake Accord and later 1989 Federal Election, has become a hallmark of the modern ProgCon movement, who have moved to open up trade with our shattered Southern neighbors. While we share little in common ideologically with most of the US remnants, we can not deny the potential benefits of establishing business relations with the American breakaways. Mulroney himself has been delighted by this new direction for the PCs, and has offered his full-throated support to Prime Minister Manning; even if he encouraged Manning to move towards more moderate Conservative stances in the same breath. Indeed, it seems that Mulroney has lived to see more of his policies implemented in retirement than he did while he was Prime Minister."

 rw_canada.15.d:0 "Donald Trump, an influential Toronto real-estate developer, former Senator, and prominent donor to the PC campaign, has recently made the papers for his vocal opposition to Prime Minister Manning's new pro-Free Trade policies. According to Trump, the opening of Canada's markets to foreign goods threatens the Canadian economy and puts Canada's already fragile job market at risk. Trump has instead come out strongly in favour of protectionist policies which would defend domestic business against foreign competition with a system of high tariffs.\n\n This vocal attack has once more put Donald Trump in the spotlight. Trump himself, while quite comfortable in the PC caucus, has been more and more vocal about his distrust of Manning's new direction and association with the Reform Party. Indeed, Trump has frequently attacked the Reform Party's on many issues, particularly Stephen Harper's approach to Social Conservatism. Trump fancies himself as something of an Economic Conservative with Liberal social attitudes, a stance which has not sat well with much of PC's new Prairie-based electorate. This clash between the Ontario real-estate mogul and the Prime Minister is one more furthering of the already strenuous regional divide within the PC party."

On the Provincial level, the Fords are the main Conservative opposition to Liberal Premier Dalton McGuinty, as well as on the Municipal level, where Liberals such as Joe Pantalone and David Miller still hold influence over Toronto Politics.

 rw_canada.39.d:0 "Trump's ascension as Prime Minister of Canada has shattered the typical paradigm of Canadian politics, and has put an unpredictable Emigré squarely in charge of our nation's decision-making for the next four years. Donald Trump, while a fierce campaigner, was seemingly not prepared to actually win the Prime Ministerial race, as his campaign focused solely on flashy economic promises and anti-Migrant rhetoric. Now that he has won, it has become clear that Trump is not used to his duty as Prime Minister. The proverbial dog has caught the car, and now Trump has sought to carve out his place in Canadian History, even if he isn't entirely sure how. Trump, an Emigré who seems to think that the role of Canadian Prime Minister is interchangeable with the role of President of the United States, has met a harsh reckoning with the duties and limits of the Canadian PM. Even as a MP, Trump has been expelled from the House of Commons numerous times for 'Unparliamentary Language', further cementing the divide between the inexperienced Prime Minister and the rest of the House of Commons. Shouting matches in Parliament between the Prime Minister and other MPs has become a hallmark of the Trump Premiership, as Trump grapples with the differences between campaign trail popularity contests and day-to-day governance.\n\n As the rift between Trump and the House Speaker grows, Trump has been more and more vocal about his stance that the Prime Minister should not be beholden to such petty restrictions, and that for Canada to truly establish itself as a world power, the PM's role needs be more in line with the old President of the United States."

Considering the ultimate fate of the United States, a great many have encouraged Trump to exercise caution in this matter, lest the Canadian Citizenry view this as a power-grab, or worse an attempt to erode Canada's distinct identity. Challenging this proposal is Maxime Bernier, one of the few Reformites on good terms with the Prime Minister. Bernier's solution to Trump's conflict with Parliament is a novel one, and would see Trump resign from his position as MP and return to the Senate to rule. A Canadian Prime Minister serving from the Senate, while a rare occurrence, is not unheard of, as both Mackenzie Bowell and John Abbott have done so. While the Prime Minister appointing himself to a Senate seat would be a legally complex matter, in theory such an action would be possible. Trump resigning from the House of Commons to serve in the Senate would solve much of his conflict with other MPs, however would most likely dissatisfy Trump's desire for greater authority."

While Trump can enjoy the unfettered support of his home city of Toronto, this partnership is nothing close to one-sided, as Trump has left the Ford Brothers with a glowing endorsement. With Trump's support under their belt, many predict that Doug Ford now holds the leverage necessary to take control of the Ontario Progressive Conservatives; putting him in a better position to challenge the Liberal Government of Dalton McGuinty.\n\n This open association, while alienating many within Western Canada, is a sign that the Trump Government can breathe a little bit easier now that they have the backing of the powerful Ford Political Machine behind them."

In an attempt to curry favour with Albertans, Trump paid a formal visit to the Albertan City of Calgary, a major hub of oil-driven Canadian Business in the West. Trump stated during his visit 'It is an absolute honor to be here today in Calgary, a city that is not just the pride of Alberta but a shining jewel in the great Canadian landscape. Calgary, you embody the true Canadian spirit – hardworking, resilient, and full of the pioneering drive that has made our country one of the greatest in the world. And let me tell you, just like I love seeing our beautiful nation prosper, I'm thrilled to be here in this fantastic city! Calgary, you are known worldwide for your dynamic energy sector, your breathtaking natural beauty, and, of course, the unforgettable Calgary Stampede. It's this kind of vibrant community and cultural richness that makes Canada the envy of the world. Now, as Prime Minister, I've always believed in the power of energy to drive our economy forward. And right here in Calgary, you're leading the way. You know how to develop energy, how to innovate, and how to do it responsibly. This is the kind of forward-thinking leadership that not only powers an economy but paves the way for a future that benefits all Canadians.'\n\n This formal visit from the Prime Minister has been described as a resounding success for Trump's popularity in Western Canada, with polls showing a sizeable shift in opinion, and a probable surge in support for the PCs. At the end of his trip to Calgary, Trump was gifted his own Stetson hat by the organizers of the Calgary Stampede, and was graciously invited to return to the city next year to enjoy the festivities."

While we are no friend to the Commonwealth, we can not deny the fact that millions of dollars of trade revenue are generated by trade between our nations.\n\n Trump, ever the protectionist, has attempted to change this in the construction of the wall, and has even gone so far as to suggest tearing down the famed Ambassador Bridge, a hub of Canadian-American Commerce and the site of the first wave of Refugees crossing into Canada."

Compromise is an art as old as politics itself, and Layton has recognized this, and has opted to seek compromise with the various factions within the NDP.

Led by Mel Watkins and James Laxer, this faction within the NDP attempted in vain to change the face of the party on their terms, however after Waffle candidate James Laxer was defeated by David Lewis, many New-Left loyalists quit the NDP to found their own political movement. The 'Movement for an Independent Socialist Canada' was founded by Laxer and Watkins, and attempted unsuccessfully to run candidates on the Federal Level. By the late 80's many of the Waffle's leaders had returned to the NDP, taking up important positions and shaping the policy of the party in the late 20th century. The second 'Waffle Exodus' occurred after Bob Rae gained control of the NDP. Rae's policies in regards to Unions and the NDP left came under heavy scrutiny by Waffleites, who either stood behind Layton's backbench revolt, or resigned from the party altogether. With Rae firmly out of the picture, Layton has formally made amends with the former leaders of the Waffle: James Laxer and Mel Watkins. Layton's courting of these two figures is seen by many as a sign that the NDP is going beyond the Broadbent-era Social Democracy, and returning to their roots as a Democratic Socialist party.

As someone who has previously been the subject of health concerns, Layton's closest advisors have gone to great lengths to keep Canada's best doctors on standby in case the worst comes to pass. And thanks to Layton's own healthcare reforms, Canada is renowned for having among the best and more skilled doctors in the world, helping to battle his existing form of prostate cancer. Unfortunately, it seems that the worst has indeed come to pass. The Prime Minister's personal doctor has confirmed the grim news: Layton is now fighting a second bout of cancer. The new cancer diagnosis, identified to be either Metastasis or lymphoma, will require immediate treatment. While as both Prime Minister, and a strong reformer of Canada's healthcare system, Layton is entitled to top-notch medical care, there is a growing sense of worry both within the NDP and the rest of the government that Layton's cancer may be more serious than first thought."

Feeling he has a duty to address the concerns of the people, Prime Minister Layton has finally made news of his diagnosis public, stating that he would be temporarily stepping back from his duties as Prime Minister to focus on his recovery. During his address, Layton noted that his father, Robert Layton, also suffered from cancer 17 years before and recovered from it, raising optimism that Layton may be back on his feet soon. Despite this, the fact that Layton left out the nature of his newly-diagnosed cancer during his speech is a sign to many that the prognosis may be grim.

The timeline and structure of this process has received both praise and criticism; with observers lodging complaints about a perceived lack of transparency. The final report of the inquiry has concluded that the high level of violence directed at FNIM women and girls is 'caused by state actions and inactions rooted in colonialism and colonial ideologies.' It also concluded that the crisis constituted an ongoing "race, identity and gender-based genocide.'\n\n Furthermore, the committee has stated that 'Throughout this report, and as witnesses shared, we convey truths about state actions and inactions rooted in colonialism and colonial ideologies, built on the presumption of superiority, and utilized to maintain power and control over the land and the people by oppression and, in many cases, by eliminating them.'"

Ignatieff's father, Count George Pavlovich Ignatieff was a White Russian Emigré who served as Chancellor of the University of Toronto and a diplomat for the Trudeau and Pearson Governments. George was the youngest of five sons, to a distinguished Russian noble family. Hisz mother was Princess Natalia Nikolayevna Meshcherskaya and his father was Count Pavel Ignatiev, a close advisor to Tsar Nicholas II serving as his last Minister of Education.  Following the Russian Revolution, Count Ignatieff was imprisoned, but his release was negotiated by sympathetic supporters. The family fled to France, and later moved to Canada. Michael Ignatieff would be the first of his family never to see his family's ancestral homeland of Russia; being at the other side of a bitter cold war with Russia's Soviet occupiers.\n\n With our conflict with Russia over, and Canada on the winning side, Michael Ignatieff is free once more to make a pilgrimage to his family's home."

 rw_canada.91.d:0 "In a significant move signaling a shift in the political winds, Prime Minister Michael Ignatieff recently held a noteworthy meeting with former Prime Minister Paul Martin, an event that has sparked widespread discourse within the Canadian Liberal Party. This meeting, emblematic of the party's gradual drift towards more center-right policies, marks a pivotal moment in its ideological trajectory. Michael Ignatieff, a figure who has been at the forefront of this subtle yet discernible shift, engaged in extensive discussions with Martin, whose tenure as Prime Minister was characterized by fiscally conservative policies that left an indelible mark on the party's economic approach. This rendezvous between past and present leadership is seen as a confluence of ideas aimed at redefining the Liberal Party’s stance, particularly in areas of economic management and social policy.\n\n The convergence of Ignatieff's contemporary vision with Martin's legacy is indicative of the party's adaptation to the changing political landscape of Canada. Under Ignatieff's guidance, the Liberals are increasingly embracing policies that lean towards fiscal prudence, balanced budgets, and market-friendly strategies, a departure from their traditionally more centrist, if not center-left, positioning. This ideological realignment, while drawing some criticism from the party's traditional base, is also seen as a strategic move to capture a broader electorate, particularly in the face of rising challenges from both the left and the right of the political spectrum. The meeting between Ignatieff and Martin, thus, is not just a mere gathering of party luminaries but a symbol of the Liberal Party's evolving ethos, reflecting a pragmatic approach to governance and policy-making in the complex and ever-changing realm of Canadian politics."

Rae has stated that his decision to leave the NDP was driven by the party's leftward direction, and was a result of the increasing conflict with Layton's branch of the party. Openly expressing reserved disgruntlement until the final moment, the NDP has now been left in a state of disarray, as countless more 'moderate' NDP voters also join Rae's exodus. While the NDP has stated that Rae's leaving was a mutual decision, in secret the defection of Rae was years in the making, with a common remark within the NDP being that Rae would have joined the Liberals long ago if their poll numbers were better. Rae's break with the NDP was made inevitable after Michael Ignatieff (Rae's former College Roommate) became Prime Minister; putting the Liberals back in the spotlight and firmly establishing the Liberals once more as the unquestioned force of Canada's center-left."

Rather, it has been a result of years of reckless social-liberalism driving right-leaning voters into the arms of the PCs. The Party under Ignatieff now seeks to remedy this, and give those on Canada's right a moderate alternative to the Progressive Conservatives. The Progressive Conservatives, while claiming to be a moderate party, have been rotted from the inside by radical Reform Party Loyalists, and are now nothing but a gaggle of ill-educated reactionaries. The Liberals, long scorned by Canada's right, will now embrace a steady form of Liberal Conservatism, which can hopefully allow them to appeal to both Left-Wing and Right-Wing voters.\n\n Of course, this direction is heavily frowned upon by Social Liberals within the party, who have been engaged in a backbench revolt as a result. Manning this revolt is Justin Trudeau, son of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, who has denounced Ignatieff's direction as betraying the Liberal brand and opening up the party to reactionary infiltration, damning the Liberals to the same fate which befell the PCs."

 rw_canada.94.d:0 "In a politically charged and symbolic meeting, Prime Minister Jean Chrétien sat down with his successor, Michael Ignatieff, in a gathering that has been widely interpreted as a nod towards the Canadian Liberal Party's shift to the left. This rendezvous, bringing together two pivotal figures of Canadian politics, underscores a significant ideological recalibration within the party. Chrétien, known for his charismatic leadership and centrist policies, engaged in profound discussions with Ignatieff, who himself had navigated the complexities of economic and social reforms during his tenure. This meeting represents a confluence of ideas, symbolizing the party's increasing inclination towards progressive policies and social welfare agendas.\n\nThe convergence of Chrétien's complicated legacy with Ignatieff's insights reflects the Liberal Party's response to the evolving demands of Canadian society. Under Chrétien's influence, the Liberals appear to be embracing a more socially conscious approach, prioritizing healthcare, environmental stewardship, and inclusive social policies. This shift is seen as an attempt to realign the party with the needs and aspirations of a broader demographic, particularly younger voters and those concerned with social justice issues. The engagement between these two leaders, with their rich history in the party's evolution, is emblematic of the Liberals' commitment to progressive values. This move, while potentially alienating some of the party's more fiscally conservative supporters, is a strategic effort to reestablish the Liberals as a champion of left-leaning ideals, reflecting a renewed focus on addressing the challenges of inequality and climate change in the contemporary Canadian political landscape."

This position of openness both towards the NDP and Canada's left is a sign that Ignatieff has rejected the Liberal Party's right wing faction, and is attempting to appeal more to Left-Wing voters. This strategy has had some success, with many Rae supporters coming to the aid of the Liberals after becoming alienated with the NDP's leftward direction.\n\n This new direction of the party has had broad support within the higher echelons of the party, as many feel that the collapse of the party in the early 2000s was a result of the party's abandonment of their left-wing founding principles. Of course, there are still business oriented minds, mostly coalesced around former Prime Minister Paul Martin, who view this new direction as dangerous and liable to alienate those who seek an alternative to the Tories."

The NDP has denounced this bill as the first step towards the creation of a Canadian Police State, while the Conservatives have slammed this bill as an attempt to suppress Ignatieff's political enemies.

Following his death, a cascade of support has poured out from across the political spectrum, with friends, enemies, opponents and supporters all expressing their deep sadness over Layton's passing. Citizens from across the nation left flowers and cards at the eternal flame on Parliament Hill, where the flag on the peace tower was lowered to half-staff. Prime Minister [CAN.GetLeader], while facing off against Layton in recent elections, expressed their grief over his passing and organized a state funeral for the late Opposition Leader.\nFollowing Layton's death, his family released an open letter, written by Layton two days before his death. In the letter, he expressed his wishes regarding the NDP's leadership in the event of his death, and addressed various segments of the Canadian population.

The rise of the 'New Right' in the American Republic permanently put an end to the Reagan-era sensibilities shared by Conservative movements across the world. While this had catastrophic effects in those remaining democracies, in Canada, Conservative movements had never shared the same gusto as their Yankee counterparts. Indeed, Canada’s Conservatives faced the awful fate of being relegated to a watered-down 'Progressive Conservative' movement even before the USA’s untimely end. However, as the PCs fell apart and the Reform Party rose in its place, ideologues which could charitably be described as ‘NeoConservative’ have once more gained control of Canada's right. This NeoConservative resurgence in Canada has had an effect the world over, as the ideals of Harper and Manning have gained a variable monopoly on mainstream Conservative thought world wide. In a world of Communist dominance, Harper and Manning have prevailed as one of the few examples of successful Conservative resurgence, and have heralded themselves and Canada as an example which can be followed worldwide."

'Progressive' PCs like Joe Clark and Jean Charest have hailed this action as a true revival of the PC cause, and a motion that will end the increasingly unpopular domination of the party by Reformite ideals. The reaction to this decision by the voters is varied. On one hand, the famously moderate Canadian political scene has smiled on the PC's increasingly banal messaging, on the other, firebrands like Ralph Cruz have denounced this action as a betrayal of the Conservative cause. While Cruz has always been a thorn in [GetCanPCLeaderShortHand]'s side, there are still many Reform loyalists who are weary of the CA picking up alienated Reform voters, especially in the party's traditional heartland of Western Canada; something which could possibly lead to a repeat of the 2010 by-election fiasco.

The attachment to pro-independence ideals starkly divided the Bloc Québécois, and led to an almost 20-year slump in party popularity which we are only now recovering from. The fact that the BQ managed to win a majority of Quebec seats appeared to be as a result of the BQ's increasingly unclear stance on Quebec independence, with a broad shift occurring from 'Independence' to 'Autonomy'(even if particularly determined figures still push for Independence from the rest of Canada). Of course, since the BQ now has a powerful amount of sway in Canadian politics, the party has sought to ditch any such affiliations with independence movements and instead focus on using the Bloc's leverage as a bargaining chip to help the rest of the political establishment focus on Quebec issues."

With this new tonal shift, the Bloc has announced their intention to run candidates across Canada. This new attempt by the Bloc to break into the Anglophone political scene has mixed reactions. Most Canadians find the idea of the Bloc running candidates in English Canada as laughable, and analysts are skeptical about the Bloc's ability to win even a single seat outside of Quebec. Despite this, there is still a large voting base for this new 'Canadian Bloc' across the country, as a great deal of non-Francophone Canadians have commended the BQ's job at governing Canada.

Hope for Canada's working men and women rebounded during Ed Broadbent's first term, as the CLC-aligned NDP was finally given a shot at power after decades of Conservative and Liberal Dominance. Even if the damage done by the Mulroney government was not fully undone, Broadbent's social-democratic government worked tirelessly to give Canada's unions a second shot. Throughout losses in the later 90's, the NDP remained the bulward of organized labour's representation in Canadian politics. However, that all changed during the tenure of Bob Rae. Rae, out of either greed or a desire to appease right-leaning members of the Canadian establishment so happily threw away countless years of solidarity between the NDP and the CLC, and in the process doomed his own Premiership. Now that Layton and union-friendly leadership has regained control of the party, the NDP is now once more the party of the working man.

While the Liberals would eventually regain their hold on the left-leaning establishment, Broadbent's victory permanently solidified the NDP as a serious player in the Canadian political arena. Even after leaving power, Ed Broadbent has always been a firebrand and staunch supporter of 'Classical' NDP politics. This stance, while popular to much of the party's base, made him many enemies during the tenure of Bob Rae, where he, along with Jack Layton, led a backbench revolt against the 'New NDP', forcing Rae to compromise with the Liberal party to remain in power.

Indeed, much of the 'Waffle' base has begrudgingly accepted this trend, and have accepted that the days of the NDP being openly socialist are long gone.

From now on, the possession and recreational use of marijuana carries far less steep punishments; the 1923 prohibition of the drug has been almost entirely expunged, and the Criminal Code updated to account. The decriminalization of cannabis in Canada is a milestone for Canada, with Canada being one of the few nations on earth to begin the process. While the first steps towards legalization for recreational use have been, Marijuana is still regulated by the Provinces, allowing many discrepancies between varying jurisdictions, with each region expected to handle the decriminalization in their own way.\n\nWhile Stoners and Potheads in Canada have let out a cheer, others within the Party have denounced this new Cannabis friendly attitudes as a 'Capitulation to the Stoners', and have warned of Reefer Madness taking hold of the Canadian Populace.

However as Trump's term develops, so to does the ideology of Donald Trump and the community of increasinly bitter American emigrés residing in Canada. Coalescing in the form of 'Trumpism', Donald Trump's own unique political path has been described by many as an authoritarian and far-right movement. Long since abandoning his own moderate stances, Trump has fully leaned into the wills of this populist movement, and has repeatedly used the devotion of his followers to expand the powers of the Prime Minister. The Canadian Political scene, long known for its moderation and sensibility, has been completely caught off guard by Trump's movement, and has scrambled to muster a response to his populist rhetoric.

Trump's turn to populism, while representative of the Party's shift during the Manning era, has taken on a transformation of its own. Once seen as somewhat unorthodox soft-C Conservative who could end the domination of Reform loyalists, the policies of Prime Minister Trump have instead grown to reflect the wing of the party he once often attacked. Unlike figures such as Harper and Cruz, Trump is not a Western Canadian himself, however his brand of Populist rhetoric has appealed to the disparate communities of Western Canada who have so often felt alienated by the Government in Ottawa. Additionally, Trump's anti-establishment rhetoric has often appealed to the American emigré community, who see Trump as representative of the American nostalgia which has entranced them. This support from the American exile communist has persisted despite Trump's vocal attacks against immigrants from the Commonwealth and UAPR; this of course being doubly ironic considering Trump’s American heritage. This 'Trumpist' movement has often been compared to Peronism due to their mutual disregard for the contemporary political system, while others have drawn parallels between Trump and Mussolini due to their shared anti-democratic tendencies and egotistical personality. This growth of Neo-Nationalist sentiment after the victory of the Soviet Union appears to be part of a worldwide trend towards either illiberal democracy or outright dictatorship; and that not even Canada, once the beacon of the Free World, is safe from the trappings of authoritarianism."

Drawing from Trump's famed populist and anti-establishment rhetoric, combined with Trump's own charisma, supporters of Trump have grown more fanatic in recent years, and have increasingly become a thorn in the side of the remainder of the Canadian political scene. This phenomenon, while always present during Trump's tenure, has escalated to new heights in recent years, with Trump appearing to fully lean into these messianic conspiracy theories. The fanatic devotion by Trump's followers exhibit certain characteristics not uncommon within other authoritarian strongmen, leading many to come to the conclusion that a Cult of Personality is developing around Prime Minister Trump. Also common within the psyche of Trump supporters is a prevailing feeling of nostalgia; one of harkening back to the 'Good old Days'; before the collapse of the United States. These nostalgics wish to return to a 'Simpler' time, a time before the triumph of Communism worldwide and before the grips of political and social rot consumed the United States, and see Trump as just the man to make that happen. While these movements have an undeniable evangelical bend, the failure of Christian politics to take root in Canada has greatly dampened their ability to spread their ideals in such a fashion. Additionally, the most extreme 'Followers of the Red Hat' believe that Trump is something of a modern messiah figure, with several conspiracy theories revolving around him being spread by the Radio and Intranet.

That is why Cruz's recent announcement comes as such a shock. Amid Trump's radical reorganization towards right-leaning Reformite politics, much of the previously rebellious Canadian Alliance has won over Trump's support. This comes amid unprecedented discontent within the ProgCon 'Red Tory' wing which was previously loyal to Trump. This backbench revolt, manned by former Deputy Prime Minister Andrew Scheer, has crippled the Trump Cabinet's ability to conduct business, and has given the Canadian Alliance a crucial amount of leeway. However instead of simply bringing the CA into a supply-confidence agreement with the PCs, Trump has instead moved to absorb the party entirely; with Cruz remarking that the Progressive Conservatives have moved to 'Exemplify the spirit of the Reform Party' under Trump.

However, the emergence of Rafael Cruz's 'Canadian Alliance' would put any such optimism to rest. The PC-Reform Merger, once seen as the best opportunity for Reformites to exert their influence in a cohesive Conservative movement, is now seen as nothing more than spineless capitulation; the watering down of Canada's right by turncoats such as Preston Manning and Stephen Harper. The rise of the Alliance is now seen as a reaction to this, a dichotomy raised by the corruption of the out-of-touch PCs. As Jason Kenney rises as the new Prime Minister, Canada's right has finally been forced into a reckoning, and as the Progressive Conservatives fall from grace for seemingly the last time, the remainders of Canada's right look towards their new savior. Like Moses, Jason Kenney has led Canadian Conservatism from bondage by weak-willed progressives and scheming emigrés, has cast down false prophets such as Cruz along the way, and has brought our nation's right-wing to a promised land of populism and Christian values."

Their losses were so catostrophic that even Prime Minister Mulroney lost his own seat; an unprecedented occurence in the realm of Canadian Politics. There were many reasons why the PC party was wracked with such tremendous losses, from the sluggish economy, to the American Refugee Crisis, to the strength of the Broadbent campaign, to the instability felt due to the USA's coallapse, however none of these issues would have contributed to such an extreme loss had it not been for one variable: the Reform Party. Echoing the growing movement of Western Canadian fed up with being ignored, the Reform Party quickly grew to outpace their opponents in the PCs. However this momentum would not last, and soon the party's founder would disavow them in a bid to help the PCs. This betrayal is alive and well in the minds of the Canadian Alliance. Now that the events of 1989 have repeated, albeit on a smaller scale, many have proposed moving to absorb the remnants of the PC party. Due to the circumstances which lead to the CA arising, many are unsterstandably skeptical about the prospects of merging with the PCs. Others have agknowledged that the shoe is now on the other foot, and any movement to unify the Progressive Conservatives and Canadian Alliance would be on the CA's terms."

This move, aimed at consolidating Canada's right-wing, has taken effect today, and has led to the formal dissolution of the Progressive Conservatives as a political party. While they have rebounded from destruction once, it seems that luck has finally run out for the PCs. As of now, all sitting PC MPs will cross the floor to join the newly created 'United Conservative Party'. While this merge enjoys a large deal of support from center-right and right-wing voters, several PCs, most notably former Prime Minister Joe Clark, who equated this move to an 'Alliance take-over' and remarked that 'Some equate it to a death in the family. I regard it rather as a death of the family' continue to oppose this merger.

The PC's preservation as a 'Moderate' alternative to the Canadian Alliance is seen by many as a right-wing mirror of the situation between the Liberals and the NDP. Seeing the ideological gulf which exists between the more ideological Alliance and the more moderate Red Tory-influenced PC Party, as well as surveys that indicated many Tory voters would rather select the Liberals as their second choice than the Alliance, the PCs have opted to simply remain on the sidelines of the Kenney Government. Even now, polls indicate the PCs are polling at a similar level to the NDP and Liberals during their periods in opposition, indicating that there is still a large contingent of the Canadian Electorate which finds the Alliance's political positions to be unacceptable."

These bills, undeniably influences by Kenney's strong Christian Faith, seek to crackdown on 'immoral' behaviors and attitudes, and push back against the wave of Liberal social attitudes promoted by previous governments. Kenney himself, while notable for his anti-abortion stances, has notably not included any restrictions into his new package of laws, simply prohibiting the use of public money to fund abortion access. This position is both personal and pragmatic, as the polls indicate the Canadian electorate strongly supporting the continued legality of abortion.

However, Rafael Edward 'Ralph' Cruz is instead nowhere to be found. Cruz has both figuratively, and quite literally disappeared from the face of the Earth, as Cruz resigned both as a MP and as leader of the Canadian Alliance and seemingly vanished once it became clear that he was within a position to form government. Attempts to track down Cruz have undercovered a disturbing web of criminal activity, ranging from bribery, voter intimidation, and even crimes as serious as murder. While nothing is concrete, a trail of evidence has loosely tied Cruz to a series of gruesome murders in Calgary, which involved the seemingly random killing of a Calgarian auto mechanic and a substitute teacher visiting from Edmonton. The lack of clear motive and a cold trail, combined with a vast and wide-reaching conspiracy by Cruz's cronies to bury evidence has made it difficult to tie Cruz to any one of these crimes. Additionally, his unknown whereabouts makes prosecuting him difficult\n\n While many doubt that Cruz is involved with these murders, let alone the one who committed them due to their apparent lack of political relevance, those who have worked with Cruz have stated that they wouldn't discount the possibility of Cruz himself committing these crimes. Jason Kenney, Cruz's former ally and Political Successor, has scarcely mentioned Cruz, even in the light of the growing web of illegal activity surrounding him.

One such means is enlisting the help of veteran consultant, lobbyist and ally to the far-right, Roger Stone. Stone, along with key ally Paul Manafort, run a moderately sized lobbying firm out of Ottawa. Working closely with the former Republican party before the United States' collapse, Stone and Manafort today play a key role in supporting various authoritarian regimes across the planet. And now, Stone and Manafort have put their talents to work in propping up Rafael Edward Cruz' Alliance government. Putting millions of ill-earned dollars into a lobbying blitz across the nation, Stone and Manafort hope to either convince or threaten the disparate shreds of the Canadian Conservative movement into backing Cruz without saying they're backing Cruz, utilizing an infamous strategy defined by Stone as 'Admit nothing, deny everything, and launch a counterattack'. These brazen acts of political bullying appear to be doing the trick, as much of the Conservative electorate, out of either loyalty or fear, is beginning to side with Cruz. Of course, Cruz's alliance with Manafort could very well be a PR disaster in the making, as Manafort and by extension Stone have been linked to no shortage of less-than-legal activities. From propping up the Union of Lincoln, to lobbying for authoritarian regimes such as Pakistan, and helping to clean the image of leaders such as Ferdinand Marcos and Mobutu Sese Seko, Manafort's credentials in the world of dark money can not be diminished.

While we owe our existance as a nation to our loyalty throughout the conflict, Canada's long history standing side-by-side with the United States has given the American Revolution a certain reverence within the public conciousness. However with the outcome of the Commonwealth War, public perception towards the American Revolution has significantly shifted. Now, the prevailing opinion within Canadian discourse is that the American Revolution was a grave mistake, and that as the occupiers of America's revolutionary heartland, Canada has finally 'Won' the Revolution for the Redcoats. Officially today, Prime Minister Trudeau denounced the 'Great American Treason' and its legacy, and has forced the City of Boston to repay the damages from the Boston Tea Party, even adjusting the cost for inflation."

 rw_canada.191.d:0 "As part of Trudeau's ongoing battle against Separatist Terrorists, extraordinary measures have been introduced to combat domestic militants within our country. Controversially, these measures have included the use of the RCAF to bomb 'Insurgent Areas' within our own nation, targeting holdouts of Separatist groups with little concern for collateral damage. The use of incendiary bombs against our own population has many Canadians up in arms, with even members of Trudeau's own cabinet lodging complaints. Trudeau remains determined however, and has authorized the bombing of rural communities known to be a hotbed of Separatist sentiment in both Alberta and Quebec. This strategy is meant to both take members of radical groups, and to 'Shock and Awe' the populace of the rebel Provinces. Only time will tell if these bombings will terrorize Albertan and Quebecois citizens away from open rebellion, or if this will simply inspire a new generation of terrorists."

The new Province of Virginia, which encompasses the entire territory of the Commonwealth, has little in common with the former State of Virginia, which lies almost entirely outside Canadian Control. Encompassing the entirety of New England and much of the Rust Belt, there have been differing reasons given for naming the new Province 'Virginia'. Some say the name was meant as a way to humiliate the Populace and break down their American Identity, others see it as a reference to Virginia's historical claims, which once encompassed much of the land the Province now occupies. Whatever the motivation for the Province's etymology may be, the election of Tim Kaine as Governor is a signal to those in the Virginian territories that Democracy is slowly yet surely coming back to America under Canadian supervision."

With that in mind, Justin Trudeau has authorized a top-down reorganization of the CBC, replacing 'Communist Sympathizers' with pure blooded Canadian Patriots willing to do anything for their country. Now, treasonous broadcasts will be censored, and a new focus on Patriotic and anti-Communist entertainment will be paramount. While some have denounced this new course as an attack on free speech, Prime Minister Trudeau assures us that the CBC reforms are only meant to ensure the primacy of authentic Canadian messaging."

However, today, Trudeau has finally stepped aside from his role as Prime Minister, and has announced that brand new elections will be held shortly. Trudeau has finished his life's work in destroying the Soviet Union, and has now vanished from public life.

While his support for Trudeau has spared him from many of the purges that befell the NDP and other Separatist Parties, it seems that Ralph Cruz' luck has finally run out. Discovering a sickening criminal web, Prime Minister Trudeau has finally sicced the RCMP to arrest Cruz, citing a reports finding of corruption, bribery, and even possible links to murder. Seeing this coming for some time, Cruz prepared himself a backup plan, and attempted to flee to Colombia via a private jet. Fortunately, the Mounties caught Cruz just before he could lift off.

This means that if the Bloc wishes to get anything done, they are going to have to collaborate with one of the major parties; the question is which one.

Here in Canada, the need for said balance is badly felt, as our nation's natural beauty is crushed between Capitalism's gears. Industry relocated north by fleeing businessmen has served as a symbol of the flaws of 'Old America',and as symbols of the greed, environmental damage and pollution which wracked the 80's. This has led to a booming new industry of 'Green Technology' taking off, as new firms, both Emigré and Canadian, seek to get on the ground floor of tomorrow's economy. Technologies such as Solar Panels, Electric Cars, Carbon-Neutral transportation and other technological wonders which seek to balance out the needs of humans with the desire to protect the environment. Our strive to encourage both economic growth and ecological preservation with new technologies and social studies has been hailed by many, but has no shortage of critics. Both eco-Socialists who deride the 'commodification of nature', and titans of industry are weary of our nation's green revolution, even if the expansion of such eco-technology would be within their best interests.

However here in Canada, no such excitement is present. There are no coups, no civil wars, no battles in the streets. The edge-of-your-seat dramatics which grace failed states are nonpresent. Politics here revolve around mundane matters, around budgets, numbers, dry and sterile politicians focused on their jobs alone. Some resent our security, the unchanging march that defines the nation we live in. Some long for the embraces of extremism and terror, for the rush of the battle and the passion of the revolution. Luckily, those who dare to resent the Democracy we have built here are alone, either deathly silent or focused on a revolution which will never come.

Trump's use of his private plane for Prime Ministerial travel has certainly been a money saver for the Federal Government, however the use of a non-Air Force jet has been seen as a security risk by many. Today, as Trump's plane flew over the Rocky Mountains during his flight from Winnipeg to Vancouver, some of our worst fears were substantiated when Trump's Boeing 747, dubbed 'Trump Force One', lost communication with Air Traffic Control. As the Prime Minister's plane lost communication, several within Trump's cabinet immediately feared the worst, and scrambled several RCAF jets from CFB Cold Lake to track down the plane. Emergency crews have also been deployed to the immediate area around Kamloops to search for the jet in the event that it did indeed crash. While some have labeled this as brazen alarmism, when the Prime Minister's life is on the line, it isn't possible to be too careful ."

After coming into contact with two Air Force fighter jets from CFB Cold Lake, the team of Trump's private jet confirmed manually that the plane was in working order and that all passengers on board were fine. As the jets located the plane flying safely, there was a legitimate sense of fear that the plane had lost cabin pressure, and that the Prime Minister had succumbed to hypoxia. Responses in such a scenario were mulled over, with many fearing that Trump's plane may have flown into foreign airspace without human control. Worse, the plane could have crashed into a populated area once it ran out of fuel, leading some to even propose shooting it down. Such a scenario has thankfully been avoided."

With Trump Force One now a ghost plane, the cabinet has been left with a truly harrowing decision: either shoot down the Prime Minister's own plane to keep it from crashing into a populated area, or let the plane fly aimlessly until it runs out of fuel and crashes. Traditionally, such an incident would result in the plane being shot down, however the fact that the Prime Minister was in the plane (even if by now they are almost certainly dead), would not be the best move from a PR standpoint. However simply allowing the plane to fly into a populated area may result in the worst disaster since the Commonwealth's infamous 5/1 attacks.\n\nRegardless of their decision, an emergency meeting with the Cabinet and the Governor General has been held to decide on a new leader for the Canadian nation."

Eventually veering off their Vancouver-bound course, the plane crashed in the outskirts of Prince Albert, British Columbia after running out of fuel, thankfully with no casualties on the ground. After recovering the Black Boxes, the TSB quickly concluded the cause of the crash was simple human error. Midway through the flight, the aircraft's heating and cooling systems became non-operational, sending the Prime Minister into a blind rage as he demanded the crew restore temperature control to the uncomfortably cool plane. As the flight crew, desperate to keep their jobs and terrified of the Prime Minister's authority, accidentally turned off the cabin pressurization in an attempt to restore a comfortable temperature. Before they could realize their error, it was too late, and all passengers aboard had succumbed to hypoxia.

Using the powers granted to him when the position of Prime Minister was merged with the Governor-General, Trump has foregone any talks of government formation, and has simply appointed himself as Prime Minister.

The victory of Communist parties in France and Western Europe has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the given Democratic Process is a grave violation of individual freedom, and at the slightest pressure the idiot masses will be swayed by false promises, and will be misled into voting their ways into Welfare States and Commuism. Thiel, vested with complete executive authority, has finally made Canada face this reckoning, dissolving formally the Federal Government and returning complete authority to the Provinces. From now on, Thiel shall serve only as the guardian, as the figurehead for a vast patchwork of self-governing subdivisions. This has meant, in a sense, the end of the Canadian experiment that was, and the beginning of a new identity as dozens of seperate self-governing entities within a singular 'Nation'.

While their neoreactionary ideals oppose democracy, viewing it as being anti-freedom, 'Exit' is voting with your feet, beinging your labor to another 'gov-corp' or governmental corporation, a complex patchwork of small, and competing, autonomous city-states. In their view, if gov-corp doesn’t deliver acceptable value for its taxes (sovereign rent), they can notify its customer service function, and if necessary take their custom elsewhere. Gov-corp would concentrate upon running an efficient, attractive, vital, clean, and secure country, of a kind that is able to draw customers. The 'gov-corps' are autonomous city-states or microstates, assuming they all agree on their national borders, their level of deterrence is perfect, and there are no democracies which could rival them. Thiel himself, while resisting a full transition to Neocameralist city states, has authorized the founding of several independent settlments which would function similarly to the visions of Land and Yarvin. Individual jurisdictions still remain free to follow the outdated old system - however these new independent settlements shall have full freedom, guaranteed by Prime Minister Thiel, to implement the Dark Enlightenment as they wish.

John Rustad, despite having no acquaintance with the former Reform Party, is also a stalwart of Western Canadian values. Cruz, once a diehard opponent of Trump, has begun gradually changing his tune as the 'Unite the Right' movement evolves and adjusts to Trump's passing. In a highly publicized event today, Rustad and Cruz met to secure the merger of the Progressive Conservative Party and the Canadian Alliance into the new 'Conservative Party of Canada'.

One such use of AI has been in what are colloquially known as 'Chatbots', AI models meant to simulate conversation. Through recent years AI scientists have been growing closer to passing the so-called 'Turing Test', a measure of a machine's ability to exhibit human intelligence. Recently, some of Thiel's most faithful have been working on a Trump-themed Chatbot, known humorously to some as 'TRUMPNET'. This AI model was trained on all public and private records of the late Prime Minister. This AI system has managed with some success to capture and emulate Trump’s decision-making, rhetoric, and political vision. This ambitious project has aimed to create a digital version of Trump that could serve as an advisor to the Canadian government, providing guidance on everything from border security to economic reform. The development is expected to push the boundaries of AI, integrating not only his policies but his charismatic persona into a lifelike virtual presence which will continue to influence Canada long after his untimely passing. While some have cheered on this effort, either as an AI-fueled way to bring the Prime Minister back to life or simply as a tribute to Donald Trump, others have voiced concern about the project, and about the potential role of AI in governance.

This AI leader would be a powerful figurehead, ensuring that Canada's policies remain aligned with Trump's vision, even if the real individual is no longer present. With the rapidly growing capabilities of artificial intelligence, these figures argue that the AI version of Trump could bring the same level of influence and change to Canada that he once did. However, critics are quick to raise concerns about the ethics of allowing an artificial construct to wield such immense power. Questions regarding the transparency of decision-making, accountability, and the potential manipulation of the AI’s actions are at the forefront of the debate. Despite these concerns, the proposal has garnered attention, especially among those who believe that Trump's brand of leadership, combined with AI's efficiency, could steer the country through a period of unprecedented change.

 canada_diplo.1.t:0 "2010 Summit of the Democratic League"
 canada_diplo.1.d:0 "The Soviet Order is waning! This has been made clear by the recent assassination of their Premier, Dimitry Yazov in broad daylight. With Yazov dead and various factions within the Soviet Union squabbling and making desperate bids for power, it has become clear that the Union's days are numbered. Even now, the Soviet Order in Europe prepares for the worst, and distant regimes formerly loyal to Moscow now reconsider their allegiances.\n\n This unprecedented opportunity for the Democratic League was the centerpiece of their annual summit in Sydney. Far removed from the sorrow of the 2006 summit in Toronto, the 2008 summit in Anchorage, and the 2009 summit in Honolulu, this assembly of Democratic League members takes place in a new atmosphere of hope for the future. As democratic and capitalist movements have begun resurfacing all over the world, Canada and her allies, for the first time in decades, are in a serious position to challenge the Communist world."
 canada_diplo.1.o1:0 "The Soviet Order is far from secure."
  
 canada_diplo.2.t:0 "Canada Seeks to Repair Relations"
 canada_diplo.2.d:0 "Our relationship with Canada has been icy ever since we refused their call to join their 'Reformed NATO'. We in the United Kingdom, ever content to sit and guard our island, have increasingly begun isolating ourselves from both the Soviet World Order and the Democratic Remnants across the Atlantic. While we still share monarchical links with Canada, our links via the 'Commonwealth of Nations' have long been severed, and in many ways our relations have never recovered. However the Canadians now seek to change this situation, and have extended the Olive Branch once more in an attempt to restore our old friendship. The opening up of relations with the Canadians is a positive sign that the United Kingdom and Canada can continue to work together as equal partners; and while for now we are content with remaining Neutral, our repaired relationship with the Canadians may open up opportunities for Britain in the future."
 canada_diplo.2.o1:0 "They always were our favourite colony."
 
 canada_diplo.3.t:0 "Canada Supports our Cause"
 canada_diplo.3.d:0 "The Canadians have long been covertly arming and supplying Cascadian rebel groups as a means to weaken the Communist government in Los Angeles. Recently, their efforts to undermine the Pacific Government have born fruit, as a full scale uprising in Cascadia has taken place. The Canadians, as our oldest benefactor, have lent support to our fledgling movement, providing us with weaponry, supplies, vehicles, training, as well as a formal recognition on the international stage. Canada, as the impartial inheritors of the US's former UN Security Council seat, have vetoed many motions by the Soviets condemning the Cascadia rebellion, even if the Soviets have in turn, vetoed many Canadian measures supporting us."
 canada_diplo.3.o1:0 "We appreciate the support."
  
 canada_diplo.4.t:0 "Canada Offers Annexation"
 canada_diplo.4.d:0 "The Canadian Government today has approached [CSD.GetLeader] with a surprising offer. Contained, is a proposal for Cascadia to join Canada as the nation's [?CAN_provinces]th Province, relieving administrative strain on our end while still safeguarding Cascadian autonomy. While those are some who support this move, citing how our original rebellion was simply to escape the clutches of Communist Tyranny, others are more reluctant about giving up our nation's newfound independence."
 canada_diplo.4.o1:0 "We're not interested."
 canada_diplo.4.o2:0 "We will join, only if Canada safeguards our autonomy."
   
 canada_diplo.5.t:0 "Cascadia Joins Canada"
 canada_diplo.5.d:0 "The Cascadian Government has responded to our offer with apparent delight; as the Cascadians have agreed to the proposal and will be joining Canada as our [?CAN_provinces]th Province. Their acceptance was not without terms, as they required us to amend Canada’s Constitution to safeguard Cascadian regional autonomy, as well as granting the newly created Province special rights; such as the right to fly the Doug Flag on the same level as the Canadian flag on government buildings. There were many factors which contributed to Cascadia's decision to join Canada, including their high cost of governance, diplomatic isolation, and weak military. Indeed, it seems that Cascadians were more eager to escape from the Communists than actually run a nation, leaving the Cascadian Republic doomed from the start. The incorporation with Canada is seen as a good middle ground which will allow Cascadia to both maintain it's distinct identity, and enjoy the protection of a larger power."
 canada_diplo.5.o1:0 "Wonderful."

 canada_diplo.6.t:0 "Cascadia Refuses"
 canada_diplo.6.d:0 "The Cascadian Government has stated that while they are flattered by our generous offer, they would prefer to remain as an independent nation. Despite this impasse, they have stated that they wish to have closer relations with the Ottawa Government; perhaps even membership in the Democratic League."
 canada_diplo.6.o1:0 "Not what we were hoping for."

 canada_diplo.7.t:0 "Canada Offers Support"
 canada_diplo.7.d:0 "The Canadian Government, while reiterating their opposition to our form of government, has generously offered to supply and aid our struggle against the Government in Philadelphia. Weaponry, Transportation, in addition to supplies and training for our troops have all been provided for us by the Canadians, who wish to use our rebellion as leverage against the APC. Whether this is a precursor to stronger relations between our government and Canada, or merely a case of 'The Enemy is my Enemy' diplomacy remains to be seen."
 canada_diplo.7.o1:0 "We appreciate the support."
 
 canada_diplo.8.t:0 "New England in the Democratic League?"
 canada_diplo.8.d:0 "The Canadians have extended an olive branch, and are oficially offering New England membership in the Democratic League. Some support this move, citing the possibility of a potential Commonwealth invasion, while other more Socialist-minded figures see this as a capitulation to imperialist powers."
 canada_diplo.8.o1:0 "We can join"
 canada_diplo.8.o2:0 "Stay out of it"
 
 canada_diplo.9.t:0 "Canada Proposes Annexation"
 canada_diplo.9.d:0 "The Government in Ottawa has forwarded an interesting proposal to [ROOT.GetLeader], detailing the possible unification between Canada and New England. New England, while in possession of a strong regional identity, does not have a populace overly attached to the concept of New Englander nationhood. Indeed, New England's independence came about as a result of political tensions rather than nationalistic ones. Despite this, there are many within our government who oppose a potential union on the grounds that it would be a capitulation to an imperialist foreign power."
 canada_diplo.9.o1:0 "We can join"
 canada_diplo.9.o2:0 "Stay out of it"
 
 canada_diplo.10.t:0 "New England Joins Canada"
 canada_diplo.10.d:0 "The New Englander Government has supported our proposal for New England to join as Canada's [?CAN_provinces]th Province. New England's acceptance into Confederation as one unified entity has angered some, who wished for Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island to be admitted separately. Regardless, New England has already integrated itself culturally with the rest of Atlantic Canada, with New England being dubbed as the '4th Maritime Province'. Already New England is set to become one of the most powerful provinces within Canada, and a bulwark of Progressive Politics in Canada; with virtually every seat in New England being won by the NDP in their recent snap elections."
 canada_diplo.10.o1:0 "Good news."
  
 canada_diplo.11.t:0 "New England Refuses"
 canada_diplo.11.d:0 "The Government in Boston has mulled over our offer, and has decided to refuse the prospect of joining Canada. While the tone in their refusal letter varies, the Government of New England has stated that they do not feel comfortable subjecting themselves to the whim of a 'Foreign Power', going further to invoke the Boston Tea party as an example of what happened last time New England was subjugated.\n\n Despite New England's refusal of annexation, some still wish to push for closer ties with New England, while others propose the swift neutralization of this rogue breakaway state."
 canada_diplo.11.o1:0 "Leave them be."
 canada_diplo.11.o2:0 "Offer DL Membership."
 canada_diplo.11.o3:0 "Take them out."
   
 canada_diplo.12.t:0 "Annexationist Rhetoric on the Rise"
 canada_diplo.12.d:0 "There has been a marked increase in voices calling for Alaska's annexation into Canada. While Alaska has a strong national identity, it seems that much of Alaska's nationalist rhetoric has been drowned out by those who seek incorporation with Canada. This has raised the question of a potential referendum to decide if Alaska should decide to join the Canadians officially."
 canada_diplo.12.o1:0 "Leave them be."
 canada_diplo.12.o2:0 "Hold a referendum on Annexation."
    
 canada_diplo.14.t:0 "Alaska Votes to Join Canada"
 canada_diplo.14.d:0 "There has been a marked increase in voices calling for Alaska's annexation into Canada both within Alaska, and in the Canadian Government. The Alaskan Government has responded to this growing movement by holding a national plebiscite on the matter; a vote which would decide decisively whether Alaska should remain an independent nation, or be officially absorbed into Canada.\n\n This Referendum has concluded with a slim majority voting for incorporation with Canada. This result has been denounced by the Alaskan President and Alaskan independence movements, however has been begrudgingly accepted by the Alaskan Government; which has begun Alaska's transition from independent State to Canadian Province."
 canada_diplo.14.o1:0 "Interesting."
 
 canada_diplo.15.t:0 "No Change in Canadian Situation"
 canada_diplo.15.d:0 "The Alaskan Government has responded to public pressure by declaring they are content with the current situation in regards to Canada. Instead of annexation or independence, Alaska and Canada will continue the situation that has stood for the last 20 years, with Alaska relying on Canada for material support but still remaining an independent nation. The response to this in Alaska has been moot, with some celebrating our continued independence, and others denouncing our continued reliance on the Canadians."
 canada_diplo.15.o1:0 "Interesting."
 
 canada_diplo.16.t:0 "Treaty of Anchorage"
 canada_diplo.16.d:0 "Today, Canadian Prime Minister [CAN.GetLeader] has met with Alaskan President [ALA.GetLeader], detailing new provisions regarding the relationship between Canada and Alaska. This 'Treaty of Anchorage' has returned much of the control over Alaska's Foreign policy back to the Alaskan Government. While unofficial, the Canadian Government has had an unspoken degree of control over Alaskan foreign policy; something which the Treaty of Anchorage aims to reverse. The silent Canadian control over Alaskan diplomacy has oficially ended today, as the Treaty of Anchorage has oficiallized Alaska's complete control over their own affairs."
 canada_diplo.16.o1:0 "Interesting."
 
 canada_diplo.17.t:0 "Resistance against Alaskan Integration"
 canada_diplo.17.d:0 "As the Alaskan government prepares their transition from Nation to Province, the Alaskan citizenry, long used to basking in their self-reliance, have reacted less than kindly to the news that their beloved nation will be no more. While these protests against integration have not been violent, there have been widespread protests across Alaska. The AKIP, the party which led Alaska to independence against the United States, has announced its intention to run candidates on both a Provincial and Federal Level, stating that they will push a platform of Alaska independence from Canada. Additionally, they have promised to practice a strategy of abstentionism if they are to win any seats in the House of Commons. Additionally, several recounts of the referendum votes have revealed a slimmer majority than once thought; leaving many to denounce the results of the vote as being 'Rigged by Ottawa'.\n\n Others have supported these results, and look hopefully on Alaska's future with Canada; drawing parallels with the 1949 Canadian annexation of Newfoundland, and the positive results reaped by Newfoundlanders after Confederation."
 canada_diplo.17.o1:0 "I'm sure they'll tire themselves out."
 
 canada_diplo.18.t:0 "Intervention against Montana"
 canada_diplo.18.d:0 "It has come to Prime Minister [CAN.GetLeader]'s attention that the despicable White Supremacist and Neo-Nazi regime in Montana, is attempting to reverse-engineer the remains of the American Nuclear Arsenal scattered around their territory. Luckily, our intel suggests that they are far from being able to wield a functioning Nuclear Weapon, and thus are not considered a reasonable threat. However, we can't well wait around until they are in a position to project Nuclear Power. Thus, the Prime Minister has authorized immediate military action against Montana, neutralizing their would-be Nuclear Arsenal and overthrowing the detestable regime of [MOT.GetLeader] in Great Falls."
 canada_diplo.18.o1:0 "The time has come."

 canada_diplo.19.t:0 "Intervention against Lincoln"
 canada_diplo.19.d:0 "It has come to Prime Minister [CAN.GetLeader]'s attention that the despicable White Supremacist and Neo-Nazi regime in Linclon, is attempting to reverse-engineer the remains of the American Nuclear Arsenal scattered around their territory. Luckily, our intel suggests that they are far from being able to wield a functioning Nuclear Weapon, and thus are not considered a reasonable threat. However, we can't well wait around until they are in a position to project Nuclear Power.

 canada_diplo.19.o1:0 "The time has come."

 canada_diplo.20.t:0 "Fate of the Northwestern Armies"
 canada_diplo.20.d:0 "The fall of the Fascist regimes in Montana and Idaho have given way to a period of Canadian occupation. It is, however abundantly clear that this occupation can not last forever. The plan is to rebuild an independent armed force in the American Northwest, one which can effectively conduct itself and fend off the White Supremacist militias which still roam the countryside. To achieve this, the Canadian Government has invested heavily in new cutting-edge gear, weaponry and military advisors for the new armies of Montana and Idaho. However this plan has fallen short in many areas, as much of the know-how on how to operate this equipment is known only to Canadian advisors, and not the Americans themselves. This unfortunate reliance on Canada has many worried that the armies of the Northwest may not be able to stand on their own two feet once the Canadians leave; others have dismissed these fears as hyperbole, and have promised continued support until such a time as the Northwest can achieve full military self-reliance.\n\n Regardless, there are still those in our General Staff who propose more significant investments in upkeep, and a broader focus on concrete strategy, something which would be more sustainable for rustic and isolated area. They also propose a greater focus on training for soldiers, as well as investments in more practical technology, rather than what's the most modern."
 canada_diplo.20.o1:0 "Keep cycling in Canadian Soldiers."
 canada_diplo.20.o2:0 "Rebuild their armies from the ground up!"

 canada_diplo.21.t:0 "Fate of Northwestern Leaders"
 canada_diplo.21.d:0 "Our intention for the Northwest is to rebuild Democracy in Montana and Idaho, and the banishment of the vile White Supremacist cells which still plague the countryside. Despite our intentions, routing the various Militias which still roam the wilds of Montana and Idaho is a task easier said than done. This has led to much of our military establishment favoring a policy of 'collaboration' with the Militias, simply bribing them to stay out of our business and shifting the burden on to the local population. This has allowed a powerful underground to emerge in the Pacific Northwest, with former Neo-Nazi leaders turning to illegal means such as narcotics, moonshine and banned weaponry to fund their lifestyle. This market, while in close proximity to the Canadian border, has not spread to Canada due to a mutual understanding with ringleaders. This practical alliance between the Canadian government and the Northwest Black Market, while successfully managing to stem the flow of illegal goods into Canada, has also cost the Canadian government both untold funds and a significant amount of credibility with the restored governments of Montana and Idaho, who warn that this Black Market may become an uncontrollable force once the Canadian garrison departs."
 canada_diplo.21.o1:0 "Coninue cutting deals with former Militia Leaders."
 canada_diplo.21.o2:0 "We have no room for loyalists to the former regimes."

 canada_diplo.22.t:0 "Fate of the Northwestern Political System"
 canada_diplo.22.d:0 "The main aim of our stabilization mission in the American Northwest was to restore the Democratic Governments of Montana and Idaho, which have previously been lost to White Supremacist groups. This objective, while a noble one, is also an immensely difficult task; increasingly so considering the omnipresence of Neo-Nazi groups in both the Northwest's countryside, and lurking within the transitional government. While our policy on dealing with these stragglers is anything but consistent, our policy in advising the Montanan/Idahoan governments on the matter has remained rather consistent. This response focuses on a strong Central Government which can quickly effectively respond to threats, focusing on the utilization of command centers and urban infrastructure. This strategy, while not without its merits, has drawn criticism for neglecting the Northwest's rural terrain and reclusive population. Critics furthermore have argued that this policy as putting too much focus on the central government at the expense of local and county governments.\n\n The Canadian High Command however believes that shifting too much focus to local governments could potentially open the door to White Supremacist and Neo-Nazi infiltration."
 canada_diplo.22.o1:0 "Focus on a Strong Government."
 canada_diplo.22.o2:0 "Ensure a decentralized administration."
 
 canada_diplo.23.t:0 "Reconstruction of the Northwest"
 canada_diplo.23.d:0 "The long process of stabilizing the Northwestern Former United States has concluded today, as the Canadian Military has officially departed from their posts in Great Falls and Spokane. The State-Era institutions in Montana and Idaho, previously abolished by White Supremacist militias, have been restored in full. With the remains of the vile Neo-Nazi regimes being dismantled, Montana and Idaho have risen on their own as independent democratic nations, free from Fascistic oppression and Canadian occupation. Fears of a potential return to the Covington-era have been allayed, as the remaining Neo-Nazi militias scattered in the countryside have failed to gain any ground. The few powerful resistance cells left over by the Covington government have either collapsed due to infighting or have surrendered to the Montanan Army, and the final dedicated supporters of Richard Spencer's insane philosophy have either retreated in to the isolated woods to wither away, or have followed Spencer into his exile (and practical house-arrest) in the Soviet Union.\n\n While we can never know what the future will hold, it seems that the prospects for the new Republics of Montana and Idaho are bright."
 canada_diplo.23.o1:0 "Wonderful!"
 
 canada_diplo.24.t:0 "Reconstruction a Failure!"
 canada_diplo.24.d:0 "The final Canadian Soldiers have departed from their posts in the former states of Montana and Idaho today. While we had hoped that the armies of Montana and Idaho could sustain themselves, the White Supremacist militias in the countryside have gained massive traction almost immediately after our withdrawal. The government of Montana collapsed in a matter of days after Canada's departure, with a Neo-Nazi loyalist cell soon storming Great Falls and declaring the 'Second State of Montana'. Timothy McVeigh has been proclaimed the new Commander of the Montanan Nation, which has been reorganized on similar lines to the original Montanan Neo-Nazi Regime of Harold Covington. Meanwhile, in Idaho, Richard Spencer has returned from his exile in the Soviet Union with his diminished contingent of loyalists. Spencer, while managing to reassert control over his American Statelet, has had his position significantly weakened in comparison to the heydays of the Lincoln movement. The bulk of Spencer's support base defected after Spencer fled to the Soviet Union, taking with him many Fascist and Neo-Nazi members who detest Soviet influence.\n\n The Canadian Government has scrambled to evacuate collaborators and members of the former Democratic government, as well as many of the region's few remaining African-American and LGBTQ individuals."
 canada_diplo.24.o1:0 "What a clusterfuck..."
 
 canada_diplo.25.t:0 "Fall of the Fascists"
 canada_diplo.25.d:0 "Success! The vile Fascist governments of Montana and Lincoln have been destroyed by Canada's righteous fury. The disorganized militia forces were no match for the technologically superior Canadian forces, who made quick work of the ragtag 'militaries' of Montana and Idaho.\n [MOT.GetLeader], either out of desperation, or in an attempt to copy Hitler himself, committed suicide in their bunker under Great Falls as Canadian forces surrounded the city. Shortly after, Montana's remaining militia forces tore themselves apart, blaming each other for their catastrophic losses and trying to stabilize the situation themselves.\n Richard Spencer fled from Boise in a small prop-plane, landing in a small airfield outside of Seattle and slipping undetected on to a cargo ship headed for the Soviet Union. Spencer has claimed political asylum with the Soviets; who have quietly relocated him to a Vladivostok mental hospital.\n\n Now that the detestable Neo-Nazi regimes have been banished from these lands, we can finally begin the long process of rebuilding, and eventually restoring the freedom and Democracy that has been lost to citizens of Montana and Idaho for more than 20 years."

That all changed when we decided to take down the Neo-Nazi regimes occupying Montana and Idaho, in the process permanently banishing the Fascist militias from the area. This unprecedented intervention has defied years of non-interventionist policy in regards to the former United States, and has made many question if our policy towards the post-collapse nations is in need of change. Should we take a more active role in defending the post-USA nations, or should we recognize the former Federal Government and assist them in their reclamation of the United States? Of course, there is still a great amount of favor to a more indirect approach, which would uphold our previous policy of nonalignment."

The Prime Minister, viewing the provisions of the act as unacceptable, has gathered Parliament for an emergency session to restore the WMA, a move which has enjoyed support from across the aisle. Indeed, even with a great deal of Canadians placing blame for this crisis solely on Trudeau's shoulders, there has been a certain 'Rally Round the Flag' effect surrounding Trudeau.

 can_history.1.d:0 "The 1997 Canadian federal election was held on June 2, 1989 to elect members of the House of Commons of the 36th Parliament of Canada. This election would have no clear winner, as the NDP, while still the largest party, would go on to lose several seats to the PCs and the resurgent Liberal Party under Jean Chrétien. The Liberals, who gained the lion's share of seats in the election, would still fall short of the NDP under lame-duck Prime Minister Audrey McLaughlin. The Liberal Party sought to form government by allying themselves with the Progressive Conservatives, and the remnants of the Bloc Québecois, who were reduced to only 7 seats in the previous election after the disastrous 1995 Quebec Independence referendum. The 'Purple Coalition' between the Liberals and PCs would together outnumber the NDP, who ultimately found themselves without potential allies. This would result in Governor-General Roméo LeBlanc appointing Jean Chrétien as Prime Minister instead of holding a new election, in what would remain as one of the most controversial decisions in Canadian political history. The Cordon sanitaire established against the Reform Party in this election would also mark the beginning of the end for the party, which lost many 'safe' seats to Progressive Conservative candidates, ultimately foreshadowing their near-annihilation in the 2000 Election, which would see large gains for both the Liberals and the PCs. Despite this, Jean Chrétien's Premiership, while viewed favorably by the Canadian Electorate, would still largely be considered a failure by much of the Canadian political arena due to constant squabbling between the disparate PC/Liberal/Bloc coalition."

After new details of the sponsorship scandal emerged via the Gomery Commission, the PCs ended their coalition with the Liberals and united with the three opposition parties to bring down Liberal Prime Minister Paul Martin's minority government, triggering an unusual winter election. This election would see catastrophic losses by both the Liberals and the Reform Party, and would once more see the Liberal Party reduced to a third party player in Canadian politics. While the NDP would go on to soundly win the 2004 elections, the Progressive Conservatives would also see a shocking resurgence, becoming the official opposition under Prime Minister Bob Rae. The success of the PCs was widely attributed to the prevalence of the 'Unite the Right' movement, and subsequent dissolution of Reform by Preston Manning and endorsement of the PCs. While the Reform Party would continue its presence in the Canadian political scene, the 'betrayal' of their founder did irreparable damage to the Reform Party's prestige on the national stage, and would set the stage for Manning's later election as leader of the Progressive Conservatives."

This election would see the defeat of Bob Rae's incumbent NDP government and the rise of a Progressive Conservative government for the first time since the Mulroney era. Rae's government would be defined by a devastating backbencher revolt by 'Progressive' NDP members. This caucus revolt, started by Jack Layton and supported by former Prime Minister Ed Broadbent, was caused by Rae's support of controversial legislation deemed to be anti-union. The fallout of this conflict would lead to much of the NDP's union base either abandoning the party, or keeping their support for the party quiet. The refusal to cooperate by much of the party would see the NDP rely on the rump Liberal party to avoid a no-confidence vote against Rae, and permanently divide the NDP based on ideological lines. The NDP's alliance with the highly unpopular and corrupt Liberal Party would also further divide the party, and tarnish the NDP's image by association. While the NDP avoided falling apart, Jack Layton announced his intention to challenge Rae for NDP leadership for the second time since 2003, where he was defeated by Bob Rae in part due to a smear campaign by Rae's about Layton’s supposed associations with Socialists."

Known to locals as the 'Silent War', this military conflict was notable for its complete lack of casualties, and its sucsess in its objectives to secure the Danish territory of Greenland. In the aftermath of this operation, the remains of the Kingdom of Denmark were reorganized into the 'Kingdom of Greenland', a nation which preserved both the former Danish government and Greenland's current status within the Danish Realm. The mixed Greenlandic-Danish government, while legally the successor to the former Kingdom of Denmark, was seen by many as simply an independent Greenlandic nation. Any such claims to the Danish homeland was abandoned by Queen Margrethe II, who fully embraced Greenland's new role as a nation independent from Denmark. While this event would lead to Greenland's official independence, in many ways Greenland would remain as a subject, as Canada increasingly took on Denmark's former role as overlords of Greenland."

While the Bush Government in the South attempted to exert their control of the Canal, their lack of spare manpower led to the Panamanian government immediately moving to seize control of the Canal. This action was opposed by the remaining Canal Garrison, which managed to fend off Panama's advances until outside support arrived. Aided by the United Kingdom and Canada, the Canal Zone Garrison managed to keep the Panamanians from seizing control of the Canal, and would eventually lead to Canada taking up the former United States' guardianship of the Canal.

The culmination of multiple years of debate and planning after the failure of the Meech Lake and Charlottetown constitutional accords, the referendum was launched by the provincial Parti Québécois government of Jacques Parizeau This referendum would turn out to be a resounding failure, with an estimated 79% of Quebec's population outright rejecting the possibility of secession. The defeat of the 'Yes' campaign was seen as a combination of poor planning and a distrust of separatist movements developing after the collapse of the United States. The chaos that followed the USA's 'Peaceful' dissolution put a damper on those who wanted to see such separations occur up North, and contributed to a feeling both in Anglophone and Francophone Canada that the nation must stay together at all cost. These feelings, combined with a sense of Canada's newfound status as 'Leader of the Free World', put an end to talks of Quebecois separation, and lead to the Bloc Quebecois' eventual collapse as a major force in Federal Politics."

The historic failure of the IntPhone marks the end of Apple's foray into smart telephone technology, with Steve Wozniak quietly announcing that the company intends to focus solely on Computing technology in the near future; much to the dismay of CEO Steve Jobs.\n\n Despite BlackBerry's rejection of this new 'smart telephone' design, CEO Mike Lazaridis has stated that BlackBerry will look into the implementation of touchscreen technology in the future; albeit as a secondary feature to the now iconic BlackBerry keyboard."

Despite the RCMP originally claiming that the strange object was simply a missile test, the Prime Minister's Office officially stated that the object in question was not a missile, or at the very least not a missile associated with the Canadian Armed Forces. Due to Harbour Mille's proximity to the French territory of St. Pierre and Miquelon, some have feared that the object was a missile launched by the French Communists; albeit no evidence of this claim had come forth and the French Embassy has denied any involvement. The unidentified flying still remains a mystery to the government, despite extensive scrutiny by both the public and the Military. Neither CANADC nor the RCAF was able to detect the object, and neither agency, nor the Canada Command had any information on the objects. The mystery surrounding this event has prompted Member of Parliament for Humber—St. Barbe—Baie Verte (The constituency Harbour Mille is located), Gerry Byrne to press the government for further information regarding the incident and criticized the Conservative government on its lack of transparency."

At sea, enormous waves with heights reaching heights of up to 82 ft were recorded, and on land, heavy rains peaking at 3 inches were recorded across the Maritime Provinces.\n\n As a result of, nearly one million residences have been left without power, mainly in and around the Halifax metro area, which experienced some of the worst impacts from the storm. Further North, in Prince Edward Island, flooding and downed trees have impeded travel throughout the area as well as leaving almost 9,00 homes and businesses without power.\n\n While the damage and power outages have been a great inconvenience to those on Canada's Atlantic coast, hundreds of power crews have been deployed to restore electricity as quickly as possible. As soon as winds dropped below 65 mph, roughly 400 crewmen began work fixing lines damaged by the storm.

The co-founder of technology giant Apple Inc, Jobs, along with Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, were instrumental in shaping the modern world of computing. However despite being the original founder of Apple, Jobs would eventually leave the company due to a falling out with senior leadership, namely CEO John Sculley, leaving along with several employees to found NeXT, a computer platform development company that specialized in computers for higher-education and business markets. The collapse of the United States wreaked havoc on the computing industry in the United States, and the later Communist revolution in California would force Jobs, as well as much of the leadership of both NeXT and Apple, to flee to Canada. By the time Apple and NeXT relocated their operations to Canada, both companies were struggling, and after several failures to break into the Canadian market, Apple purchased Jobs' NeXT, a deal which would put Jobs' back in the CEO's chair. Jobs' later development with software and computing would help cement Canada as the global capital of computing, and would aid in the further development of NetNorth and Telidon systems. While they enjoyed unparalleled success in computing, Apple's attempts to break into mobile and smart technology markets were met with bitter failure.\n\n Jobs was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2004, a type of cancer which typically holds a very poor prognosis. Fortunately for Jobs, his cancer was a much less aggressive type, unfortunately, Jobs consistently resisted his doctor's advice, instead seeking to treat his cancer with alternative medicine, namely an all-fruit diet. Jobs' cancer was successfully removed after a pancreaticoduodenectomy aimed at removing the tumor, resulting in it going into remission. However despite this, the cancer was still present, and today Jobs succumbed to a complication from the previous procedure at his Vancouver home. A small funeral service was held, and Jobs was buried in an unmarked grave, as requested. He is succeeded as CEO of Apple by Tim Cook, and has been honored in an official capacity by both B.C.

The company, founded as a telephone-manufacturing division of Alexander Graham Bell's very own telephone company quickly grew into Canada's leading tech giant by the early 90's, once boasting a market capitalization about half the size of Mexico's entire gross national income and a workforce equal to the population of Waterloo, Ontario. However, now details that the company has become a financial black hole, with senior officials using the company’s reserves as a 'cookie jar' to create an illusion of profitability that netted them personal bonuses. As more information is revealed, it has become clear that the vast majority of the company's financial reports were complete fabrications. While experts have predicted that Nortel's period of rapid growth and acquisition were unsustainable for years, the fact that the company has imploded so quickly is a shock to Bay Street. Throughout the recent months, a veritable avalanche of new information has come out about the company, revealing that the company was in deep financial trouble even before the crisis within Nortel became public knowledge. With the book-cooking operation going on behind the scenes at Nortel finally bubbling to the surface, the company's remaining value has tanked, and senior leadership has reportedly been looking into bankruptcy protections. As one of Canada's largest tech giants implodes in real time, a cascade of pain from both investors and consumers has been felt, as many now fear that much Nortel's cutting-edge technology may be lost to time if the company were to go under.

The new Federal budget is set to leave Canadians penniless — literally. Indeed, among the victims of cutbacks outlined by the Finance Minister is Canada's one-cent coin. Citing low purchasing power and rising production costs, the government has decided to phase the penny out of existence starting this fall, when the Royal Canadian Mint will stop distributing the one-cent coin to financial institutions. While the government noted on Thursday that one-cent coins will always be accepted in cash transactions for as long as people still hold on to them, it is expected that soon the penny will effectively become extinct. The value of the penny has decreased to about 1/20th of its original purchasing power. In part because of rising prices for the metals it's made of, the costs to produce the penny exceed its spending power. With the penny being eliminated from cash transactions, prices will be rounded up or down to the nearest five-cent increment.\n\n While some have mourned the loss of their beloved little coins, the Federal government has hailed this action as one that will save both the taxpayers, and the Royal Canadian Mint millions of dollars."

While intensely focused on building bridges to other provinces and international markets for Alberta’s oil, Ms. Redford stumbled in the polls and lost control of her caucus. Even Alberta’s strong economy, low jobless rate and balanced operating budget wasn’t enough to keep the lid on critics of her travel budget. Before she resigned, Ms. Redford listed her government’s accomplishments.

However the true source of Epstein's death was revealed to be far more complicated.\n\nThe RCMP had already compiled evidence of Epstein's sexual involvement with underaged girls by 2004, but were stopped from taking direct action due to Epstein's political connections. Those who attempted to reveal the true nature of Epstein's crimes were forcibly silenced, or in rare cases, assassinated themselves. This led to the relevant information being passed on to CSIS, who acted in secret to take Epstein down themselves. Contrary to popular belief, Epstein did not in fact die in the car bombing, but was rather kidnapped early in the morning with a stand-in corpse being killed in the explosion as a cover. Proposals were made to make his death look like a suicide, however it became clear that it was ruled that suicide would be too suspicious of a reason for anyone to buy. After being absconded by CSIS, Epstein was relentlessly ‘pressured’ into giving up the names of his high-profile associates, which were compiled into the Dossier recently handed to the Minister of Justice. It was not clear the true source of Epstein's death, however it is generally believed that he was tortured to death during the CSIS's period of 'Intense Questioning'."

However as things tend to do when the hijinks of teenage hooligans are involved, things went very, very wrong.

The prospect of getting rid of Daylight Savings Time is far from a new concept to Canadians, with Saskatchewan observing Central Time year-round since 1966. Those who favour a fixed, national, year-round standard time is a better option than daylight saving time for our health, mood and well-being. These claims are backed up by many organizations, who point to the disruption to human circadian rhythms during the clock changes. Additionally, DST is shown to have a net negative effect on the economy, and has been opposed by farmers, particularly dairy farmers as the milking patterns of their cows do not change with the time. With most of the nation opposing the presence of a regular time change, many have questioned the point of keeping DST around. A growing movement within Parliament has challenged Prime Minister [CAN.GetLeader] to take action on the matter, however due to the niche subject and very mild inconvenience of the clock change, it is likely that little to no action will be taken.

 can_flavour.29.d:0 "On March 15th 2005, the City of Hamilton was rocked by a most terrible explosion, as Jeffrey Epstein, prominent financier and Senator for Ontario, was killed in an apparent Car Bombing. Epstein, while being a reasonably well known figure with deep ties to wealthy Emigrés, was relatively unknown to the rest of Canada; only being appointed to the Senate three years prior on the advice of several prominent American Exiles. His death was ruled as an accidental explosion caused by a faulty ignition system in his car, however many have not been so quick to buy the official story, as the case was shut abruptly soon. Indeed, many whistleblowers both within the CSIS and the RCMP have alleged external interference in cases that were adjacent to Epstein and his allies, and have suggested that his death was part of some greater coverup. Over almost 10 years, these whispers have grown into shouts, and as the Department of Justice finally takes action, a truly horrific portrait of Epstein has been painted. Corroborated by a mysterious dossier appearing on the Minister of Justice's desk, it seems that Senator Epstein led a secret double life, serving as broker by day and an eminent sex-trafficker by night. Epstein's connection with the highest echelons of finance, business, politics and entertainment may serve to explain his mysterious death; with his assassination being either a way to silence him, prevent him from blackmailing them, or as an act of revenge by one of his countless victims. Whatever the case may be, Epstein's accomplices have been swiftly prosecuted by the RCMP, and a greater investigation into his vast sex-trafficking network has begun immediately. Unfortunately, the fact that Epstein's death has been a cold case for almost 10 years makes tracking down those who have engaged in illegal sexual acts with Epstein's victims much more difficult."

While thankfully the attacks appeared to be isolated to just New York, the aftermath of this deadly terrorist attack has been the cause for serious introspection among both CSIS and Canada's Transportation Safety Board, who is looking into more stringent safety regulation for airliners to avoid such catastrophes in the future.

This has resulted in many staples of pre-collapse American life living on in Canada, while their locations South of the Border are left to rot.

IntraFlix, a chain originally dedicated to the quick delivery of DVDs and VHS tapes through the mail, has quickly broken in to the Intranet Video market; soon becoming champions due to public dissatisfaction with Blockbuster's ubiquitous late fees. Even though an offer had been on the table for Blockbuster to purchase IntraFlix, the common perception in the company that the late-fees were more than enough to sustain themselves prevented them from finalizing the deal. Until recently. Blockbuster today has officially purchased IntraFlix, and thus has taken over the ground floor of Intranet Video Streaming. With Blockbuster now firmly in control of this valuable subset of the market, most analysts predict a bright future for both Blockbuster and the Video Streaming Industry; with many going so far as to predict that the iconic Blockbuster stores may be phased out in favour of an online-centric model."

While at first, maple syrup sounds like an odd target for burglary unless you're planning to rob a pancake luncheon on the same day, when you consider that maple syrup is worth up to 25 times more than a barrel of crude oil, the payoff starts to sound a little sweeter. Throughout recent months, contents of 9,571 barrels, valued at over 18 million dollars, were stolen from a FPAQ facility in Saint-Louis-de-Blandford, Quebec. The syrup was stored in unmarked white metal barrels inspected only once a year. Thieves used trucks to transport barrels to a remote sugar shack, where they siphoned off the maple syrup, refilled the barrels with water, then returned them to the facility. This illegally-trafficked syrup was then smuggled over the Commonwealth border, and sold in small batches to mainly legitimate distributors who were unaware of its origin.\n\nDuring an annual inspection, the thievery was discovered, and several perpetrators were arrested.

Early network engineers once envisioned a loosely-connected and federated system, with a single “national spine” that linked together various regional networks tailored to and managed by the regions themselves. These plans would become the backbone for the Trans-Canada Computer Communications Network, a proposed pre-Intranet Canada-wide ‘Web’. However these plans would eventually be scrapped, shelved until the decline and later collapse of the United States emphasized the need for a uniquely Canadian computer network separate from the United States. The TCCN, which would eventually mature into NetNorth by the 1990s, is Canada's hallmark online network, serving the digital needs of the entire nation.\n\n Despite this, smaller, more secluded networks typically set up by private companies or individual citizens, mainly piggybacking on the work of NetNorth have popped up across the nation. These networks, typically unsupervised and unmaintained, had become the only online connections for many of Canada's rural communities. But now that the various local networks across Canada have been brought under the CanConnect Umbrella, a wide-reaching review of former NetNorth operations has been authorized, aimed at 'cleaning up' and fixing more dated sections of the Canadian web. With the aging NetNorth finally being phased out for the more modern CanadaConnect System, Canadian web developers, eager to break ground on the new 'Web 2.0', have named Canada's own unique and newly-minted OS in honour of NetNorth. This new 'NetNorth' 4.0 bears little similarity to the original NetNorth, and instead serves as a unique operating system available to computers running on the CanConnect Network.

Harper was among the first Reform MPs to oppose Manning's endorsement of the Progressive Conservative Party, and continued running candidates as leaders despite Manning's own disavowal. Staying on as leader of Reform until its absorption, Harper has still criticized Manning on a number of issues despite being his de facto number two. A notable source of the fundamental divide between the two men is Harper's strong commitment to conservative principles, as opposed Manning's inclinations toward populism, which Harper sees as leading to compromise on core ideological matters.

Others have cast doubt on the possibility of the theory being true, pointing to the inconsistent timing between Pierre's visit and Trudeau's birth. Overall, the rumor is generally presented in a tongue-and-cheek way, with most who fully buy the connection already having a less than favorable opinion of the Prime Minister in the first place. However there are still some who fear that this urban myth may undermine Trudeau's struggle against Soviet forces, and have suggested that the Prime Minister take a paternity test; even if doing so would legitimize such rumors."

 can_flavour.49.d:0 "A new scandal has rocked the Liberal Government of Justin Trudeau, detailing an improper intervention into a court case involving the Quebec-based construction company SNC-Lavalin. Allegations detail that the Prime Minister improperly influenced Minister of Justice and Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the ongoing case, and had reshuffled her from the position when she refused. The Quebec-based construction company has been under allegations of bribery, and for taking money from corrupt regimes such Gadaffi's Libya and Saddam's Iraq. To avoid prosecution for fraud, the company lobbied Prime Minister Trudeau for a change to the Criminal Code which would allow them to skirt the rules. As the news of this scandal becomes public, the Ethics Commissioner, under pressure from the major opposition parties, has launched a formal investigation into the alleged interference. This scandal has caused several prominent Liberal MPs to resign their seats, and the Leader of the Opposition has called for Trudeau to formally resign, stating that he had lost the moral authority to govern. Raybould's actions have been applauded by all opposition parties, with the Opposition Leader calling Trudeau's decision to remove her a 'betrayal of justice', and adding that people who blow the whistle on misconduct should be protected, not punished ."

 can_flavour.50.d:0 "When Michael Ignatieff defied the odds to win the 2011 Federal Election, many Canadians seemingly didn't know the first thing about him. Aside from his academic and broadcasting work, there truly seems to be nothing interesting about Ignatieff besides the fact that he's the Prime Minister. In fact, it seems among the most interesting facts about Ignatieff is the status of his family, a proud lineage of diplomats and scholars hailing from pre-Revolution Russia. This family connection has led some to believe that as Canada leads the fight against Communism seemingly alone, for Michael Ignatieff, the struggle against the Soviets may be much more personal. Throughout the Prime Minister's foreign policy messaging, Ignatieff has glorified Tsarist Russia, championed the Russian Whites as a force against the Bolsheviks, and denounced the Soviet Union's repression of the Orthodox Church. Ignatieff's glorification of pre-Revolution Russia, while undoubtedly effective against the Soviet Union, has caused many to ponder Ignatieff's loyalty to his Canadian identity, and if his run for Prime Minister was nothing more than a crusade to avenge his family."

 can_flavour.51.d:0 "As our nation's premier financial institution, the direction of the Bank of Canada is among the key factors which influences future monetary policy within Canada. Donald Trump, ever the critic of previous financial policy, has declared that he intends to replace the current Governor of the Bank of Canada with an emigré, who he claims would be more knowledgeable and do a better job than one of their Canadian peers. This announcement has stirred up some anger both within the Canadian populace, and within the world of finance, as the Prime Minister does not have the unilateral authority to appoint a new Governor of the Bank of Canada. Of course, the Trump-loyalist Privy Council is unlikely to refuse the Prime Minister's choice for new Governor. Three candidates are reportedly in the running for BoC Governor, all of them emigrés. First is Wilbur Ross, a corporate restructuring expert nicknamed the 'King of Bankruptcy'. Next is the current Minister of Finance, Steve Mnuchin, who is the official the BoC Governor currently reports to. While there is theoretically nothing which prevents the Minister of Finance from serving in both positions, appointing Mnuchin as Governor would be an undeniably odd choice. Finally, and perhaps most controversially, is Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner. A former real-estate investor, Kushner is the current former Minister of Employment and Social Development, where he has been blamed for worsening the housing crisis by many. As someone who both has little experience in Banking, and is in the Trump family, the choice of Kushner would be seen by many as a nepotistic move, and would further raise distrust in the Trump Ministry's motives.

 can_flavour.52.d:0 "In 1964, Gene Roddenberry started a project which would forever shape popular culture as we know it. The original 'Star Trek' series, once ignored, soon grew into undeniably the most influential work of science fiction in media history, attracting countless fans, and featuring prominent Canadian actors such as James Doohan and William Shatner. Despite harships, Star Trek has attracted a massive legion of loyal fans dubbed as 'Trekkies', many of which have occupied prominent positions in science, technology and politics. Prime Minister Layton himself is an ardent fan of Star Trek, even owning a custom-tailored Starfleet uniform which he proudly wore to a 1991 Star Trek convention. While the franchise has had unclear ownership ever since the collapse of the United States, most avid fans of Star Trek agree that it is for the best; as such a monumental work of fiction should not be bound to a single owner, but rather be free for all to enjoy. The Canadian Nation under Prime Minister Layton perhaps best exemplifies Roddenberry's vision of a world where humanity has reached maturity and wisdom, and shall not just tolerate, but take special delight in differences in ideas and differences in life form."

 can_flavour.53.d:0 "As Prime Minister Rae secures his grip over the NDP, an overwhelming resentment of 'Socialist' policies has washed over both the NDP, and the Canadian Political Establishment. Despite this, the Prime Minister, while undoubtedly a staunch opponent of the radical left, has been on record encouraging both those within the NDP and the opposition to tone down rhetoric towards those deemed as 'Socialists' and 'Communists'. Already our nation has experienced intense alarmism surrounding left-wing ideologies considering the Soviet Union's victory and the rise of the two prominent socialist dictatorships on our borders, however Rae had previously inflamed these tensions in an attempt to keep control of the NDP. This has resulted in prominent left-wing voices such as Jack Layton being incorrectly smeared as radical Communists trying to destroy Canadian Democracy as we know it. To prevent a further rise in political violence and divisive rhetoric, Rae has denounced the 'Neo-McCarthyists' who have tried to slander Rae's opponents as traitors. While he has stated his disagreement with their rhetoric and ideals, he has defended them as patriots who love their country and the furthest thing from the Communist Radicals some people have painted them as."

 can_flavour.54.d:0 "The Liberal Party of Canada has been in a rather consistent state of decline ever since the early 90's, with short periods of political prominence interrupted by long stretches of complete irrelevance. While many had hoped that the 2011 Election would be their moment back in the spotlight, it seems that these dreams will remain unfulfilled. Seeing the writing on the wall, several prominent Liberals have jumped ship to the NDP, who they now say holds the same viewpoints as the wilting Liberal Party. Among the most prominent defects is Michael Ignatieff, a prominent figure within the party and Rae's former roommate in the University of Toronto, who has stated that Rae exemplifies the Liberal spirit and that working with the NDP is the best course forward for the Liberal Party. The defection of prominent Liberals has once more sparked debate within the shambles of the Liberal Party, with many proposing that they simply join with the NDP to avoid the spoiler effect in closely-contested seats. Of course, the NDP's left-wing bitterly opposes any reconciliation with the Liberal Party, as they fear that their already minimal influence would be annihilated if a wave of new moderate voters were to join the party."

 can_flavour.55.d:0 "A new scandal has rocked the Progressive Conservative Government of [CAN.GetLeader], as allegations detail an organized campaign of voter suppression in the riding of Guelph. According to reports, an organized campaign of automated calls (known as 'RoboCalls]), attempted to dissuade voters from casting their ballots by passing on incorrect information, such as claims that their polling location had been moved. Further investigations have revealed that this campaign contained a mix of both in-person operators and automated call centers. Additionally, claims have been made that calls falsely posing as being from the NDP and Liberal Party, often being rude, racist and stating incorrect information were made, which would be a crime under Canada Elections Act, which makes misrepresenting oneself as a political party a crime. Elections Canada has announced a comprehensive investigation into the scandal, and has been joined by RCMP officials and Conservative Party lawyers. Prime Minister [CAN.GetLeader] has denied knowledge or involvement in this operation, and has blamed the mixup on the Liberals and unnamed third party. Thus far, no charges have been brought against those accused."

 can_flavour.56.d:0 "Renowned actor Kiefer Sutherland has just become the latest in the string of many influential celebrities to join the political game. Sutherland, as the son of renowned actor Donald Sutherland and grandson of NDP leader Tommy Douglas, has found himself as the heir to both an extensive acting and political dynasty. While previously tight-lipped about his family's political heritage, Sutherland has finally made the decision to jump into the political game after the vacation of a Commons seat in his native Toronto. Kiefer Sutherland successfully sought the NDP's nomination for candidacy in the Beaches—East York electoral district, which was scheduled to have a special election after the death of their incumbent Member of Parliament in a car crash earlier this year. A highly competitive district between the NDP and the Liberal Party, Sutherland has managed to hold the district for the NDP in a highly publicized campaign. Sutherland's campaign has attracted no shortage of detractors and supporters, with Conservatives accusing him of coasting off his grandfather's name, and Progressives hailing Sutherland as the inheritor of Tommy Douglas' legacy. As this renowned actor enters the halls of Parliament in Ottawa, it is yet to be seen whether Sutherland can match his grandfather's legacy as a great NDP Parliamentarian, or if he will find himself as a fish out of water in the political world."
