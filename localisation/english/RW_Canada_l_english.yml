 CAN_RED_WORLD_DESC:0 "Canada remains as one of the last beacons of Freedom and Stability in the chaotic Soviet-dominated world. The leader of some of the last few democratic capitalist regimes on the planet, Canada has taken up the mantle of 'Leader of the Free World', flourishing in arenas where Britain and America have failed. While not free from trouble by any stretch of the imagination, 20 years of America's best and brightest fleeing across the border has allowed Canada to assert itself as a great power in its own right. Only time will tell if they can maintain their newfound prowess and take back what has been lost, or if Canada will meet the same fate as their Southern neighbors."

 ### LEADER BIOS ###
 ###################
 
 POLITICS_CAN_PRESTON_MANNING_DESC:0 "Preston Manning, a champion of the conservative and populist values common in Western Canada, founded and led the Reform Party of Canada to many victories in both provincial and federal elections in the decade following the Great American Collapse. For a time it appeared that his party was on course to usurp the Progressive Conservatives as the major right-wing force in the country after Brian Mulroney's disastrous premiership resulted in a landslide victory for the New Democratic Party in 1989. However, the stabilization period after America's demise and NATO's collapse led to mainstream parties experiencing an enormous resurgence, especially the revitalized PCs. After a devastating loss in the 2000 election, Manning resigned as party leader and subsequently dissolved Reform. For many years he remained retired from politics to become simply a footnote in Canada's history, failing to gain enough seats to govern even at his party's height. However, when the Liberal Party became mired by the biggest corruption scandal in Canadian history, Manning was inspired to once again rejoin the political arena and take down the corrupt establishment. In 2003 Manning officially joined the PCs, and after the Liberal-PC coalition government of Paul Martin fell to the NDP in 2006 he was seen as a clear candidate to restore a true conservative vision to the country. Less than a month later PC members elected him as their next party leader, and in 2008 Manning rode the back of a populist wave to finally become prime minister of Canada. The aging leader has a clear vision for the country but the question remains; does he have the time and influence to achieve it?"

 CAN_leader_of_the_free_world_desc:0 "Left stranded as the last remnant of the Free World, Canada valiantly continues the fight for Freedom, Democracy, and Capitalism in the New World. While the United States has been swept into the dustbin of history, and Britain refuses the call, Canada along with the scattered remitments of the world's Democratic and Capitalist regimes keep up their resistance against Soviet Hegemony. Forced to shoulder the responsibilities of the old United States, Canada will remain steadfast, the last line of defense against Communism. We stand On Guard for Thee, ready to liberate the fallen world once the time comes, or to defend against Soviet Tyranny if they decide to once more incur in the New World.\n\n Our icy cold slice of this blue marble shall always remain free, against all the world; Canada will remain the True North: Strong and Free.

 CAN_buisness_haven:0 "Business Haven"
 CAN_buisness_haven_desc:0 "The collapse of the United States did irreparable damage to the American world of business, as exectives fled from the undeveloped South, and from the former Business hubs of Los Angeles and New York, now in the hands of Communists. In lieu of the highly unstable former United States, the remnants of American Big Business decided to resettle in Canada, taking their wealth and industrial prowess with them. The flight of American Business, while transforming Canada in to an industrial and financial powerhouse, has also infected Canada with a prevailing culture of corruption. The cutthroat world of American Business has sunk its teeth in to Canada, and it appears that for now, the American Corporations have enough funds at their disposal to effortlessly manipulate the Canadian Government into doing their bidding, or simply turning a blind eye to their less than legal practices.

 CAN_american_immigration:0 "Constant American Influx"
 CAN_american_immigration_desc:0 "America was once a land of untold prosperity, however years of stagnation and decline left the United States as a shadow of their former selves. The collapse of the USA was the last straw for many Americans, as a mass exodus from the Former United States followed shortly after. Thousands of Refugees in the border cities fled to Canada in hopes of escaping the coming violence, and to make new lives over the border. This first wave of Refugees from the borderlands was followed soon by countless more coming from the rest of America. While at first they were met with RCMP Officers in Dress Uniforms, and friendly locals greeting them with Tim Hortons Coffee and Donuts, 20 years of unchecked migration has worn thin on most Canadians. While the shared cultural and linguistic links with the US has allowed many Refugees to easily assimilate, many, especially in Quebec, have grown weary of the Americans, and have played into fears that the American Refugees are 'erasing' our Canadian identity. While a larger population has many benefits, especially to our thinly-spread military, there is a general feeling that the American Refugees have overstayed their welcome, leading to a prevailing increase in xenophobic rhetoric towards our Southern neighbors.

 CAN_housing_crunch:0 "Housing Crunch"
 CAN_housing_crunch_desc:0 "While Canada may be vast, only a small portion of our mighty nation is actually inhabited. The slim amount of usable land for housing, combined by a myriad of other factors such as Municipal, Provincial and Federal regulation, the presence of foreign investors, and a rapidly growing population, has made housing prices soar uncontrollably. While lucrative for the Real Estate industry, the unfriendly housing market has made it virtually impossible for average working families to afford homes. Indeed, most of our nation's young have given up any hope of home ownership, and have resorted to increasingly frugal means to keep roofs over their heads. Unless we can control our sharply rising housing prices, it seems as if the best many Canadians can hope for is living in a van down by the river."
 
 CAN_backbench_revolt:0 "Backbencher Revolt"
 CAN_backbench_revolt_desc:0 "Despite the Progressive Conservatives restoring their control of Canada's right, there is still a dedicated contingent of Reform Party Loyalists who refuse to cooperate with Prime Minister Manning. While the Reform Party does collaborate with the PCs, their Caucus is an rowdy and often uncontrollable entity, often attracting members far outside of the reasonable Canadian political spectrum. Prime Minister Manning has done his best to alleviate this, and has had some success in attempts to form a united Conservative front; and while the Reform Party is open to this, there are still many radicals within the Reform Party who bitterly resist any attempts at reconciliation.

 CAN_chalk_river_labs:0 "Chalk River Labs"
 CAN_chalk_river_labs_desc:0 "Nuclear Power is a defining factor in whether nations can be considered Great Powers. While Canada thus far lacks a Nuclear Arsenal, we do possess the raw power and technology needed to enrich Uranium, and the knowhow to construct a functioning arsenal. Despite our aces to Nuclear Secrets, Canada seems content in remaining disarmed, using our nuclear prowess for energy instead of warfare.\n\n The US Nuclear Arsenal, long fallen into disrepair, now lies split between the US Breakaways, with many silos concentrated in the Ultranationalist-controlled territories of Montana and Idaho. While we are willing to tolerate the existence of these 'nations', any sense of a nuclear-threat in the former US, especially by radical regimes, would lead to a swift and deadly Canadian response.\n\n With a large supply of former American Scientists, and access to the nuclear secrets of the old America, it is clear Canada possesses the means to make our own Arsenal; only time will tell if we can justify the ends.

 ### Political ###
 
 CAN_prime_minister_manning:0 "Prime Minister Manning"
 CAN_prime_minister_manning_desc:0 "Putting an end to the Premiership of the NDP's Bob Rae in 2008, Preston Manning has been the first Conservative Prime Minister of Canada since Brian Mulroney, and on paper has won control of Canada’s diverse Conservative political scene. In practice however, Manning’s Rightwing Bloc is fat from unite, with cracks within his own party beginning to show. While we hope for the best, there are many within the party who fear that the events of 1989 may soon repeat under Manning’s watch..."
 CAN_harpers_folly:0 "Harper's Folly"
 CAN_harpers_folly_desc:0 "The Reform Party is a shadow of its former self, with its death knell being decisively rung when its founder left to join the PCs. While the ProgCons have been thus far content with allowing them to exist, the simple fact is that the Rightwing in Canada can not survive while divided. For the good of our ideology, we must put aside our differences with the Reformites. Prime Minister Manning shall arrange a leader with Stephen Harper, and begin the process to end the division among Canada’s Right."
 CAN_pander_to_reformites:0 "Pander to Reformites"
 CAN_pander_to_reformites_desc:0 "While the Reform Party is a thing of a past, the allignment over their former voters is far but certain. To help keep Conservative voters with the PCs, we shall begin implementing policies friendly to the Reform Party, and allow Reform Members to take prominent places in the cabinent."
 CAN_focus_on_alberta:0 "Focus on Alberta"
 CAN_focus_on_alberta_desc:0 "The results of the 2010 by-elections have revealed a grim lack of attention paid to the Prairie Provinces. Gains made by the Liberals and the NDP in Alberta have alerted us to the possibility of facing catastrophic losses in the region. With this in mind, we shall pay special attention to Alberta and the Prairie Provinces in the next Election, and appealing to blue collar and lower class voters."
 CAN_allign_fiscal_conservatives:0 "Allign Fiscal Conservatives"
 CAN_allign_fiscal_conservatives_desc:0 "While we espouse a certain brand of populism, in all practical terms our party remains more favorable to business interests than the interests of the common man. While some wish to shift our rhetoric to match that of the late Reform Party, we know that staying true to the original Progressive Conservative brand is the way forward."
 CAN_focus_on_ontario:0 "Focus on Ontario"
 CAN_focus_on_ontario_desc:0 "We can do without the votes from some hillbillies in Western Canada; but the votes we have gained from Ontario's wealthy business communities are some we simply can’t go without. Our focus of attention in the next Election shall be centered around Ontario, especially the lofty and well-connected émigrés who have settled around the Toronto area."
 CAN_rehabilitate_mulroney:0 "Rehabilitate the Free Trade Legacy"
 CAN_rehabilitate_mulroney_desc:0 "Brian Mulroney's efforts to establish a truly international Canada could not have come at a worse time. His plans to establish free and fair trade were killed on the same day America was, and in 1989, the Progressive Conservatives as a party nearly suffered the same fate. Although protectionists in our own party and Turnerite Liberals may jump at us, Mulroney's dream must return."
 CAN_2010_democratic_league_review:0 "2010 Democratic League Summit"
 CAN_2010_democratic_league_review_desc:0 "Held off-and-on every one to two years, the summits of the Democratic League provide important opportunities for members to discuss resolutions and put forward policy. This most recent summit, to be held in Sydney, is set to be one of the most energetic yet. The Democratic League is faced with a changing world; a changing world we may be able to play a much bigger part in."
 CAN_british_ties:0 "Repair our Relationship with the British"
 CAN_british_ties_desc:0 "Our relationship with Britain has been frosty ever since they refused our proposal to join the reorganized NATO. Content to sit on their isle and ignore the world, the British don't seem to pay us much mind anymore. Seeking to change this, Prime Minister [CAN.GetLeader] has sent a diplomatic mission to London, a gesture which will hopefully open up the channels with the British once more."
 CAN_our_dependencies:0 "Support our Dependencies"
 CAN_our_dependencies_desc:0 "Alaska and Greenland, on account of their barren physical habitats, are almost entirely reliant on Canada for food and vital supplies. This situation has led to them being dubbed as Canada's 'dependencies', entities which are independent in a technical sense, but are in all practical terms completely reliant on Canada. This arrangement, while beneficial, is cause for a fair amount of bitterness on their end. It is in our best interest to help alleviate this, and help Alaska and Greenland live up to their full potential."
 CAN_attack_the_liberals:0 "Red/Orange Scare"
 CAN_attack_the_liberals_desc:0 "The Liberals and the NDP have been hard at work opposing everything our government does. Despite all that the PCs have done, the opposition has found sucsess at swaying voters away from our cause. We must remind our voters of the tragic tales of the Rae and Martin governments, as a warning of what happens under when the opposition is allowed to take power. "
 CAN_play_into_anti_american_fears:0 "Play into Anti-Migrant Rhetoric"
 CAN_play_into_anti_american_fears_desc:0 "There is a certain feeling among particularly jingoistic Canadians that the countless Americans who have come to call Canada home have overstayed their welcome. While the PCs of old praised these American migrants as an industrious and hard working people, the new PCs realize that they can score some badly needed political points by rallying against them."
 CAN_manning_doctrine:0 "The [GetCanPCLeaderShortHand] Strategy"
 CAN_manning_doctrine_desc:0 "The next election is right around the corner, and party insiders have unveiled their plan to lead the PCs to decisive victory. With the Liberals and NDP mobilizing their base, it is clear that 2011 is going to be one of the most hard-fought elections in recent memory. Can the Progressive Conservatives defend their majority? Or will they meet the same fate that the Mulroney Government met in 1989?"
 
 CAN_decision_2011:0 "Decision: 2011"
 CAN_decision_2011_desc:0 "The 2011 Federal Elections have just been held, and Canadians are finished leaving the polls after electing their new representatives. As the polls close, the Canadian people chew their nails and wonder if they will have a new government come morning"
 
 CAN_pc_victory:0 "The Progressive Conservatives"
 CAN_pc_victory_desc:0 "A shocking result to some, the expected outcome to others. Regardless, the PCs have managed to maintain their hold on power. While not nearly as powerful as they were once elected, the voters of Canada have made it clear that they believe the Tories are still worthy enough to compose Canada's government."
 CAN_ndp_victory:0 "The New Democratic Party"
 CAN_ndp_victory_desc:0 "As it turns out, the Conservatives were unable to survive the tumult that plagued their Government since day 1. In their place, the New Democratic Party rises as Canada's ruling party once more. While divided between the Moderate Socialists of Jack Layton and Democratic Liberals of Bob Rae, the NDP remains a coherent entity dedicated to the progress of Canada."
 CAN_liberal_victory:0 "The Liberals"
 CAN_liberal_victory_desc:0 "In a surprising upset, the Liberals, long thought to be a spent force in Canadian Politics, have managed to outpace both the Progressive Conservatives and their ideological counterparts in the NDP. Now that it's clear that the NDP are not about to outpace the Liberals as the force representing Canada's left, the Liberals can begin implementing their agenda, and undoing the years of damage done under the PCs."
 
 CAN_prime_minister_trump:0 "Prime Minister Trump"
 CAN_prime_minister_trump_desc:0 "A wildly unexpected outcome to anyone not versed in Canadian politics, the victory of American exile Donald John Trump signals a new era for Canada, and for Democracy in the new world. While denounced as a virulent authoritarian and epitome of American privilege by some, others hold Trump up as a herald of prosperity, success and business prowess, and the perfect choice for Canada in her new era as leader of the free world."
 CAN_codify_trumpism:0 "Codify Trumpism"
 CAN_codify_trumpism_desc:0 "When Trump first announced his run for PC leadership he had little in the way of domestic or social policy, opting simply to run on a series of broad economic promises. Now that Trump has been swept into power, a concrete strategy is needed going forward."
 CAN_discourage_reformites:0 "Discourage Reformites"
 CAN_discourage_reformites_desc:0 "Harper, Cruz and their little band of Albertan Rednecks still think they can control the PCs despite being hostile to everything the party believes in.

 CAN_continue_ontario_partnership_desc:0 "Ontario is Canada's shining beacon of prosperity, a gleaming center of finance and industry that is about as close to the Old New York that you can get. As a native resident of Toronto deeply entwined with the Ontario political scene, Trump has used his ties to aid him in crafting the policies of his government.

Trump, still veiwed with suspicion by much of the Canadian populace, has sought to reinvigorate Canadian patriotism, instilling in this meek people the value of loving their country and sheding his past asociation as an emigré.

Indeed, many have accused Rae of being a crypto-liberal, who's loyalty to the NDP cause only extends out of brazen opportunism.

 CAN_prime_minister_ignatieff_desc:0 "Michael Ignatieff is many things; an author, and academic, and a notable television and radio broadcaster, and now, Canada's 29th Prime Minister. While viewed by the common public as 'bland', Ignatieff's no-nonsense and common sense style of government is just what the nation needs at a time like this. It's time for a government that puts substance over flash!"
 CAN_the_lesser_evil:0 "The Lesser Evil"
 CAN_the_lesser_evil_desc:0 "We find ourselves in an unprecedented age in global politics, an age where danger no longer lurks in the corner, but hides in familiar faces. The subject of how to balance our liberal democracies with the ever present need for security is a common point of contention for the Ignatieff government, who has increasingly opened up to the policy of suspending certain civil liberties in the name of protecting our country. While this may be unacceptable to some, we have to accept that sometimes our need for security is greater than our need for liberty."
 CAN_legacy_of_martin:0 "Martin's Legacy"

 CAN_right_liberalism:0 "Right-Liberalism"
 CAN_right_liberalism_desc:0 "Paul Martin has made it clear that his fatal undoing wasn't that he didn't pander enough to the left. Far from it indeed, the reason why the Liberals were faced with such catastrophic losses is we gravitated too far from the right. There's already a party for hippies and socialists and it's called the NDP; we’re the Liberals, so let's commit to Liberalism."
 CAN_legacy_of_chretien:0 "Chrétien's Legacy"
 CAN_legacy_of_chretien_desc:0 "Jean Chrétien, the last Liberal Prime Minister since Ignatieff, is a polarizing figure. While beloved by many, his tenure was cut short by disagreements within his own party. While his tenure was short, it was also impactful, paving the way for some of Canada's most impactful legislation. Perhaps we should consult this veteran Liberal for advice on governing Canada?"
 CAN_social_liberal_coalition:0 "A Coalition of the Left"
 CAN_social_liberal_coalition_desc:0 "It has become clear to us that the devastating losses inflicted in recent years to the Liberals were not as a result of our party going too far left.

 CAN_no_more_scandals:0 "No More Scandals"
 CAN_no_more_scandals_desc:0 "Perhaps the most influential factor that contributed to the Liberals 20 year long slump was the fact that the party was almost constantly gripped by scandals. Exemplified during the Martin Years, these scandals gave the people of Canada the wrong image about our party, and gave our voters a carte blanche to flock to the NDP en masse. Luckily, the Ignatieff Government has done its best to clean the unsavory image of our party that has been painted throughout the years."

While some may be more concerned with results than ideals, here in Canada we have been given a unique opportunity to look inward, ask the tough questions.

Politicians in the past have failed to realize that Canada has been shouldered the responsibility as leader of the Free World, still living in the days of Canada as a mere middle power.

 CAN_accepting_refugees_desc:0 "We need every able-bodied man and woman we can get for the coming struggle against Soviet Communism. While Canada historically has had a scarce populace drawn from to fight conflicts, the terror across from our Southern Border has provided Canada with a constant stream of recruitable population for future conflicts. Trudeau, both compassionate and realistic, has embarked on a program which will provide the young and vulnerable a pathway to integration in Canadian Society, and the military-ready Canadian Citizenship in exchange for mandatory military service. After all, Service Guarantees Citizenship."
 CAN_concede_to_centrists:0 "Concede to the Establishment"
 CAN_concede_to_centrists_desc:0 "We have to be realistic about our ambitions; while Trudeau is a great reformer, he is also a realist who acknowledges where our party base lies.

With that in mind, Trudeau has announced that the wills of liberal-conservatives and pragmatists within the party will not hold him back, and that changes that could best be described as 'radical' are coming to Canada in the near future. This rapid shift, while alienating many Liberal voters, would secure any potential NDP support for the Liberal Government."

 CAN_trudeaumania_desc:0 "Trudeaumania was a term used to describe the excitement generated by Pierre Trudeau during his first few terms as Prime Minister. While the days of the original 'Trudeaumania' are long behind us, the younger Trudeau's allure has captured the nation once more, as the people of Canada fawn over their charismatic new leader. Like the Trudeaumania of old, this general feeling is likely to fade, but for now, Justin Trudeau can bask in leadership of a nation dazzled by his charm and good looks."

As a domestic Canadian company with a sizable market share, we shall help them stay afloat in the cutthroat world of Canadian business; either by bailing them out, awarding them favorable contracts, or intervening in possible legal matters. While some may denounce this as corrupt, we realize it's a necessary evil to keep Canadian business afloat."

 CAN_bloc_quebecios_victory:0 "Triumph of the Bloc"
 CAN_bloc_quebecios_victory_desc:0 "The Bloc Québécois has achieved victory in the 2015 Federal Election... somehow? This shocking result has come about as a result of the BQ's unprecedented success and a complete failure of the remaining political establishment; something which has given the Bloc enough seats to form a minority government. As the dust settles, Canada's newfound ruling party must decide what their path forward will be, and what will come out of this extraordinary situation."
 CAN_quebec_issues_first:0 "Put Quebec Issues First"
 CAN_quebec_issues_first_desc:0 "The Bloc is unapologetically a party dedicated to Quebec issues, tabling issues important to Quebec exclusively.

 CAN_democratie_sociale:0 "Social-Démocratie"
 CAN_democratie_sociale_desc:0 "In addition to advocating for Quebec issues, the Bloc is also a party which holds roots in Social-Democratic and Democratic Socialist movement both within Quebec and across Canada. While the NDP has held most of Canada's Labour-Left votes, the Bloc and the NDP have differed, of course, in the fact that the BQ is a Quebec regional party. Now that we are Canada's governing party, we can help sway the left-leaning vote, and continue our advocating for a true Canadian-Québécois Social Democracy."
 CAN_le_un_terme:0 "Le Seul Terme"
 CAN_le_un_terme_desc:0 "It is obvious that the Bloc's victory in 2015 was nothing more than a freak twist of fate, and one that is not likely to be repeated any time soon.

 CAN_establish_lasting_connections:0 "Establish Lasting Connections"
 CAN_establish_lasting_connections_desc:0 "The unprecedented victory of the Bloc has telegraphed to all major parties that the will of Quebec is nothing to ignore. Now, practically every major party can not stop pandering to the Quebec vote, and has scrambled to ensure the potential loyalty of the Bloc in a minority government situation. This has untold benefits for the BQ and Quebec, as we can reliably extort the establishment for political influence."
 CAN_rethink_our_independence_positions:0 "Rethinking our Independence Position"
 CAN_rethink_our_independence_positions_desc:0 "The victory of the Bloc has invariably shattered the current paradigm of Canadian politics in regards to Quebec. The fact that the entire Canadian establishment is in a rush to pander to French-Canadians has allowed Quebec to gain untold influence within Canada, influence which has paved the foundation for a more equal Canada. Now that Anglo and Francophone Canadians are on more equal terms, many have begun to question the merits of potential Québécois independence, and our party's already unclear stance on the issue."
 CAN_bloc_rebranding:0 "Rebrand the Bloc"
 CAN_bloc_rebranding_desc:0 "The shock victory of the Bloc on a federal level has made many question the merits of the BQ as a purely regional party. Our success in 2015 has proven that we can be more than simply a party advocating for Quebec issues, and can spread out to aid all Canadians. Thus, the Bloc shall move away from its policy of Quebec regionalism, and will shift to being a major party in its own right, and run candidates outside of Quebec."

 CAN_nationwide_secularism_law:0 "Nationwide Secularism Law"
 CAN_nationwide_secularism_law_desc:0 "One notable issue pushed by the Bloc and the Québécois government is the so-called 'Secularism Law', which prohibits certain Federal employees from wearing Religious items. This focus on secularism dates back to the so-called 'Quiet Revolution', where Quebec Citizens broke from the heavily Catholic traditions of the Dupleiss Government, and instituted strictly secular policies.

Behind him is a slim minority government hindered at every step by a loose-knit coalition of establishment parties who have threatened the Cruz premiership at every turn.

 CAN_prime_minister_kenney_desc:0 "As it turns out, Ralph Cruz was more dedicated to complaining about the PCs than providing a legitimate alternative. Thus, Cruz has vanished, seemingly from the face of the earth in the moment when his party needed him most. In his place rises Jason Kenney, a former PC loyalist who defected to the Canadian Alliance after the collapse of the ProgCon poll numbers. Now rising as Prime Minister, Kenney stands behind a loose coalition with the Progressive Conservatives, who are faced with an internal crisis over the party's new direction."

As it seems, the CA is poised to overtake the ProgCons just as the Reform Party sought to overtake the PCs in the 90's. This time, of course, the Canadian Alliance has actually managed to edge out a win instead of eternally sitting in opposition. Some have called for a second merger, this time on our terms, while others favor the Canadian Alliance remaining as an independent right-wing force, much like the NDP is to the Liberals."

While previous governments have allowed this to occur, the Kenney Government is determined to shape Canada as a clean, moral, and outwardly Christian nation.

Years of Labour-centric policy by Jack Layton and his allies has cemented Canada's status as the New World's beacon of left-wing democracy.

As nearly the entire nation, including his political enemies, comes together to mourn the loss of Canada's most beloved politician, Layton's friends, family and supporters band together and throw their confidence behind a new face. While ultimately defined by Layton's shadow, this new NDP leader will make sure that the spirit of this beloved statesman will always live on."
 CAN_laytons_sucsessor_desc_2:0 "Layton, while surviving his lengthy battle with cancer, has ultimately grown too frail to maintain leadership of a major political party. The NDP, now in a vacuum, will look within their own ranks to select a leader to follow Layton.

 rw_canada.1.t:0 "The New Leader of the Free World"
 rw_canada.1.d:0 "Canada was once a backbencher in the realm of global politics, a second rate middle power subservient to the United States in every way. While we were content with our place, everything would change following the collapse of the United States in 1987. America's fall shook the roots of our foreign and domestic policy to its core; and as the remains of what was once America convulsed, a near-endless stream of desperate Americans heading towards Canada's borders. And if things couldn't get worse, the rest of our NATO allies either refused the call to protect Global Democracy, or themselves fell to the ravenous Communists.\n\n 20 years later, Canada is left as one of the world's last democracies, stranded along with the other shards of freedom in this Red World. Heralding what's left of NATO, Canada fights a seemingly hopeless fight against Soviet Hegemony; determined above all to avenge their fallen brothers to the South and restore freedom's bright gleam to a world darkened by Communism."

 rw_canada.2.t:0 "The Delicate Balance"
 rw_canada.2.d:0 "It would come as quite the shock to many that Preston Manning, once the sworn enemy of the out-of-touch Progressive Conservatives, would eventually come to lead them. The ProgCons today are the main force representing Canada's right, however this was not always the case. During the 1990s it seemed apparent that the Progressive Conservatives were doomed, condemned to irrelevance by their Western Canada oriented opposition in the Reform Party. While they managed to fend off irrelevance by cooperating with the Liberals, the Reform Party consistently managed to outshine the PCs in every area. However this trajectory would not remain, as the PCs would find themselves rebounding in the mid 2000s. In the wake of the PC resurgence, and the growing calls for a united Canadian Conservative Party in the form of the 'Unite the Right' movement, Preston Manning, once a staunch opponent of the PCs, agreed to dissolve the Reform Party and endure the ProgCons.\n\n This decision however was not universal, as vast swaths of the Reform Party continued to act as an independent entity, and found a new leader in the form of Stephen Harper, who denounced both Manning and his populist direction. While the Reform Party is broadly cooperative towards the Progressive Conservatives, their increasing bend towards defiance has many PC insiders worried. With Manning now Prime Minister, there are many who guess that a formal merger between the two parties may soon be in order. All that's needed to get things in motion is a catalyst..."

 rw_canada.3.t:0 "The New Decade's Economic Report"
 rw_canada.3.d:0 "The wake of the USA's collapse had catastrophic effects on Canada's economy, to say the least. While the loss of billions of dollars in commerce came as no surprise, what did come as a somewhat pleasant surprise was the relocation of American finance and business to the Great White North. The loss of many major trade hubs and centers of Commerce sent American money flocking. The obvious place to set up shop was Canada's, a nation in close proximity which possessed relative isolation from Communist threats. Additionally, Canada shared much of the same linguistic and cultural infrastructure of the old United States, allowing the 'emigrés' to adapt quickly to their new lives in Canada. 20 years later, Canada's economy has flourished, allowing Canada to establish itself as the unquestioned center of Global Commerce. With the Soviets stagnating and the Chinese struggling to break into international markets, Canada can safely boast about having the world's strongest economy. While there have undoubtedly been downsides to this arrangement with American Business, namely appalling corruption, Canada can thrive as an international hub of prosperity and economic safety. From Vancouver to Montreal, from Halifax to Calgary, Canada's business is business."

 rw_canada.4.d:0 "Prominent Businessman and former member of the Toronto City Council, Donald Trump has officially tendered his resignation from the Senate of Canada. An influential figure within the Canadian political scene, Trump has thus far been content managing his many enterprises and quietly supporting the Progressive Conservatives. Despite being a personal friend of Pierre Trudeau near the end of his life, Trump has remained a strong supporter of the Progressive Conservatives; often providing them with generous donations of campaign funds. After a brief stint on the Toronto City Council, and a failed run for Mayor of Toronto in 2000, Trump has sought to remain quiet in the realm of politics, and since has only accepted a nomination to the generally apolitical Canadian Senate.\n\n Trump's appointment caused a small controversy, as some accused the PCs of appointing Trump due to his lofty contributions to the Conservative campaign; while Prime Minister Manning maintained that Trump was appointed due to his business expertise, and as a reward for his decades of service to the Canadian Economy. The resignation of Senator Trump to many is a sign that Trump is back at it again, and is moving to become more involved in the Canadian political scene. Prominent whispers surrounding Trump have pointed to a possible Parliamentary run, most likely as a shoo-in in the district of Etobicoke Centre, one of the few PC seats in the Greater Toronto Area. "

 rw_canada.5.d:0 "The Member of Parliament for Calgary Nose Hill, Rafael Edward Cruz has made the papers today for a string of comments made regarding the Reform Party's relationship with the Progressive Conservatives. The Reform Party, while on paper an independent political entity, is heavily aligned with the PCs and are known to collaborate with them on several hot-button legislative issues. This de-facto coalition is a particularly contentious issue for Cruz, who has denounced both the PCs and any attempts by the Reform Party to work with them. According to Cruz, the Progressive Conservatives have sold out the core tenets of Conservatism, and have increasingly given way to psuedo-Socialist and proto-Liberal politics, and are no longer reliable as a right-wing party. Additionally, Cruz has rejected the concept of 'Strategic Voting', stating that a NDP or Liberal Victory would be preferable to a PC one because the Liberals and NDP are at least 'Honest about their intentions'.\n\n This increasing pattern of Reform disloyalty is a large contributing factor to the increasingly grim forecast for our next by-elections, as Reform candidates often attack Conservatives more than they attack their left-wing opponents."

 rw_canada.6.d:0 "Leader of the renegade arm of the Reform Party, Stephen Harper, has today met with his compatriot in the Progressive Conservative Party, Preston Manning. Manning and Harper have a long and storied history together, starting when they were both members of the old Reform Party, and ending when Manning dissolved the party to rejoin the PCs. Ever since, relations between Harper and Manning have been strained, with Harper often lending confidence to the PC Government in exchange for certain political concessions. However, this situation seems to be gearing up for a change, as Manning and Harper have begun moving to formally end the PC-Reform divide, and bring the mutinous faction back into the PC fold. Whether Manning will succeed in this endeavor is anyone's guess; but for now, it seems as if Harper is in agreement with Manning's conclusions. "

 rw_canada.7.t:0 "The Reform Party to merge with the Progressive Conservatives"
 rw_canada.7.d:0 "In a significant turn of events in Canadian politics, the Reform Party of Canada has recently announced its decision to merge with the Progressive Conservatives. This move, aimed at consolidating conservative strength and influence in the current political climate, represents a major shift in the country's political dynamics. Leaders from both parties have emphasized the need for unity to present a robust challenge to the Liberals and the NDP, acknowledging that a fragmented conservative front has diminished their collective impact in recent elections. This strategic fusion, while widely supported by those advocating for a stronger opposition, has also stirred debate among party members concerned about preserving their distinct ideologies and policies. This merger marks a crucial moment in Canadian politics, heralding a potential reshaping of the national political landscape and indicating the onset of a new chapter in the country's political narrative."

 rw_canada.8.t:0 "Cruz Denounces the Merger"
 rw_canada.8.d:0 "Rafael Edward Cruz, the Member of Parliament for Calgary Nose Hill, has emerged as a vocal critic of the recent merger between the Reform Party and the Progressive Conservatives. This union, aimed at consolidating conservative forces within Canadian politics, has sparked intense debate across the political spectrum. Cruz, known for his staunch advocacy for core Reform Party principles, views this merger as a dilution of the party's foundational values. He articulates his concerns with a fervor that resonates with many party loyalists, arguing that the merger compromises the distinct identity and ideological purity that the Reform Party has long championed. His denunciation is not just a critique of the merger but an impassioned plea for the preservation of the party's unique political legacy.\n\n In public forums and the halls of Parliament, Cruz has been forthright in expressing his disapproval, warning that this blending of parties risks alienating the grassroots supporters who have been the backbone of the Reform Party's strength. He contends that the merger represents a capitulation to political expediency over principle, a move that could erode the trust and support of the party's base. Despite facing opposition from those in favor of the merger, Cruz's stance has struck a chord with a significant faction within the party, igniting a robust internal debate about the future direction of conservative politics in Canada. His position underscores a deep-seated tension within the party, reflecting the broader challenges of balancing ideological integrity with the pragmatic demands of political unification."

Cruz, along with a handful of particularly rabid Reform loyalists, have officially moved to leave the Progressive Conservative caucus, and form their own party dedicated to the ideals espoused by the former Reform Party. This party, named the 'Canadian Alliance', is dedicated to Conservatism in both an economic and social sense, and has promised to undo the decades of Social Reform advanced under the Rae and Chrétien Governments. This party has been described as 'Fascistic' by some, and is without a doubt the most radical player on the organized Canadian political scene. While this party is unlikely to gain significant power any time soon, the exodus of several Conservative MPs to a new political player has many within the Progressive Conservatives particularly worried."

While a newer face, Poilievre has already made a name for himself as the Tories' designated 'Attack Dog'. Among the youngest MPs in Parliament, Poilievre's status as Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister has gained him widespread fame both within the PC caucus and across Canada. A fierce and uncompromising figure, Poilievre has already made his fair share of enemies through a series of gutsy attacks and public stunts, all aimed at riling up the PC base. Most notably, Poilievre has become a frequent critic of the way Canada conducts elections, and has proposed several changes to the way Canadians vote; mainly the elimination of the vouching system. The proposed addendums garnered opposition across both Canada and the world's remaining democracies, leading Poilievre to attack the chief electoral office of Elections Canada, stating that they want 'more power, a bigger budget and less accountability'.\n\n Poilievre, while strengthening the PC's image as a party not afraid to fight the good fight, has also garnered a significant amount of criticism for his more 'questionable' comments. In light of his status as both a blessing and a curse, many within the party have urged Manning to keep Poilievre on a tighter leash."

According to Trump, the opening of Canada's markets to foreign goods threatens the Canadian economy and puts Canada's already fragile job market at risk. Trump has instead come out strongly in favour of protectionist policies which would defend domestic business against foreign competition with a system of high tariffs.\n\n This vocal attack has once more put Donald Trump in the spotlight. Trump himself, while quite comfortable in the PC caucus, has been more and more vocal about his distrust of Manning's new direction and association with the Reform Party. Indeed, Trump has frequently attacked the Reform Party's on many issues, particularly Stephen Harper's approach to Social Conservatism. Trump fancies himself as something of an Economic Conservative with Liberal social attitudes, a stance which has not sat well with much of PC's new Prairie-based electorate. This clash between the Ontario real-estate mogul and the Prime Minister is one more furthering of the already strenuous regional divide within the PC party."

On the Provincial level, the Fords are the main Conservative opposition to Liberal Premier Dalton McGuinty, as well as on the Municipal level, where Liberals such as Joe Pantalone and David Miller still hold influence over Toronto Politics.

The loss of a party leader's seat is an unprecedented occurrence in Canadian Politics, having not happened since Brian Mulroney lost his own seat after the PC's devastating losses in the 1989 elections. The loss of the Canadian Alliance's only seat in Parliament is a very grim sign for the party, as most polls forecast that the CA will fail to pick up even a single seat next election.

The remaining CA loyalists appear to be staying only out of loyalty to Cruz, or because they have burned too many bridges with the PCs.\n\n While the few remnants of the party hoped that Cruz would keep up the good fight, Cruz had officially dissolved the party, citing a critical inability to find candidates to run in subsequent elections. With Cruz gone, the few sordid remains of the party have either returned to the ProgCons, or have switched to voting for a more radical right-wing force.\n\n Cruz has announced that he will not be seeking election again, and has signaled his intention to return to private life."

The NDP, once the official political arm of the Canadian Labour Congress, has begun working to fix this glaring issue, and have been hard at work tearing down the vestiges of our remaining anti-union legislation, as well as drafting our very own anti-scab legislation to ensure that Canada's workers can safely go on strike without fear of losing their jobs.\n\n While some have denounced this as a gateway to Canada's very own Bolshevik Revolution, the NDP says that a fairly represented worker is the best way to keep Labour conflicts from turning violent.

This meeting, emblematic of the party's gradual drift towards more center-right policies, marks a pivotal moment in its ideological trajectory. Michael Ignatieff, a figure who has been at the forefront of this subtle yet discernible shift, engaged in extensive discussions with Martin, whose tenure as Prime Minister was characterized by fiscally conservative policies that left an indelible mark on the party's economic approach. This rendezvous between past and present leadership is seen as a confluence of ideas aimed at redefining the Liberal Party’s stance, particularly in areas of economic management and social policy.\n\n The convergence of Ignatieff's contemporary vision with Martin's legacy is indicative of the party's adaptation to the changing political landscape of Canada. Under Ignatieff's guidance, the Liberals are increasingly embracing policies that lean towards fiscal prudence, balanced budgets, and market-friendly strategies, a departure from their traditionally more centrist, if not center-left, positioning. This ideological realignment, while drawing some criticism from the party's traditional base, is also seen as a strategic move to capture a broader electorate, particularly in the face of rising challenges from both the left and the right of the political spectrum. The meeting between Ignatieff and Martin, thus, is not just a mere gathering of party luminaries but a symbol of the Liberal Party's evolving ethos, reflecting a pragmatic approach to governance and policy-making in the complex and ever-changing realm of Canadian politics."

 rw_canada.92.d:0 "A significant defection has now rocked the government as Bob Rae, former NDP leader and Prime Minister, has officially joined the Liberal Party, taking with him a considerable number of moderate NDP members. Rae has stated that his decision to leave the NDP was driven by the party's leftward direction, and was a result of the increasing conflict with Layton's branch of the party. Openly expressing reserved disgruntlement until the final moment, the NDP has now been left in a state of disarray, as countless more 'moderate' NDP voters also join Rae's exodus. While the NDP has stated that Rae's leaving was a mutual decision, in secret the defection of Rae was years in the making, with a common remark within the NDP being that Rae would have joined the Liberals long ago if their poll numbers were better. Rae's break with the NDP was made inevitable after Michael Ignatieff (Rae's former College Roommate) became Prime Minister; putting the Liberals back in the spotlight and firmly establishing the Liberals once more as the unquestioned force of Canada's center-left."

Rather, it has been a result of years of reckless social-liberalism driving right-leaning voters into the arms of the PCs. The Party under Ignatieff now seeks to remedy this, and give those on Canada's right a moderate alternative to the Progressive Conservatives. The Progressive Conservatives, while claiming to be a moderate party, have been rotted from the inside by radical Reform Party Loyalists, and are now nothing but a gaggle of ill-educated reactionaries. The Liberals, long scorned by Canada's right, will now embrace a steady form of Liberal Conservatism, which can hopefully allow them to appeal to both Left-Wing and Right-Wing voters.\n\n Of course, this direction is heavily frowned upon by Social Liberals within the party, who have been engaged in a backbench revolt as a result. Manning this revolt is Justin Trudeau, son of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, who has denounced Ignatieff's direction as betraying the Liberal brand and opening up the party to reactionary infiltration, damning the Liberals to the same fate which befell the PCs.

 rw_canada.94.d:0 "In a politically charged and symbolic meeting, Prime Minister Jean Chrétien sat down with his successor, Michael Ignatieff, in a gathering that has been widely interpreted as a nod towards the Canadian Liberal Party's shift to the left. This rendezvous, bringing together two pivotal figures of Canadian politics, underscores a significant ideological recalibration within the party. Chrétien, known for his charismatic leadership and centrist policies, engaged in profound discussions with Ignatieff, who himself had navigated the complexities of economic and social reforms during his tenure. This meeting represents a confluence of ideas, symbolizing the party's increasing inclination towards progressive policies and social welfare agendas.\n\nThe convergence of Chrétien's complicated legacy with Ignatieff's insights reflects the Liberal Party's response to the evolving demands of Canadian society. Under Chrétien's influence, the Liberals appear to be embracing a more socially conscious approach, prioritizing healthcare, environmental stewardship, and inclusive social policies. This shift is seen as an attempt to realign the party with the needs and aspirations of a broader demographic, particularly younger voters and those concerned with social justice issues. The engagement between these two leaders, with their rich history in the party's evolution, is emblematic of the Liberals' commitment to progressive values. This move, while potentially alienating some of the party's more fiscally conservative supporters, is a strategic effort to reestablish the Liberals as a champion of left-leaning ideals, reflecting a renewed focus on addressing the challenges of inequality and climate change in the contemporary Canadian political landscape."

This strategy has had some success, with many Rae supporters coming to the aid of the Liberals after becoming alienated with the NDP's leftward direction.\n\n This new direction of the party has had broad support within the higher echelons of the party, as many feel that the collapse of the party in the early 2000s was a result of the party's abandonment of their left-wing founding principles. Of course, there are still business oriented minds, mostly coalesced around former Prime Minister Paul Martin, who view this new direction as dangerous and liable to alienate those who seek an alternative to the Tories.

Others however have dampened these worries, stating that the votes lost in Western Canada can be more than made up by the votes gained in Ontario and Atlantic Canada by our party's new direction. "

While [CAN.GetLeader] has stated that they are open to a second term if they manage to pull off another victory, they have decided that pulling off the impossible once more is not within the legitimate aspirations of the party.

Indeed, it seemed that few were willing to risk the integrity of the Canadian nation in the wake of the collapse of the United States. While the broad concept of 'Sovereignty' has been a popular proposition, 'Independence' has remained a dirty word in Canadian politics ever since 1995. The attachment to pro-independence ideals starkly divided the Bloc Québécois, and led to an almost 20-year slump in party popularity which we are only now recovering from. The fact that the BQ managed to win a majority of Quebec seats appeared to be as a result of the BQ's increasingly unclear stance on Quebec independence, with a broad shift occurring from 'Independence' to 'Autonomy'(even if particularly determined figures still push for Independence from the rest of Canada). Of course, since the BQ now has a powerful amount of sway in Canadian politics, the party has sought to ditch any such affiliations with independence movements and instead focus on using the Bloc's leverage as a bargaining chip to help the rest of the political establishment focus on Quebec issues."

This sudden focus on victory on the federal level has led many to wonder if the BQ plans to expand their scope beyond Quebec, perhaps even running candidates in certain French-speaking areas in Ontario and New Brunswick. This new direction would give the BQ more breathing room in federal affairs, and potentially give them enough leeway to govern without NDP or Liberal backing. Of course, while the idea of a BQ majority government is beyond reasonable consideration, running more candidates could do enough to pad the predicted losses for the BQ, and allow the margin of error for Bloc seats to extend beyond a few seats."

This new Federal Party has completely divorced itself from any ideals of Québecois independence, and has instead declared a focus on Canadian Unity, bilingualism, and improved Francophone-Anglophone relations. With this new tonal shift, the Bloc has announced their intention to run candidates across Canada. This new attempt by the Bloc to break into the Anglophone political scene has mixed reactions. Most Canadians find the idea of the Bloc running candidates in English Canada as laughable, and analysts are skeptical about the Bloc's ability to win even a single seat outside of Quebec. Despite this, there is still a large voting base for this new 'Canadian Bloc' across the country, as a great deal of non-Francophone Canadians have commended the BQ's job at governing Canada. As well, many Francophone communities outside of Quebec have welcomed a new nationwide force representing them, as the Bloc has paid special attention to these areas in hopes to leverage their French-Canadian identity."

You saw what Reagan did? He took a big beautiful country and he wrecked it, he wrecked it quite frankly. And Bush! All he did was make things worse, he broke up America, he drove off businesses, he drove me away. And I think that's quite sad. Those people, those old Conservatives, they were no good. When I arrived in Canada, I said 'Hey look, these Reform Party people, they were just like Reagan!'. Reagan , who was a very incompetent person, who was the person who ruined the USA. And those Reform people were all very angry and didn't like Toronto, and I think that's not a very good brand for a party'.\n\n Furthermore, Trump would state that 'I loved the United States, it was a magnificent land of freedom and prosperity, but that's all gone now. When I ran for Prime Minister for Canada, I didn't want to make Canada America, because Canada was already America quite frankly, what I wanted to do was let Canada reach their full potential as a wonderful bastion of prosperity.

During the early 80's a concentrated effort to smear honest union organizations with slanderous links to organized crime and baseless claims about union dues took place, doing irreparable damage to the time-honored relationship between workers and their bosses. Hope for Canada's working men and women rebounded during Ed Broadbent's first term, as the CLC-aligned NDP was finally given a shot at power after decades of Conservative and Liberal Dominance. Even if the damage done by the Mulroney government was not fully undone, Broadbent's social-democratic government worked tirelessly to give Canada's unions a second shot. Throughout losses in the later 90's, the NDP remained the bulward of organized labour's representation in Canadian politics. However, that all changed during the tenure of Bob Rae. Rae, out of either greed or a desire to appease right-leaning members of the Canadian establishment so happily threw away countless years of solidarity between the NDP and the CLC, and in the process doomed his own Premiership. Now that Layton and union-friendly leadership has regained control of the party, the NDP is now once more the party of the working man. Even if certain unions haven't forgiven the party for the debacles under Rae's term, the majority of Canada's organized labour is firmly on our side once more."

The tenure of Ed Broadbent extended throughout the chaos following the collapse of the United States and later fall of NATO, and saw the NDP rise as Canada's most prominent left-wing force. While the Liberals would eventually regain their hold on the left-leaning establishment, Broadbent's victory permanently solidified the NDP as a serious player in the Canadian political arena. Even after leaving power, Ed Broadbent has always been a firebrand and staunch supporter of 'Classical' NDP politics. This stance, while popular to much of the party's base, made him many enemies during the tenure of Bob Rae, where he, along with Jack Layton, led a backbench revolt against the 'New NDP', forcing Rae to compromise with the Liberal party to remain in power. Lukiky, Rae's influence over the NDP would prove to be temporary, and loyalists to Jack Layton would take control of the party once more, solidifying the NDP's committal left-wing politics and organized labour.\n\n With this in mind, [CAN.GetLeader] has made a series of meetings and public appearances with Broadbent, securing the support of this veteran 'Dipper and making it clear that the legacy of Ed Broadbent's policies and image is rock solid."

Now, private companies will no longer be allowed to exploit Canadian citizens with a reckless focus on profit over essential service.

To achieve this, the Canadian Government has invested heavily in new cutting-edge gear, weaponry and military advisors for the new armies of Montana and Idaho. However this plan has fallen short in many areas, as much of the know-how on how to operate this equipment is known only to Canadian advisors, and not the Americans themselves. This unfortunate reliance on Canada has many worried that the armies of the Northwest may not be able to stand on their own two feet once the Canadians leave; others have dismissed these fears as hyperbole, and have promised continued support until such a time as the Northwest can achieve full military self-reliance.\n\n Regardless, there are still those in our General Staff who propose more significant investments in upkeep, and a broader focus on concrete strategy, something which would be more sustainable for rustic and isolated area. They also propose a greater focus on training for soldiers, as well as investments in more practical technology, rather than what's the most modern. "

This has led to much of our military establishment favoring a policy of 'collaboration' with the Militias, simply bribing them to stay out of our business and shifting the burden on to the local population. This has allowed a powerful underground to emerge in the Pacific Northwest, with former Neo-Nazi leaders turning to illegal means such as narcotics, moonshine and banned weaponry to fund their lifestyle. This market, while in close proximity to the Canadian border, has not spread to Canada due to a mutual understanding with ringleaders. This practical alliance between the Canadian government and the Northwest Black Market, while successfully managing to stem the flow of illegal goods into Canada, has also cost the Canadian government both untold funds and a significant amount of credibility with the restored governments of Montana and Idaho, who warn that this Black Market may become an uncontrollable force once the Canadian garrison departs."

While our policy on dealing with these stragglers is anything but consistent, our policy in advising the Montanan/Idahoan governments on the matter has remained rather consistent. This response focuses on a strong Central Government which can quickly effectively respond to threats, focusing on the utilization of command centers and urban infrastructure. This strategy, while not without its merits, has drawn criticism for neglecting the Northwest's rural terrain and reclusive population. Critics furthermore have argued that this policy as putting too much focus on the central government at the expense of local and county governments.\n\n The Canadian High Command however believes that shifting too much focus to local governments could potentially open the door to White Supremacist and Neo-Nazi infiltration.

Fears of a potential return to the Covington-era have been allayed, as the remaining Neo-Nazi militias scattered in the countryside have failed to gain any ground. The few powerful resistance cells left over by the Covington government have either collapsed due to infighting or have surrendered to the Montanan Army, and the final dedicated supporters of Richard Spencer's insane philosophy have either retreated in to the isolated woods to wither away, or have followed Spencer into his exile (and practical house-arrest) in the Soviet Union.\n\n While we can never know what the future will hold, it seems that the prospects for the new Republics of Montana and Idaho are bright."

Timothy McVeigh has been proclaimed the new Commander of the Montanan Nation, which has been reorganized on similar lines to the original Montanan Neo-Nazi Regime of Harold Covington. Meanwhile, in Idaho, Richard Spencer has returned from his exile in the Soviet Union with his diminished contingent of loyalists. Spencer, while managing to reassert control over his American Statelet, has had his position significantly weakened in comparison to the heydays of the Lincoln movement. The bulk of Spencer's support base defected after Spencer fled to the Soviet Union, taking with him many Fascist and Neo-Nazi members who detest Soviet influence.\n\n The Canadian Government has scrambled to evacuate collaborators and members of the former Democratic government, as well as many of the region's few remaining African-American and LGBTQ individuals."

The historic failure of the IntPhone marks the end of Apple's foray into smart telephone technology, with Steve Wozniak quietly announcing that the company intends to focus solely on Computing technology in the near future; much to the dismay of CEO Steve Jobs.\n\n Despite BlackBerry's rejection of this new 'smart telephone' design, CEO Mike Lazaridis has stated that BlackBerry will look into the implementation of touchscreen technology in the future; albeit as a secondary feature to the now iconic BlackBerry keyboard."

A rivalry born in blood and brews, Hockey night in Canada used to be the day where Canadians bite their nails and wonder if the Stanley Cup is coming home, or going to the States'. Of course, ever since the fall of the United States Canada has held a practical monopoly on the cup, with a Canadian team winning every cup since 1983, and an American team last coming to the final round in 2002. That has changed this year as the Arizona Coyotes have come to challenge the Ottawa Senators in 2010's Stanley Cup final. The Cyotes, who themselves defeated the Minnesota Wild, are the only hockey team in the Republic of Arizona, a nation which still continues participation in the NHL unlike the Commonwealth and the People's Republic.\n\n As the puck drops, countless Americans and Canadians hold their breath.

When the USA collapsed Blockbuster, along with most pre-collapse businesses, relocated the bulk of their management to Canada in hopes of stabilizing and eventually re-organizing their American locations. However this dream would never come to be, as the American Collapse was more akin to a miniature Civil War than an organized dissolution. This has resulted in many staples of pre-collapse American life living on in Canada, while their locations South of the Border are left to rot. Blockbuster is one such chain which has survived in Canada despite a less-than-ceremonious end in the United States, prevailing in the Canadian market much to the chagrin of Nostalgic Americans (who are known to sneak across the border to relive memories).\n\n While this popular movie rental chain has struggled in recent years due to the expansion of the Intranet, new developments have put Blockbuster on the forefront of a new and untapped market: Intranet Video Streaming. IntraFlix, a chain originally dedicated to the quick delivery of DVDs and VHS tapes through the mail, has quickly broken in to the Intranet Video market; soon becoming champions due to public dissatisfaction with Blockbuster's ubiquitous late fees. Even though an offer had been on the table for Blockbuster to purchase IntraFlix, the common perception in the company that the late-fees were more than enough to sustain themselves prevented them from finalizing the deal. Until recently. Blockbuster today has officially purchased IntraFlix, and thus has taken over the ground floor of Intranet Video Streaming. With Blockbuster now firmly in control of this valuable subset of the market, most analysts predict a bright future for both Blockbuster and the Video Streaming Industry; with many going so far as to predict that the iconic Blockbuster stores may be phased out in favour of an online-centric model."
