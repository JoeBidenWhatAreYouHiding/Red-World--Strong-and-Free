spain.1.t:0 "The King Rumored To Be In Poor Health"
spain.1.d:0 "King Juan Carlos I has faithfully ruled as the sovereign of Spain since the death of Caudillo Francisco Franco in 1975. Since then, he has guided his Kingdom through seemingly endless tumult, from the aggression of the Americans to the fall of Europe to communism to several years of terrorism and coup attempts against him and his regime. His Majesty’s life has been a stressful and turbulent one, and, at 72 years of age, this seems to have begun to manifest more physically. The King is seldom seen walking without a cane, and his form seems to have withered somewhat, with him looking almost frail to many observers. His speeches and public addresses have become more scarce over the last few years, only delivering them on major occasions, and often limiting these appearances to little more than a few minutes. The King’s heir apparent, Felipe, has also begun making more frequent appearances as of late, to mixed public reception. While few are brave enough to voice their concerns out loud, there is beginning to be a palpable sense of tension in the country, with the masses unsure of how much longer their king is fit to rule for. Thus far, the state has refused to issue any statement regarding the King’s health."
spain.1.a:0 "Surely he's fine"

spain.2.t:0 "King Juan Carlos I Suffers Heart Attack"
spain.2.d:0 "This morning, the state press announced to the public that King Juan Carlos I suffered a serious heart attack in his sleep. Thankfully, he is still alive, but state media reports that he is still in critical condition. Prince Felipe and Queen Sofía have reportedly refused to leave the King’s side, and other members of the royal family have been in and out of the hospital nonstop. Fear has gripped the nation, with the masses unsure of what future lies ahead. For decades, Juan Carlos I has been the face of Spain, a man with an indomitable strength, a willpower comparable to a force of nature, and an iron-clad sense of duty. The very notion of his mortality has stricken uncertainty into the hearts of a population that can scarcely recall a time without his confident guidance, and many have taken to the streets to express their support for the royal family during this trying time. However, the King was not loved by all. This tragic turn of fate seems to already have emboldened rabble-rousers throughout the country. Graffiti invoking anti-monarchist or even outright communist imagery has been spotted in cities throughout the country, and the police have received numerous tips from patriotic citizens reporting their neighbors for flying the flag of the Second Spanish Republic."
spain.2.a:0 "We pray for his swift recovery"

spain.3.t:0 "King Juan Carlos I Dies"
spain.3.d:0 "Despite the best efforts of the nation’s most skilled physicians, King Juan Carlos I died in his sleep last night, surrounded by family and friends. However, the nation had little time to mourn before an emergency coronation was called to crown Juan Carlos’ heir. Henceforth, the Kingdom of Spain shall be ruled by King Felipe VI. The televised ceremony was kept short and simple, given the circumstances, and a somber mood seemed to permeate the whole proceeding. In his address to the nation, Felipe referred to his acceptance of the crown as a “bittersweet” moment. “I am overjoyed and so unbelievably proud to lead the people of Spain,” the new King said during his tearful speech, “but it is with heavy heart that I wear the crown that once belonged to such an incredible man.” Juan Carlos I has long been a symbol of safety, stability, and tradition in Spain, and his passing has already rendered Spain a nation in mourning, with many citizens building memorials to him in their neighborhoods and homes. However, not everyone is mourning. Several protesters were arrested outside the royal palace during the coronation, calling for the end of the monarchy and for Felipe to finish the process of democratization that his father failed to carry out."
spain.3.a:0 "El rey esta muerto, larga vida al rey"

spain.4.t:0 "Felipe VI Reconvenes Cortes Españolas"
spain.4.d:0 "When Juan Carlos ended democratization in 1976, he suspended the Cortes Españolas, the parliamentary apparatus that had served as the country’s legislature since its implementation in 1942. While the Cortes has remained suspended ever since, it was never fully dissolved, and the Francoist constitution remains in effect. According to King Felipe, the time has come for this to change. He has reconvened the Cortes for the purpose of drafting a new constitution to “reshape Spain into a kingdom fit for the modern world.” This decision has proven immediately controversial. There are those in the country who feel that replacing the Francoist constitution is tantamount to treason, to spit in the faces of Franco and Juan Carlos, and rumor has it that many among the military sympathize with this sentiment. Additionally, while the Cortes have been reconvened, they have not been brought back in totality. Only the seats appointed by the head of state have been brought out of suspension, and while the democratically elected Cortes seats never had much power under Franco, many are still frustrated with this lack of representation for the common man. Already, law enforcement is struggling to keep a lid on protests and dissent, and the King has merely urged the populace to “trust the process.”"

spain.5.t:0 "Felipe Tours the Country"
spain.5.d:0 "With opposition to King Felipe’s rule seemingly rising by the minute, the new King has embarked on a tour of the country to meet with his subjects and help them to feel a connection to their new sovereign. On the tour, the King has been delivering uplifting speeches rife with jokes, taking photos with common people, personally speaking to community leaders, and even bestowing gifts at random to loyal citizens in the towns he visits. However, the reception hasn’t quite been what we had hoped for. Many find the King’s sense of “humor” to be grating or annoying, and others see his attempts to relate to his citizens as either disingenuous or unbecoming of a ruler. In either case, the result is a palpable air of both distrust and disrespect for the new King, and his efforts seem to have had little to no effect on the steadily growing dissident movement. While the tour is still planned to continue, it currently seems like it might be necessary to come up with a new approach, with many of Felipe’s advisors recommending that the focus of the King’s tour be shifted to relating to the youth of the nation, who are still impressionable. However, others believe that this change in program is not worth the cost and effort to plan, and that the King should simply continue his tour under the current program."
spain.5.a:0 "Aim new propaganda at the youth"
spain.5.b:0 "It's not worth the effort"

spain.6.t:0 "The Royalist Youth Forms"
spain.6.d:0 "“We are all the King’s children,” reads the slogan outside of the Francisco Franco Academy of Secondary Education’s newly formed clubhouse of the Royalist Youth. Recently, such clubhouses have cropped at schools and small communities all over the country following the King’s refocusing of his touring messages. While these Royalist Youth branches have the full support of the state, they have largely been established independently by student body and leadership programs at schools throughout Spain, who are increasingly coming to view the King in a positive light. In interviews hosted by the Royal Press Corpse, students gave varying responses as to why they feel such a connection to the King. One young girl from Madrid answered, “I love the King! He’s like a super nice dad to everyone!” while a teenage boy from Toledo answered, “the King is honestly really funny, I don’t really understand why my parents get so annoyed when he talks on the radio.” It’s often said that the youth is the future, and it’s clear that Felipe is quickly winning over their hearts and minds. Of course, only time will tell if he can manage to do the same with the nation’s adult population."
spain.6.a:0 "A new generation of young patriots"

spain.7.t:0 "Satirization Campaign"
spain.7.d:0 "With the King’s tour of the country coming to a close, it’s clear that the results have been nothing short of disaster. The protests against the King have only grown, and political cartoons, pamphlets, posters, and graffiti satirizing Felipe have begun to spring up all over the country. Several crates of this disgusting material have been seized by police, and the purveyors of such things have been fined for lesser treason. Still, the message sent by these satirical depictions of the King is clear; the people cannot take Felipe seriously. Despite the King’s best efforts to appear modern and relatable, public opinion has portrayed him as out of touch and spoiled, if not outright malevolent. “He’s a clown,” said one citizen of Madrid during interviews conducted by the Royal Press Corps, “He thinks that he’s one of us, but he’s never gone hungry, he’s never had to worry if he would make rent for the month.” Opinions such as these are seemingly very popular these days, and this campaign of satirization against the King appears to be the natural product of citizens using humor to express their frustrations with their government."
spain.7.a:0 "Whatever"

spain.8.t:0 "Protesters Gather Outside the Palace"
spain.8.d:0 "This morning, King Felipe and his family were awoken to the sounds of shouting outside of the royal palace in Madrid. In light of the steadily growing dissatisfaction with the current state of affairs in the nation, a veritable horde of protesters have arrived outside of the royal palace, many of them sporting the flag of the Second Spanish Republic. These protesters have been peaceful thus far, although their presence has been incredibly disruptive. With megaphones and chants, these protesters are calling for the democratization of the country, if not the restoration of the Spanish Republic. Obviously a return to Republicanism is unthinkable, but it’s clear that some sort of action must be taken in order to end the disruption and ensure the safety of the palace. Many of the King’s advisors have suggested that Felipe should address the crowd and reassure them that change is on the way, however, the military officers in the palace have a different idea. They believe that promising reform would be a sign of weakness, and that Felipe should instead show his strength and order the military to break up this crowd of treasonous actors. While the military won’t act with live munitions, the potential for civilian death or injury is high, and such a thing could serve to exacerbate the unrest gripping Spain."

spain.9.t:0 "Growing ETA Presence"
spain.9.d:0 "Over the last several days, troubling reports have begun to emerge from the Basque Country in Northern Spain. It would seem that the Basque nationalist and communist terrorist organization Euskadi ta Askatasuna, better known as ETA, has begun experiencing a period of growth amidst the recent turmoil. While the organization has not been as active for the last several years, the group has claimed responsibility for a plethora of high profile political assassinations over the decades, including those of Prime Minister Luis Carrero Blanco in 1973 and Prime Minister José María Aznar in 1995. Ever since ETA’s formation in 1959, they have done everything in their power to cripple the Spanish state so that they might secure an independent, communist Basque Country. Of course, they’ve always been thwarted, but it’s not been easy, and hundreds lie dead at their hands. Historically, ETA has been more than happy to collaborate with other anti-government political organizations, which could very well prove problematic for our government when considered alongside the rapidly expanding wave of protests against Felipe. While we don’t expect ETA to make any moves yet, additional Civil Guard units have been dispatched to the Basque Country to keep the peace."
spain.9.a:0 "We must watch this development closely"

spain.10.t:0 "The King Tours Barcelona"
spain.10.d:0 "Amidst his ongoing endeavors to establish a positive relationship with an increasingly adverse population, King Felipe held a rally in Barcelona this afternoon. Following a short speech, Felipe spent most of the event wading through the crowd connecting with the citizens. In his effort to relate to the people, Felipe attempted to speak Catalan for the entirety of the event. This choice has proven controversial. Within his first few sentences, the King’s lack of fluency in the language became abundantly clear, with him routinely either mispronouncing words or falling back on Spanish vocabulary to make up for the gaps in his understanding of Catalan. While no one expected the King to ever make an attempt to learn Catalan in the first place, this butchering of the language seems to have angered many Catalans, who take pride in their language and the culture associated with it. While some Catalans see Felipe’s attempts to connect with them as evidence that the new King will not be as harsh on Catalan nationalism as Juan Carlos or Franco were, it seems like the majority see him as just the latest in a long line of oppressors."
spain.10.a:0 "Spin the situation into something positive"
spain.10.b:0 "Let's just move on"

spain.11.t:0 "A Relatable Blunder"
spain.11.d:0 "In the wake of the public relations disaster of the King’s public appearance in Barcelona, the Royal Press Corps have been working overtime to salvage the King’s image. While getting into the good graces of the Catalans seems at this point to be a lost cause, public polls overall seem to be showing a marginally increasing degree of sympathy for the King. Appearing on several television and radio programs over the last several days, the King has made it abundantly clear that he’s extremely embarrassed by the event in Barcelona. Furthermore, he has made an effort to embrace the jokes circulating about him, deciding to laugh along rather than be laughed at, a move that seems to have helped to humanize him in the eyes of many. “But seriously now,” a Catalan interviewer asked the audience during a program with Felipe, “who among us hasn’t gotten the Catalan and Spanish languages mixed up? It’s hard! It’s confusing!” Many Catalans still despise Felipe, but this sentiment of relatability seems to have resonated with many who have learned Catalan as their second language. Overall, while King Felipe may still have only meager public approval, this small success has proven that he is not unsavable in the eyes of the public."
spain.11.a:0 "A successful spin"

spain.12.t:0 "An Out of Touch King"
spain.12.d:0 "The King's recent speech in Barcelona has not gone without issue, with recent reports from local police stations and Palauet Albéniz stating that the Catalonian population has taken great offence at the King's attempts to appeal to their heritage by pretending to be one of them. Such an act, which was not the intention of the King, who merely wished to demonstrate his capabilities in speaking Catalan and hopefully establish unity between the crown and the Catalonian population, has now sparked the onset of mass protests across Barcelona and other major Catalan cities. With flyers and portraits being burned, and chants of the “Patronizing Prince” echoing across the streets, the Catalan population are very vocal about their King’s half-hearted attempts to appeal to the people they believe he is oppressing. Elsewhere, outside of Catalonia, the rest of the nation has rejected these claims, realizing these protests to be a simple overreaction to the King’s poor Catalan. Despite this recognition outside of Catalonia, it is unlikely that the King will be able to recover the support he has lost from within the region as there are none more dedicated to the preservation of their heritage than the people of Catalonia."
spain.12.a:0 "They will come to love their rule eventually"

spain.13.t:0 "ETA Leads Riot in Bilbao"
spain.13.d:0 "In Bilbao, today members of ETA have dealt a devastating blow against the King and his loyal security forces. Just after midday, the group of communist Basque nationalists gathered across Bilbao demanding an end to the tyranny of the House of Bourbon-Anjou and the establishment of an independent Basque state. However, after the communists began to turn violent the police were quickly called to crack down on the situation which promptly turned into a riot. After a nearly two-hour battle, the riot ended in a stalemate with both sides steadily withdrawing, not before the rioters were able to loot and ransack stores across the city. The devastating report has led many within the military to call for an immediate response to the crimes committed by the secessionists in the hopes of reminding them of the hopelessness of their cause. Specifically, this response would see Spanish tanks line the streets of Bilbao with our soldiers overseeing the enactment of temporary martial law in the city. However, doing so risks significant consequences should the intervention fail, leading many to prefer that the King himself help pay for the damages caused, easing tensions and demonstrating that Felipe is a different man from his father."
spain.13.a:0 "Help pay for the damages"
spain.13.b:0 "Crush these terrorists"

spain.14.t:0 "ETA Growth Slows"
spain.14.d:0 "As a direct response to the King’s decision to pay for the vast majority of the damages caused by the recent ETA riot in Bilbao, many of its citizens have now come to see the truth behind the so-called liberators of the Basque, accepting that ETA is nothing more than terrorists seeking to undermine years of progress. Despite reports suggesting that ETA is still attracting members from all corners of the Basque Country, the recent goodwill of the King has ensured that these new recruits shall not come from Bilbao further solidifying himself as a legitimate reformer in the eyes of his people. However, whilst the people of Bilbao are grateful and as are many more within the government, the King has been unable to please everyone close to him. Whilst the military is pleased that the terrorists have been dealt a significant blow to their morale, Fulgencio Coll Bucher has made his opposition to this handout known. Bucher has claimed that whilst the King acted nobly, it was necessary for the army to intervene and demonstrate the futility of ETA’s rebellion rather than cowering behind an injection of cash to repair the damages. However, even with the military opposing this decision, the King is relieved with the outcome and is eager to find time to tour the city once reconstruction has been completed."
spain.14.a:0 "All according to plan"

spain.15.t:0 "Massive Increase in ETA Membership"
spain.15.d:0 "Much to the delight of the military, the King agreed to dispatch an armed battalion to the streets of Bilbao in the hopes of curtailing the rise in ETA presence and restoring order to the northern city. As tanks arrived at eight in the morning, followed by a further garrison of five-hundred soldiers, it was expected that martial law would keep people isolated in their homes allowing the army to dispatch and arrest only the most ardent supporters of ETA who would most likely take to the streets to protest the arrival of the army. However, unexpectedly, it appears that the presence of the army has instead driven more residents of Bilbao out onto the streets to protest against the government. Whilst these protests were short-lived, as warning shots were enough to drive the people back inside, the citizens of Bilbao have now become more concerned about the military itself than terrorists. With Bucher and his close allies celebrating the persecution of several leading ETA loyalists in the region, others are concerned that martial law will serve as a glorified recruitment drive for ETA. The military has dismissed these claims, however, stating that even if this is the case the new members will be rapidly hunted down and defeated with martial law being enough to starve out the underequipped rabble."
spain.15.a:0 "A little tough love is necessary at times"

spain.16.t:0 "Industrial Workers Strike in A Coruña"
spain.16.d:0 "The streets of A Coruña have today been lined with thousands of industrial workers in what has become the onset of a mass strike in Galicia. Whilst this strike would normally be permissible, the workers have now received the backing of known independence politicians such as Manuel Beiras and Anxo Quintana making the strike effectively a march both for worker's rights and Galician independence. If this were not justification alone to begin a crackdown on the movement the strikers themselves have reportedly been waving flags of the General Union of Workers as opposed to the only legal union- the Sindicato Vertical. The entire situation is a walking disaster for the King, who would be well within his right to order the police to initiate an immediate crackdown on the strike restoring order to the city. It is believed that, given the violations of several laws by the workers, the crackdown would be well received across the country demonstrating the King is tough yet fair when faced with a crisis. However, given that the King has no real say in manager-employee relationships, many in government have stated it would perhaps be best to allow the strike to continue and have the managers deal with their worker's demands, hopefully ending the strike before it has a chance to spread."
spain.16.a:0 "Let their bosses handle this"
spain.16.b:0 "This is illegal, order a crackdown"

spain.17.t:0 "Employers Grant Concessions to Strikers"
spain.17.d:0 "Rather than force through his own end to the strikes early on and risk the police action backfiring on his administration, the King has now been informed that concessions have now been granted to the workers striking in Galicia by their employers. With widespread reforms implemented into factories ensuring better worker safety, increased pay and better benefits for unforeseen time off work, the strike has now concluded with all of those in attendance now returning to work filled with pride knowing that industrial action can still bring about change in their nation. Whilst concerns were brought forward about the presence of Galician nationalists at the strikes, it has been agreed that this presence was mostly posturing with the vast majority of workers there solely to demand better conditions. However, even with the King and employers being satisfied with the outcome of the strike, the army refused to accept the situation as anything other than a blow to the legitimacy of their operations against secessionists. This peaceful end has now demonstrated that the socialists of Spain can make progress without resorting to terrorism, prompting the army to urge the King to intervene in future strikes should they appear and disregard the supposed pacification of the Galician working class."
spain.17.a:0 "Well, that worked out well"

spain.18.t:0 "Trade Unionism Grows in Galicia"
spain.18.d:0 "As soon as the police descended on the workers striking in A Coruña it became evident that the situation was beyond their control. Having expected limited resistance to their arrest of the most aggressive strikers, it came as a sudden surprise to many police when bottles were hurled in their direction and human barricades were formed to protect the most vulnerable. As the first day of strike action ended without issue, the second day began with the police recognizing their aggressive response to the strikers had prompted hundreds more to protest for worker’s rights and by extension Galician independence. With this bolstering of the protestors' ranks, the police have now been forced to take a step back from their attempts to arrest the strikers until reinforcements can arrive. Until this support arrives, it is expected that the streets will largely be controlled by the rapidly growing trade unionist movement. To make the situation worse, many of the workers turned towards the Galician nationalist movement following several speeches across the city by leading figures of the movement, who claimed that the only way for the working class of Galicia to be free is through its independence from Madrid."
spain.18.a:0 "But that's even more illegal!"

spain.19.t:0 "Protest in Zaragoza"
spain.19.d:0 "Republican protestors have now once again begun a campaign to rally the people to their side and pressure the government to remove the supposedly outdated and unneeded monarchy. Since their initial protests in Madrid, it appears that the republicans have been able to successfully convince more that the system is in need of both reform or a complete rework. Whilst most present in Zaragoza have been calling for the peaceful transition towards a constitutional monarchy where the King will act as nothing more than a figurehead who will remain neutral on all political affairs, the vocal minority of those calling for the end of the monarchy entirely has become a serious issue for the army and the King. The King has considered addressing those in attendance where he would harken back to his earlier speech in the year asking that those in attendance trust the process, hoping that his words will soothe their tempers until his reforms can be implemented. However, given the rapid pace at which the republicans have gained support, many within the army have instead demanded the King crack down hard and fast before their numbers multiply further."
spain.19.a:0 "Promise them reforms"
spain.19.b:0 "Forcibly disperse the crowds"

spain.20.t:0 "ETA Demands Basque Independence"
spain.20.d:0 "In a hijacked broadcast made throughout the Basque Country, ETA has now been emboldened by their recent successes across the region to be bold enough to demand immediate independence from Madrid. Following the initial broadcast, hundreds loyal to ETA have now taken to the streets of several cities from Vitoria-Gasteiz to Bilbao. The demands have, naturally, been written off as ridiculous with King Felipe refusing to bend his knee to these terrorists. However, this demand has raised the possibility of an effective way to end the dominance of ETA throughout the region. Whilst the King has rejected the possibility of independence, his advisors have suggested that local autonomy would be an effective way to stop ETA from using the supposed dominance of Madrid as justification for independence. However, the military, who have openly declared their opposition to this plan seeing it as the potential end of the Kingdom, have stated that appeasement with the communists is not an option. Similar to the earlier riots in Bilbao, the military has suggested that they must be sent in and enforce martial law across the entire region before separatists from across the country get similar ideas."
spain.20.a:0 "Compromise and give the Basques local autonomy"
spain.20.b:0 "This is ridiculous, send in the army"

spain.21.t:0 "King Felipe VI Authorizes Basque Autonomous Community"
spain.21.d:0 "In an effort to appease the people of the Basque Country, and curtail the continued rise in support for ETA, King Felipe VI has today announced his authorisation for the establishment of the Basque Autonomous Community. The establishment of the Autonomous Community will finally grant the Basque Country limited autonomy away from Madrid, with powers being granted to the region over several crucial policies ranging from the police force to infrastructure. Whilst the authorization of this devolution has already received widespread support from within the Basque Country, ETA has once again vowed to continue to fight against the supposed oppressors in Madrid claiming that these reforms are nothing more than a mere handout aimed at subverting their movement and the revolutionary cause of Basque independence. Despite ETA being right in their assumptions that this measure is merely an attempt to subvert their rapidly growing movement, the King is hoping that these reforms will be enough to end the violence in the region and, at last, bring the people around to his side. However, with the military warning that these demands will not go without a response from either Catalonia or Galicia, only time will tell whether the King has finally tamed the beast of the Basque."
spain.21.a:0 "Hopefully that puts this matter to bed"

spain.22.t:0 "ETA Gains Greater Membership"
spain.22.d:0 "As expected by the army, the installation of martial law across the Basque Country has not gone without issue. Despite heralding initial success through fear and mass arrests, the people of the Basque have now seemingly grown a spine and have defied the orders of the military taking to the streets to protest and riot against the continued occupation of their homes. In response to this, the army was granted the authority to, as per their right through the imposition of martial law, arrest those breaching the peace and if necessary execute those instigating violence. With over five hundred arrested, and nearly twenty killed, the situation across the Basque has reached a tipping point as the people of the region are now rapidly declaring their support for ETA. As martyrs are declared across the region, ETA issued a statement declaring that the occupation of their homeland must end immediately else further action will be taken. However, with the streets nearly flooded with protestors loyal to the terrorists, the military wonders what this further action will be and remain confident that their fear tactics will be enough to control the Basque Country entirely. Having now sent further garrisons to the region, it seems as if these claims are accurate and that ETA will not escalate tensions for some time."
spain.22.a:0 "We will put them in their place"

spain.23.t:0 "Catalan Separatists Rally in Barcelona"
spain.23.d:0 "As anticipated by the military, the Catalonians have now received word of the demands made by the Basque Country and have now begun to organize their own rallies in the hopes of pressuring a response from the King. The military has already pleaded to Felipe to allow immediate intervention at the Barcelona rally, hoping their presence will disperse the rally before it can gather traction and support from others across Catalonia. However, whilst intervention would see the immediate end of the rally, some are concerned that breaking up the rally would see a severe backlash from those in attendance and prompt thousands more to join the movement over the coming days. To make the situation worse reports have now arrived that the figurehead leader of the Catalan separatist movement, and known French asset, Carles Puigdemont is allegedly returning to lead the rally making a crack down all the riskier. As the military continues to remind the King, instability cannot spread across the nation, however, both options, in this case, will seemingly bring about instability either immediate or at some point in the immediate future."

spain.23.b:0 "Send in the military before it's too late"

spain.24.t:0 "Catalan Separatists Continue to Organize"
spain.24.d:0 "Much to the dismay of the military, who have continued to remind the King of the dangers of allowing the protests to continue, Felipe has refused to authorize any intervention into the Barcelona rally allowing the Catalan nationalists to continue to organize unopposed. However, despite the fear that this rally would turn violent the more time they were allowed to organize, the protests have been relatively peaceful with the initial protestors who were burning effigies of the King being either asked to leave or agreeing to calm their methods. This relative peace has, for now, placated the military who were insistent that the King intervenes through force. Despite this temporary placation of their demands, the military still remains alert fearing that they will inevitably be called up to crack down on the protests should the rumors be true that the figurehead of the movement, Carles Puigdemont, is truly returning to Spain. For now, all the King and his allies can do is wait and hope that allowing the Catalans to gain their strength was the right move to prevent the outbreak of further violence."
spain.24.a:0 "This movement will die out in time"

spain.25.t:0 "Widespread Riots in Catalonia"
spain.25.d:0 "The military has been successful in its attempts to dissolve the ongoing separatist protests in Barcelona. However, whilst the protests have been put to an end, riots have now begun to pop up across Catalonia in response to the King's decision to authorize military intervention. Naturally, the hardest hit area has been Barcelona itself with approximately seven hundred citizens rioting in the hopes of reclaiming the streets from the military. Similar scenes have been witnessed in Girona and Tarragona with the police having to request backup as the separatists were able to briefly hold control of streets and buildings in the cities. The situation, which has been promised to be brought under control by the military, has now escalated beyond what the King had been prepared for, fearing that his actions will now attract more to the side of the Catalans. Despite the riots spreading, and the people of Catalonia now more united against Madrid than ever, there has been little word regarding the figurehead of the Catalan movement prompting the intelligence services to begin an immediate search into where Carles Puigdemont is at the moment. For if he is to return now that Catalonia is gripped by a united front, it may spark the beginning of the end for the Kingdom just as the military predicted."
spain.25.a:0 "We must get this situation under control"

spain.26.t:0 "Galicia Demands Greater Freedoms"
spain.26.d:0 "Ever since the beginning of the A Coruña strike it has been clear to many within the government and the military that the situation in Galicia has now begun to escalate. Reports that the Galician Nationalist Bloc under Xose Manuel Beiras have been able to garner widespread support from the populace of the region following the recent protests in the Basque and Catalonia have now reached Madrid. With this newfound support, the Galicians have now taken to the streets to demand greater independence as well as the recognition of Galician as a nationality separate from and equal to Spanish! To make the situation worse, the Galicians have threatened to secede should their demands not be met. Again the military demanded that the King intervene through the imposition of martial law, maintaining the status quo in the region. However, with the workers of Galicia rallied to the side of the nationalists the solution may not be as simple. Just over fifty per cent of Galicia is employed, and with the industrial strike rallying more to their side, this would potentially bring over a million men and women to the streets should the military fail. Therefore, the King has been advised that it may be best to accede to their demands rather than risk the possibility of all-out conflict with over a million workers."

spain.27.t:0 "King Felipe VI Authorizes Galician Autonomous Community"
spain.27.d:0 "King Felipe, hoping to avoid the potential for Galician secession, has now given in to the demands of the Galician Nationalist Bloc and has now authorized the establishment of the Galician Autonomous Community. Whilst this Autonomous Community is not precisely what the Galician nationalists were demanding, with their leaders seeking independence or something resembling it, the King feels as if this generous concession will be enough to pacify the movement for the time being. Surprisingly, reports have detailed that this assumption by the King is somewhat accurate with the protestor’s numbers declining following the announcement with only the most vehement nationalists remaining. As a result of this, the movement has largely quietened for the time being as the people of Galicia now turn to thank the King for recognizing their region as needing reform. With a legislative assembly now being handed powers over transportation to infrastructure, it is expected that the Autonomous Community will, at last, bring a degree of stability needed in the fragile region and abate the supposed collapse of the Kingdom fantasized about by the military."
spain.27.a:0 "We'll rope them back in eventually"

spain.28.t:0 "Galician Nationalists Gain Support"

As expected, the workers of Galicia have now rallied to the streets with reports detailing that if the situation is not contained soon Galicia may be able to mobilize its, around, two-hundred thousand industrial workers to oppose the King and the military. With the main battles taking place in major cities the nationalists have seen victory as street after street falls under their control. Thankfully, the military has been able to halt this advance using tear gas and lethal force when required. However, it is not clear for how long this situation will be able to be maintained with some generals in the region claiming that reinforcements will be required over the coming days. Advisors have already requested that the King agree to send more soldiers to the region, but with the Catalans now beginning to step up their rallies in Barcelona such requests have been denied for the time being. If the situation is not handled soon then the long-awaited collapse may soon begin, with Galicia being the catalyst."

Across Catalonia, protests have gripped both major cities and small towns with all in attendance chanting for the liberation of the Catalan people demanding the establishment of an independent nation from Spain. Whilst this demand is of course ridiculous with the King once again dismissing the separatists’ calls, he has once again been presented with the opportunity to placate the Catalan masses through the establishment of local autonomy via the creation of a Catalan Autonomous Community. Whilst this may be the easiest method to secure peace in the region, the military has expressed great displeasure with the idea more than they had done with the Basque and Galician proposals. Given that a Catalan Autonomous Community would tear significant land away from the authority of Madrid, their opposition is understood. Once more, the military has requested an immediate imposition of martial law and the authority to crack down on all protests in the region. However, doing so would no doubt have severe consequences."

With the head of the armed forces, Fulgencio Coll Bucher, having declared this to be a step too far the King and the military now rest on uneasy terms with the loyalty of several elements of the armed forces now being brought into question. However, even with this distrust, the King remains convinced that the army will calm themselves down once the benefits of the Autonomous Community are revealed and the people of Catalonia once again fall in line under the grip of Madrid. Whilst the community was not the desired outcome by many Catalan nationalists, the legislative sovereignty now enjoyed by the region should be enough to temporarily end all discussions of independence and allow for a new status quo to establish itself in the region. As the more radical elements of the protests now begin to tone down, and the moderates start returning to their homes, it appears that the King has won a great victory over the separatists. However, unless the benefits are witnessed soon the military may grow more and more disloyal."

Whilst the intelligence agency itself has been unable to locate precisely where Puigdemont is in Barcelona, his return regardless has worried many including the King himself. Puigdemont commands great respect and authority within the Catalan independence movement and his return to Spain can only mean that he believes that the people of Catalonia are now prepared to take drastic action to secure their independence, including open warfare with the Spanish armed forces. The most damning rumor that has been spread throughout our intelligence agency is, which only adds to the belief that the immediate declaration of independence is a certainty, that Puigdemont has now begun to establish a provisional government. If this rumor is to be believed, then it is vital that the armed forces be prepared for an immediate struggle against the Catalan separatists. Fulgencio Coll Bucher has already dispatched several battalions to the region, awaiting the King’s command to engage and the secession of Catalonia."

Having secured the palace, and disarmed the soldiers guarding the King, the flag of the Second Spanish Republic was soon hoisted above the palace signifying the end of an era for the Spanish monarchy and the rebirth of a people’s Spain. Soon after the King was placed under house arrest, acting Prime Minister Pablo Iglesias declared to the crowds gathered outside that a new era had finally dawned for the nation, stating that 1939 had at last been avenged with the people now once again in command. However, with turmoil still rife across the country, Iglesias must act quickly if the revolution is to be successful else his promise that 1939 had been avenged may be premature.

Whilst tensions have indeed died down with the Kingdom, at last, looking forward to continued prosperity this new era has not been welcomed by all across the country. In a last-ditch attempt to bring the country to its knees, and damage the newfound support the King enjoys, the far-left has now called upon its supporters to engage in a general strike hoping that through their strike the monarchy will be toppled. Already the strike is enjoying some success, with several industrial workplaces already voting to join the strike, but it is hoped that this final attempt to overthrow the King will soon be ended as economic reforms are enacted to fix the longstanding issues created by years of isolation."

Having become infuriated at the King’s lack of strength and cowardice in the face of the separatists threatening the stability of the Kingdom, there was little choice left in the eyes of the military but to depose their King for being unwilling to follow the rules and expectations of the Francoist constitution. Felipe’s constant disregard for the need for a strong central authority, and desire to change the constitution to appease various communist and socialist groups, has now been purged from all corners of government with the King being placed under house arrest to prevent his interference in politics. However, this coup has not sat well with the public with several leading members of the Sindicato Vertical calling for a general strike, with countless more illegal trade unions doing the same. This communist agitation now threatens the stability of the nation, with General Bucher himself worried that unless the economic situation is resolved quickly the nation may either fall back into the hands of King Felipe or into the darkness under the communist rabble."

Having witnessed the King abuse his position and side with the military on several occasions to crush dissent, the nation has now splintered into two distinct factions- those who support the continuation of the Francoist constitution and those who wish to see a new era dawn over Spain. Having worked quickly to capture vital military installations across the nation, and secure the loyalty of the soldiers posted there, the Spanish Provisional Republic led by Pablo Iglesias demanded that General Bucher stand down and let the people lead the nation forward. However, following a shootout at a military installation just outside of Madrid, there can now be no peaceful exchange of power. After eighty years of relative peace, the nation has now fractured once more and the future of the country again rests in a battle between Republicans and Francoists."

As anticipated by intelligence services, Carles Puigdemont has now established a provisional government during his brief time in Barcelona and is no doubt already working to secure the backing of his French and EU allies. Therefore, the King has decreed that the military is to intervene immediately in the hopes of crushing this rebellion before either French or EU aid arrives to bolster the weakened Catalan forces. For the time being the military is hopeful that the Catalan nationalists have not been able to secure large depots of arms and ammunition allowing them to easily combat the secessionists. Holding a clear numerical advantage it is expected that the operation in Catalonia should not take much longer than a few weeks. However, some are worried about the potential for sabotage by the Catalan populace against the Spanish military with plans already in the works to combat guerilla warfare.

Beginning in the early hours of the morning, ETA announced that it could no longer sit by as the people of the Basque were subjugated by an oppressive tyrant in Madrid officially declaring their independence shortly after. This declaration has not been without surprise and the military has already dispatched several to the Basque in the hopes of containing the situation before ETA begins to march its forces outside of the cities. Several police units in the region have already been able to establish control of minor towns, however, it is unlikely that they will be able to secure these towns for long as ETA has reportedly been able to seize control of several police stations that will grant them the necessary equipment to push back our forces. With both Catalonia and the Basque now aflame, it is only a matter of time before either the military is successful in its pushes against the secessionists or their guerilla tactics prove too much for our military.

Unlike the sudden and rapid takeover of Catalonia, the Galician nationalist have been much more methodical in their approach to secession, carefully gaining the support of its working class and dwindling down the support for the crown over several months. Reports have indicated, therefore, that because of this slow and methodical approach to secession the Galicians are not as well prepared for a long conflict with many still reluctant to engage the government through guerilla warfare. The army has hoped that this means that any operations against the Galicians will be swift and decisive. However, despite these reports, the King has urged the military to not underestimate the support for the Galician Nationalist Bloc and Manuel Beiras, fearing that the slightest error or escalation may bolster their support and bring the level of dedication to independence to the same par as Catalonia. Regardless, the military is convinced that the war against Galicia shall be quick even if the momentum has now swung towards the side of the rebels."

The peace deal, should the King agree to its terms, would see an immediate ceasefire established across all fronts with Madrid pledging to recognize the independence of the regions that have risen up against the King and his government. However, as expected by many close to the King, the military has outright rejected these calls for peace, claiming that the devastation to the military and the regions affected by guerilla warfare cannot be simply forgotten, demanding an immediate escalation of the war allowing them to achieve a decisive breakthrough against the separatist forces. Promising the war can be won through the continued shelling of both military and civilian targets, General Bucher pleaded with the King to not sign away half of his Kingdom to the communists.

Whilst the war is unpopular, with many across the nation being affected by the constant fighting, Felipe is heavily reluctant to agree to these demands believing that the secessionists are overstepping their mark by demanding the return of these lands to the Catalan people. The military has also agreed with the King, promising that the rebels are now facing severe supply issues and that the military will soon be able to recover the lands lost to the secessionists.

However, whilst the King has now enjoyed a small surge in support from across the Kingdom for his valiant efforts in defeating the secessionists, there are many more who have grown to oppose the King for his foolish attempts to use autocratic measures to ensure the end of the separatists. As a result, several illegal trade unions have now called for the beginning of a general strike to hopefully bring about an end to the King’s dictatorship. Already this has been extremely successful as factories undamaged by the civil war now lay empty, crippling any chances of a return to a pre-civil war society.

Viewing the King as a coward who refused to allow the military to take necessary action against the separatists to secure victory over them, the army has now placed the King under house arrest stripping him of his rank ensuring he can never again interfere in politics. Whilst the coup has been widely celebrated by many within the military, there are few outside of it who have accepted the situation with the people turning against the government hoping to bring it down. This disobedience has largely been concentrated through the onset of a general strike across the nation which seeks to apply pressure on the government to resign and allow for the establishment of democracy.

As a result, the new military administration has revealed itself to be no better than King Felipe with the people now rising up across much of the country’s south under the banner of the Spanish Provisional Republic. The acting Prime Minister of the Republic, Pablo Iglesias, has now vowed to destroy the legacy of Francoism entirely from Spain pledging that this final conflict will see a return to the democratic values of the Second Republic, where all can, at last, be free of the shackles of tyranny. However, despite these valiant claims, the military is confident that these rebels can easily be defeated as they have severely overestimated the amount of support they hold.

Ordering the beginning of further conscription, the King has been bolstered by this recent secession declaring that the Kingdom will triumph over its enemies and stand against the communist rabble seeking to undo years of progress.

With the monarchy having only begun to falter following the coronation of Felipe VI this year, there is now a growing movement within the military to maintain the role of the monarchy merely under a different house. Felipe’s continued intervention into politics and desire for unrestrained reform has demonstrated well that the House of Bourbon-Anjou can no longer be trusted to lead the nation, however, the same cannot be said for the Carlists. The Carlist line has the power to regain the people’s trust, allowing the military to easily justify their removal of Felipe. However, whilst there are countless moving to support the claimant of the Carlists, others are less convinced, concerned that their coronation would see the continued unraveling of the Francoist constitution and the imposition of a new, unstable, state."

Whilst initially dismissive of the proposition, proclaiming it to be nothing more than an attempt to usurp him from power and allow for the undermining of the Francoist constitution, the General has now recognized the potential international benefit of this plan. If General Bucher were to step down and allow for the election of a civilian dictator it is more likely that the government will gain the backing of the international community, potentially allowing for the gradual undoing of decades of isolation. Antonio Perez Bencomo, the leader of the Falangist movement, has already been pinpointed as the ideal replacement and has already agreed to preserve the constitution as best as he can.

Javier’s father, Carlos Hugo, adhered to the principles of a socialist absolute monarchy and because of this his main rival, Sixtus Henry of Bourbon-Parma, believes that because he refuses to denounce his father he should be disqualified and the title granted to him. Sixtus, having styled himself as Enrique V, has demanded the claimant be handed to him in order to ward off a legitimized socialist movement. Whilst Enrique’s words are true, there are many who would first wish to extend a hand out to Carlos hoping to gain insight into his own opinions on the matter and to see if he would be willing to renounce his father and his socialist tendencies.

Whilst the PSOE have long fought for the establishment of liberal democracy, the United Left instead sees this as an insidious attempt to legitimize reactionaries and grant them a voice in government. With this debate raging, Albert Rivera and his Popular Union have attempted to have their voices heard demanding that the constitution refute the values of socialism demanding that the Prime Minister find a suitable compromise. Despite this, Prime Minister Iglesias is failing to do so with some within his party decrying his lack of action and authority.

Despite the PSOE and PU’s unity around this matter, the United Left has refused to grant their support to the idea believing it to be a ludicrous solution to an already solved matter. Believing that they already hold a mandate from the people, the United Left has demanded that the PSOE and PU step aside, using their efforts in organizing strike action during the revolution as their justification. Decried by their opponents for this belief, the United Left has continued to state it is the true party of the Spanish Republic refuting claims that a general election would prove otherwise. This standstill has worried many members of parliament who believe that the longer the debate goes on, the more time the far right is given to justify their opposition to the republic allowing for them to easily depose the government and reestablish the dictatorship."

With this walkout, any sense of unity has now completely unraveled. In an effort to salvage the reputation of the government, several members of the PSOE and Popular Unity have called for the Prime Minister to authorize a general election to hopefully shatter the legitimacy of the United Left.

However, whilst many had anticipated individual parties to stand for their own benefit, the current government has instead elected to stand united with the leader of the so-called Left Coalition being determined via a vote after the election is over. Likewise, hoping to mirror this unity and attract as many votes as possible, the conservatives of our nation have done the same establishing the aptly named Right Coalition. Such a strange election has confused many, with some instead protesting that the parties should stand individually for an accurate reflection of the Spanish people’s will, yet with the nation divided a vast majority have accepted this as necessary.

With acting Chairman Alberto Garzón having long fought to keep his party’s namesake a reality, division has only continued to creep into the halls of government following its sudden emergence to power. With Syndicalists, NeoCommunists and Leninists all vying for power and influence over the future of the new republic, the government has now authorized the beginning of debates starting with how best to achieve socialism. The Syndicalist factions have presented their argument that the only way for socialism to be successful and legitimate is through it being led by the very people who serve the state, the Labor Unions. However, whilst sentimental to the needs of the unions, both the NeoCommunists and Leninists have instead argued that only a vanguard party filled with the intellectuals needed to carry out the revolution properly can secure socialism and make the people aware of their purpose in the new state. After back and forth discussion, the committee finally reached a verdict and ended the first round of debates. "

Whilst under the provisional republic, it had been largely agreed that the King would be allowed to stay in the country our government has promised to not be so lenient to the scourge of our nation. Both Leninists and Syndicalists have agreed that in order for the revolution to be successful, and justice to be enacted for the crimes of their family, the King must be executed to send a message to any reactionary elements that a similar fate awaits them if they persist to organize against the government. However, whilst the King's execution would demonstrate the power of our government effectively, the various NeoCommunists have argued it may be a step too far. Suggesting that the King's execution would only motivate the remaining reactionaries as Felipe would have become a martyr in their eyes, the NeoCommunists have instead suggested that he and his family be exiled from the country demonstrating the new government as one of consciousness and not as radical as believed. Yet, many believe this plan would simply allow the King a chance to regroup abroad and organize a countercoup with the backing of the international capitalist class."

spain.57.d:0 "The final topic of debate has now been presented to the government, with the various factions now more united than ever given the subject up for discussion. Having settled how the revolution is to be carried out and the fate of the King the committee has now sought the answer to how the leader of the new republic is to be decided. The Leninists have all agreed that the only true way for the leader of the nation to be appointed is from the wills and wishes of the Communist Party of Spain further enshrining the role of the vanguard as the one to lead the masses into the first stages of communism. However, both the Syndicalists and NeoCommunists have been fiercely opposed to this proposal seeing it as a decent towards the decadent practices of much of the Warsaw Pact. Instead, these two factions have united around a more democratic proposal with any leader being granted a mandate from the proletariat. Whilst this proposal has been well received outside of the committee, with several trade unions demonstrating their support, the Leninists have argued that the people's minds are easily corrupted and that only the Communist Party has the strength to elect an effective leader that will put the advancement of communism first."

spain.58.t:0 "Committee Debates Conclude"
spain.58.d1:0 "With the debates concluded the committee has today been able to, at last, be dominated by a singular faction, and to the surprise of few the Leninist wing of the Communist Party has now successfully been able to force the committee to recognize them as the sole leaders of Spain. In a grand ceremony, Enrique Santiago was duly elected to the position of General Secretary of the Communist Party where he gave his first speech to the new Spain. Promising to serve the nation solely for the advancement of communism, the President has pledged that a new form of humanistic Marxist-Leninism will sweep across the country reshaping every corner of society. Whilst all within the Leninist faction have cheered this development, pledging their undying loyalty to Santiago, the Syndicalist and NeoCommunists have only offered their tepid congratulations knowing full well that their movements will now be either sidelined or absorbed into the Communist Party allowing the vanguard party to act unopposed. With the nation celebrating the end of division and the establishment of a functioning government, President Santiago now begins work to reshape the nation, hoping to replicate the successes of the Warsaw Pact."
spain.58.d2:0 "With the committee having now drawn a close to the recent debates, it has become evident to all that the NeoCommunists within the Communist Party have now been successful in achieving dominance over the government allowing its leadership to rule unopposed. With the Communist Party having largely celebrated this development, with only its hardliners opposing the development, the Syndicalists have pledged to back the new government on certain matters but have stopped short of congratulating General Secretary José Luis Centella fully. In his first address to the nation, the President promised to stay true to his ideals and pledges made throughout the committee debates believing that he can begin a democratic transition towards true communist rule in the coming years. Having drafted a plan for the first three years of his governance, the President hopes to learn from where France had failed to allow him to undo the wrongs of previous governments whilst avoiding a Spanish Night of Ink. With much work to be done in such a short period of time, the nation now waits with bated breath to see just how successful the new President will be."
spain.58.d3:0 "To the surprise of all present during the end of the recent debates, the committee has now become dominated by the Syndicalist wing of the United Left. Having jubilantly celebrated their victory over their opponents in the Communist Party, José María Álvarez Suárez has now been appointed as the new leader of the Spanish Republic. The General Secretary of the General Union of Labor has now pledged to begin the mass reformation of the state, enshrining Syndicalist doctrine through the empowerment of the workers and advancement of the union movements allowing them more control over their own workplace. Whilst the nation has celebrated this victory, many within the Communist Party have been wary of the Syndicalist victory believing that Álvarez’s reforms are a step too far away from what was envisioned by Marx and Lenin. Dismissing this opposition, the President has pledged a golden era of prosperity for the working people of Spain believing that in time these very same communists will soon be united behind his government as the reforms prove successful. However, with many refusing to support the President, Álvarez will have to press on without the communist's support seeking to establish the GUL as the sole party of the left."
spain.58.d4:0 "Many had assumed at the start of the debates that by their end a dominant faction would have emerged victorious allowing them to oversee the future of the republic. However, it has now become apparent this is not the case, with neither of the three factions being successful in their attempts to achieve dominance, leaving a power vacuum in the halls of government. With every member of the government continuing the debates, arguing over either theory or semantics, the people have now grown fearful that this bickering will do little more than strengthen the resolve of the reactionaries within the armed forces, allowing them to recuperate and overthrow the revolution. Having joined in with these fears, the government has now attempted to once more find a solution hoping to elect a compromise candidate. Yet, given the divisions already present, finding a candidate that can appease all three factions will prove difficult. With a first round of voting already ending in failure, and joint rule being rejected by the Leninist faction, a leader must be found soon with all knowing that this leader must command the respect of the party and be prepared to offer serious concessions if the government is to survive."

spain.59.d1:0 "Despite the Republican Coalition having been successfully able to ratify a new constitution, installing new rights for the people of Spain where they previously had none, the lack of trust and unity amongst the coalition has ultimately spelt its doom forcing the government to call a snap election. Unlike before, the various parties have now splintered off allowing the people of Spain to voice their true opinions. With the PSOE and its various factions splintering into the United Labor Party and the Spanish Socialist Workers Party, the opportunity for the Popular Union to achieve a landslide victory has now become a possibility as division amongst the left continues to tear it apart. However, such an outcome is not entirely likely as National Democracy has continued to emerge from the woodwork and now polled at steady levels, prompting communist activists to brag about being proven right about the restoration of democracy. With all four parties near neck and neck many have been unable to predict the outcome of the elections, and now the fate of the republic lies entirely upon who has been able to resonate well with the public and if they have been able to attract enough of their supporters to the ballot."
spain.59.d2:0 "With parliament having now been dissolved after lengthy discussions between the King and Prime Minister, the snap election has finally arrived with the nation hopeful that whoever wins is able to end chaos in the streets. With the People’s Party and One Spain now free to discredit their former coalition partners, initial debates have been anything but productive as most representatives of the two main parties have done more to divide the nation than unite it. Despite this division though, the debates have been able to successfully demonstrate the clear divide between the former members of the Right Coalition. Unfortunately for the Right Coalition, National Democracy has continued to rise in the polls continuing to build its radical base via demonstrations and street battles across the nation. With Seranno being denounced as a fascist by many, the Socialist Workers’ Party has hoped to gain the favor of the grand coalition of voices dissatisfied with the right and those who reject Seranno’s messaging. The success of the coalition, however, has remained entirely dependent on the campaigning effectiveness of the Workers’ Party which has already put off many moderates due to their recent actions across the nation in battling against Seranno and allegedly instigating riots during the recent protests"

While recent reforms enacted by the government have undeniably improved Spain’s economic standing, they have not been without criticism or controversy. In particular, the recent package of legislation regarding the privatization of the Spanish military industry has drawn many to examine the connections between One Spain officials and the private companies that are benefiting from this policy. In light of these potential conflicts of interest in the government, the opposition parties have at last built up enough influence to propose an investigation into the issue. However, their support is not absolute, and it may be possible to make some deals with the opposition parties in order to break the support for this investigation, although such an action would require extensive political capital and risks making the government look even more corrupt. Of course, we could always just allow the investigation to continue as planned, although doing that could easily result in our government’s fall. Finally, in a drastic move, the Prime Minister could take the fall for the party, admitting to wrongdoing and a conflict of interests and resign from office."

A few short days ago, it seemed that the opposition parties in the Cortes had more than enough support to move forward with such an investigation, given the many signs of corruption and conflicts of interest within the current government, however, several members of the Cortes have changed directions seemingly overnight. Many people see this as proof of the government's corrupt nature, and it is no secret that Rajoy and his cabinet have expended considerable effort attempting to dissuade various members of the Cortes from supporting the investigation. However, without the investigation, there is no proof that anyone in the government has done anything illegal or that any of the government’s policies constitute a conflict of interest. Of course, there are still many who hold onto the belief that Rajoy’s government is fundamentally corrupt and worthy of a motion of no confidence, however, these figures are unlikely to gather the support they need in the near future."

Furthermore, Rajoy has relinquished his role as Prime Minister. This is the second time he has resigned from this position, having resigned in 2008 after a public dispute with King Juan Carlos I, who had appointed Rajoy to the position of Prime Minister in 2004 when he was still a member of the People’s Party. While many saw his 2008 resignation as a powerful political demonstration against the crown’s autocratic tendencies, this resignation has already done damage to Rajoy’s career that will likely prove irreparable. Following Rajoy’s resignation, his trusted right hand, Soraya Sáenz de Santamaría, will take his place. She is under scrutiny as a close friend of Rajoy’s but many are ecstatic to see a woman ascend to the premiership for the first time in Spain’s history."

Dozens of One Spain members of parliament have been discovered to have ties to the very companies that stood the most to gain from the selling off of defense contracts. Prime Minister Rajoy himself seems to have benefited fairly little from the bill when compared to his colleagues, who have already made millions of pesetas off of their ties to various defense contractors. However, despite Rajoy standing little to personally gain from the bill, many of its most blatantly corrupt articles were penned by his hand. This has predictably caused a crisis of faith in the current administration. Rajoy has maintained that he only did what was best for the recovery of the Spanish economy and the creation of capital in the country. Despite Rajoy’s attempts to defend the bill, members of parliament from all represented parties, including those members of One Spain not implicated in the scandal, have condemned his actions, and it seems that a motion of no confidence is on the horizon."

spain.66.d:0 "As expected, parliament brought a motion of no confidence against Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy to the floor today. By an overwhelming and cross partisan vote, the decision was made to dismiss Rajoy from the premiership. Even members of One Spain who were implicated in the recent scandal voted in favor of dismissing Rajoy, although most voters have seen this as a desperate attempt to retain a semblance of respectability and legitimacy, and most of those who made money off of Rajoy’s corrupt legislation chose to abstain from the vote. With Rajoy removed from office and exiled from the party, One Spain has chosen Soraya Sáenz de Santamaría to take his place. While she’s a controversial pick for being a friend of Rajoy’s, her record has remained clean and she was the next highest ranking One Spain official. With the consent of the King, all those implicated in the scandal have been dismissed from both the government and One Spain. There are vocal calls for Santamaría to announce snap elections in the wake of this scandal, but she has chosen to attempt to govern Spain with her disgraced party until the next election cycle in hopes of restoring the public’s faith in One Spain."

To facilitate a return to pre-1987 levels, and hopefully beyond, President [Root.Getleader] has announced their intention to transition the economy to match the success of the communist states of Europe. However, given the need to overturn and effectively rebuild the economy from the ground up, the President has detailed that this plan shall occur over the course of the next few years once again pledging to avoid the devastating effects of France’s Night of Ink. With economists fully backing the plan, and the people recognizing the necessity of restraint, it is anticipated that the economy shall soon enter a boom as the vestiges of Francoist autarky are expunged from the people’s lives. However, hardliners have continued to denounce the plan believing that the continued use of the Francoist system places the revolution at great risk and that the President should abandon their plans for steady reform. Stating that the economic reform will largely phase out the Francoist system within the first year, these hardliners have now largely been silenced as public opinion has continued to side with the President."

Provided that the nation remains stable, and the international situation remains peaceful, economists have predicted that by at least 2020 the Spanish economy will be able to compete with the most advanced communist states in Europe. With this tremendous success, even the hardliners have congratulated the President on their successes, however, many still hold the belief that the economy could have been resolved long ago through immediate reform to the system rather than pussyfooting around the matter. Recognizing that they shall never see eye to eye, the President has instead turned his attention to the people thanking them for their patience throughout the last few years and eagerly awaiting for all to bask in the economic benefits of the modern era.

Believing that the people of Spain would see through this obvious attempt of forcing an undemocratic constitution onto the nation, it was not long after the session had ended that Prime Minister Iglesias recognized the severity of the call for a general strike. Initial reports have indicated that several sectors of the economy, most notably public services, have begun strike action against the government with many more unions beginning discussions around whether to join the strike. As the United Left continues its calls for action outside of parliament, our once somewhat stable nation has now descended again into the arms of chaos. Hoping to calm tensions, the Prime Minister has refuted the claims that the United Left has been ignored during constitutional debates stating that all manner of voices have been heard throughout the process, however, many workers are choosing to ignore him hoping that industrial action the government shall step aside ushering in a truly revolutionary republic."

Strapped to a post near the Mediterranean, Felipe remained surprisingly calm throughout his final moments with his only words being another farewell to his wife and children. As the blindfold was tied around his head and the firing squad raised their rifles, Felipe thought briefly about how he had arrived in this situation, how he had tried to better his nation and overcome the sins of his father. Recognizing he had failed his nation, the former tyrant's thoughts were suddenly silenced as his executioners fired their weapons. In one precise shot, the tyranny of the feudal lord was over as the bullet pierced deep into his brain killing him instantly. Now, with the public being made aware of his death and Felipe being buried in an unmarked grave, the President [Root.Getleader] has given a celebratory speech claiming that the rebirth of the nation was marked by the death of Felipe and that his death should be a warning to all reactionaries seeking to overthrow or undermine the people’s government."

Having expected the new government to grant his family exile and place the brunt of the blame for the sins of his government onto him, Felipe’s delusions were quickly shattered as state police entered his house and shot his family until their magazines had run dry. With the gallows prepared, and Comrade Frutos having already signed the execution papers, the former King was given no time to prepare himself for his death as the tyrant was quickly hung and left to swing until all life had left his wretched body. As he swung and twitched, the party loyalists gathered to watch the event continued to stone his body cheering as the main line of feudal beasts were at last hunted to extinction.

Today, with the signing of Spain’s new constitution, this comes to an end. Spain, now officially called the Federal People’s Republic of Spain, has become an explicitly communist state operating on a federal political structure. The Communist Party has long operated through regional party federations, and the jurisdictions of these federations now serve as the basis for determining the boundaries of Spain’s new federal states. It should be noted that, while Spain is now officially a communist country and the borders of the states are determined by the federations of the Communist Party, the constitution does not explicitly relegate governance of the states to the party. Regardless, this new organization of the government has given hope to regionalists, especially given many Communist Party federations’ ties to regionalist movements, bringing a much-welcomed quiet to the recent chaos of separatism."

Now in one fell swoop, destroying the reactionaries hopes, the General Secretary has now signed legislation to have the King and his family exiled from the country to a destination of their choosing. Having boarded the plane in the early hours of the morning, the King has now sacrificed any chances of his restoration after publicly declaring the legislation was agreed to by himself and his heirs. With a small crowd gathering to see the momentous occasion at Madrid–Barajas airport, jubilant celebrations have erupted across the country with millions satisfied that the symbol of the bourgeois dictatorship is at last gone.

Despite being a member since his teenage years, Francisco Frutos has, until now, been of no significance within the party choosing to leave internal politics to men more capable than himself. Yet, the collapse of unity in the committee has now forced his hand with a recent speech gaining him the backing of several members. Denouncing the indecision, which he claims was caused by revisionists seeking to strengthen the growing fascist movements, the eighth round of voting saw Frutos receive nearly ten percent of the vote. By the tenth vote, several candidates had unexpectedly dropped out stating that they were instead backing Frutos, refusing to comment further these candidates have now once more faded into obscurity, consistently voting for Frutos.

Whilst not all agreed, with two having now been removed from the committee by President Frutos shortly after his election on the grounds of aiding the fascist restoration, the committee eventually came around with Frutos achieving ninety-two percent of the vote. With such dominance over the committee, President Frutos has now announced his plans to end the fascist menace spreading across the nation, however, such details as to how he plans to do this have been left off of the record for the time being.

Whilst unions are entirely a working-class movement the hope is that through the significant powers held by them, both rich and poor will welcome the status quo as each local trade union places their regions first and the state second. Such prioritization has also inspired hope that the years of separatism will, at last, come to an end, with there already being some truth to this belief. In regions where the centralization of the state significantly weakened the peoples living there, trade unions have already begun to reverse the policies after a short debate. This reversal has now allowed for the restoration of language and cultural protection rights demonstrating to the most ardent separatist that the trade unions are attempting to rebuild Spain from the ground up, effectively ending the divisions present for centuries."

Secessionist movements have long plagued the Spanish system, largely in part due to the actions of Franco and his successors, and through this level of devolution, it is hoped the crimes of our past can begin to be washed away. However, many have instead suggested that the bill does not go far enough if we are to atone for the reprehensible actions of Franco’s regime. More radical elements within parliament have suggested that Andalusia, the Canaries and Asturias be granted the same type of devolved powers.

However, there is another group that feels that it is the King’s duty to complete the democratization process that his father began. To that end, a coalition has been proposed to oversee the completion of a democratic constitution, led by the People’s Party and supported by One Spain, the moderate conservative party founded by ex-Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy.

If the King willed it, which many believe he does, this ban could be instantly lifted allowing for a plethora of voices to fill the halls of government. However, such a plan would also legalize many known republican parties, plunging the government into chaos should this opposition gain a majority. Therefore, the King would be within his right to maintain this ban only allowing parties loyal to the monarchy to stand in future elections. Whilst this decision may be unpopular, should it be enacted, the monarchy as an institution would be preserved allowing for Felipe to continue his rule unchallenged.

Understanding these views, the Prime Minister has stated that the nation should not be fearful of this change believing that these radicals shall never grow powerful enough to bring down democracy so long as the people remain united behind the foundations of the new republic."

Recognizing our current weakness, these rebels have begun to storm police stations and military bases arming themselves to the point that they can now match our firepower. However, one thing these rebels are currently lacking is cohesion and unity. If the decision is granted to mobilize the local civil guard units immediately, there is a possibility that we shall be able to rout these terrorists and secure control of our African gem once more. Casualties will no doubt be significant, however, if we desire to secure Africa and maintain any international presence then no sacrifice is too great. Yet, whilst securing Africa may be a significant priority, securing the continuation of our government is desirable. Rather than mobilize these guards and ship significant equipment over to replenish their lost arsenal, many have instead suggested letting Equatorial Guinea fall so that the mainland can be free of our enemies."

Likely being armed with heavy equipment by their revolutionary neighbors, this escalation has not gone unnoticed by our government with many demanding that an immediate declaration of war be issued to retake our prized colony. With ships already prepared and packed with loyal conscripts, to set sail to Africa there is an eager feeling by many to reclaim the territory from the rebels. However, many more are continuing to argue that any attempts to reclaim the territory would be a fruitless endeavor with these soldiers, planes and tanks needed to defend against the ongoing assaults on our frontlines in Spain. Whilst this may be true, the loss of Equatorial Guinea places our nation at great risk of declining further into international obscurity, with the port in Bata being a significant jumping-off point for trade. A decision must be made quickly, for the longer our government debates intervention the quicker our soldiers who are ready to go and fight become demoralized, making their aid in either Africa or Spain worthless."

With our position now lost to these rebels, many have demanded we restore order to our colony believing that its loss will significantly hamper the ability of the state to trade internationally once the war has been won. However, with the speed and precision that the rebels have fought, some are concerned that any landings in the colony will fail and instead believe that once again we should prioritize the homefront regardless of the loss of prestige this may deal to our government.

The King’s advisors in the military have been somewhat apprehensive towards this approach, feeling that it is too risky and breaks the image of royalty being above the common people. Worse still is the fact that the King’s father was a communist, and this direct interfacing with the country’s leftist agitators has instilled in many military higher-ups a worry that Carlos Javier may yet follow in his father’s red footsteps. Nevertheless, the King’s approach seems to be paying off, with the people on the streets beginning to believe that the King will indeed take an active interest in fulfilling their demands and improving their lives.

While he has repeatedly declared his condemnations of the Second Spanish Republic, he has now also condemned the Carlists that collaborated with Francisco Franco, citing their fascistic and unitary tendencies and their support for the non-Carlist former king Alfonso XIII as open betrayals of the traditions of Carlist heritage. Instead, he has attempted to rehabilitate the image of the Carlists of the 19th century, claiming that their initial revolt was based not just around Don Carlos’ hunger for power, but from an opposition to centralization and capitalism. In this light, King Carlos Javier I has argued that the Carlists of the 19th century were progressive, proto-socialist warriors, fighting against the creation of the Castillian supremacist, capitalist oligarchy that was created in the wake of the Carlists’ defeat in the Carlist Wars.

In keeping with this tradition, King Carlos Javier I is creating a new royal lottery. Every year from this point forward, one lucky winner will be chosen from the Spanish populace, who will be welcomed into the royal palace for a lavish feast with the King himself and be presented with a generous sum of money, a portion of which will be invested into the winner’s home community in fashion of their choice. While some of these costs will come out of the pockets of the state, this initiative is largely funded by mandatory “donations” from the country’s most successful businesses.

Having been placed in the Valley by those loyal to him, to ensure he would be able to rest forever alongside those he fought with during his so-called ‘Glorious Crusade’. After much debate, the government has now decided to exhume Franco’s remains denying his followers the ability to desecrate the memory of the dead through the politicization of the monument. Citing the increased gatherings as justification, with most turning into political rallies denouncing the alleged Marxist government's election and policies, Franco’s remains have now been transferred to Mingorrubio Cemetery where he was reburied next to his wife, Carmen Polo. Whilst celebrations have begun across the nation, many are now happy that the Valley of the Fallen can begin to reflect the unity of Spain and allow the lines between Nationalists and Republicans to be blurred.

While supporters claim that this will ensure a progressive Spain and a unified and powerful left, it has sparked several protests from supporters of the opposition throughout the country. This comes primarily from the Popular Union and National Democracy parties, who view this coalition as a betrayal of Spain’s democracy and an open door to communist takeover. While most historians internationally dispute the idea that the Communist Party ever planned to coup the government during the Popular Front of 1936 to 1939, it still remains a popular theory among many conservatives and liberals, resulting in slogans and chants denouncing the government for setting Spain on the path of Red Terror.

Considering how most of those who have been bold enough to resist a fascist regime back in the day are now dead, either by the hands of Franco or just old age, this mass pardoning stands as a rather symbolic decision, aimed at bringing justice to victim families and further erasing the legacy of a bygone dictator.

Nevertheless, this new coalition with the right has proven controversial with some voters, who disapprove of the openly monarchist political affiliations of One Spain and the People’s Party. In light of this, Popular Union’s leadership have openly addressed their ongoing commitment to republicanism, and supporters have implied that the discourse regarding monarchism is irrelevant because One Spain and the People’s Party will never manage to gain enough support to form a government anyways, so this alliance is purely in the interest of liberalism and forming security against the socialists."

While it does provide significant incentives for so-called “high value,” it also increases costs for immigration, allowing the state to profit off of immigrants. This obviously means that it is more difficult for lower income people to immigrate to Spain. Portions of the far right have been frustrated by this policy from the outset, believing that talent from within Spain should be prioritized, while the left has been angered by the blatantly classist and implicitly racist undertones of the law’s actual implementation. Nevertheless, the bulk of Popular Union’s supporters are content with the law. It remains to be seen how popular and effective the law will prove in the long term, but for now what’s done is done."

This new party, Iglesias has hoped, will finally be able to operate without the constraints that the moderates within the PSOE had placed on his faction once before stating that he is prepared to take radical action to ensure socialism comes to Spain within the next few years. Whilst there are many who have already backed Iglesias for his defiant action in breaking from the moderates, who have been left significantly weakened by this development, there are many more who have grown concerned that this break in the left coalition will now make it near impossible for the left to win an election given that now its base is split into two. Dismissing these beliefs as nonsensical, proudly stating that his party will be able to achieve victory in any election it stands in, Iglesias has now ruled out working with either the Workers Party or the Popular Union effectively destroying any semblance of unity that had existed within the Left Coalition. Now as each faction disintegrates into its own party once more, it is only a matter of time before the government collapses."

Immediately stating that the People’s Party could not hope to win an election in the future, stating that their party’s continued support for the monarchy has placed them at the fringe of politics, Rivera has promised to uphold many of the values held by the People’s Party stopping short at calling for the restoration of monarchical powers seen before the civil war. Whilst dismissive of this alliance at first, believing that the Left Coalition had caused enough damage to the nation for the People’s Party to win a significant number of seats in any general election, Rivera’s continued reasoning was able to convince many moderates who had been granted a look into his initial manifesto drafts. Having demonstrated a clear ideological break with the left, Rivera soon after finalized negotiations with the People’s Party with its leadership now expected to announce its support for the Popular Union in the coming days."

Once viewed by former Prime Minister [Root.Getleader] as a mere fringe group that would never amount to anything so long as the people held their belief in democracy, Manuel Canduela Serrano has now seen a steady rise in the polls after the recent breakdown of the government. Attracting thousands to his cause, the populist has held speeches across the nation promising stability and a return to the conservative policies of the past. Even though his movement has now engaged in street brawls with anti-fascists, Serrano’s polling has remained steady as many see him as the manifestation of stability. Unless polls change within the immediate future, Serrano would become a necessary ally to any trying to form a government.

With electoral campaigning now officially beginning, though all members of the Left Coalition had been campaigning across the nation prior to this announcement, the nation now prepares for its first real taste of democracy. Whilst many are hopeful that this snap election shall end the instability, others are not as sure believing that the rise of the reactionary right and communist’s reaction against them in the streets will not be resolved via a parliamentary majority.

However, despite his best intentions, one member of the People’s Party was quick to reject his offer claiming that this is precisely the reason he had failed as Prime Minister before as he was too afraid to stick up for his own values. Doing his best to stay calm, Rajoy was quickly overwhelmed by emotion and responded by stating that whilst he may have failed in his duties as Prime Minister at least he was not a spineless bootlicker to the monarchy. Offended by these claims, the People’s Party quickly attempted to have Rajoy expelled from the chambers, and when their attempts failed several dedicated party members crossed over to try and assault the party leader.

It has also been rumored, though not confirmed, that some unions have also taken action in these protests encouraging workers to participate in walkouts crippling the government even further. Hesitant to give in to these protestors, the King has now met with the Prime Minister to hopefully resolve the crisis in parliament and force through an acceptable compromise. However, the time for such compromise has seemingly passed as neither the People’s Party nor One Spain is willing to cooperate on any matter.

The National Democracy Party, led by Manuel Canduela Serrano, has claimed to represent the silent majority that is opposed to both socialism and reactionary politics of the Right Coalition. Gathering a significant base of republicans, conservatives and fascists, National Democracy has been able to run a populist tour of the nation stirring up hatred for the monarchy claiming it to be a waste of money and then traveling to the French and Portuguese borders rejecting all forms of immigration. To make matters worse for the government, some of our own base has been fooled by Serrano’s rhetoric believing him to be the only salvation for the Spanish economy due to his undying loyalty to laissez-faire economics. Having claimed to be a libertarian, despite his party professing their loyalty to Franco, Serrano has only been able to achieve such success because he has been untainted by the ongoing crisis of conservatism in government. Unless the Right Coalition is able to regroup soon and reestablish itself as the true voice of conservatism, National Democracy may soon usurp its title of the voice of the right and begin a drastic political shift in the nation."

Whilst neither agrees that such an election would be any beneficial, instead hoping to unite the coalition once more and see out the parliamentary term, the situation across the nation has proven this may not be possible. As each day passes, the government grows further divided and the people grow more united presenting an impossible challenge for the Prime Minister who merely wishes to see order restored to the country. Concluding their meetings with the King, the two have agreed that if the nation is to avoid the outbreak of either another civil war or the declaration of a second general strike a snap election must be called immediately.

With this gratitude in place, the King then addressed what many had wished to hear him justify to begin with. Arguing that the drug of socialism was as tempting as all others, Enrique urged the nation to look beyond the lines of succession and into the wider world pointing to the atrocities of Moscow and Europe in their pursuit of utopia. Stopping short of suggesting that his nephew would ever stoop to the atrocities seen across the border, the King staunchly defended his statements questioning the paradoxical nature of a man who professes his faith to both Marx and the Lord. Pledging that his rule would be just as equal as his nephews, Enrique ended his address asking the nation to think on this matter and come to their own conclusions.

Whilst this initially sparked concern that the King had authorized the beginning of a new schism in Christianity, the legislation passed details that the fundamentals of Catholicism must be present in all sermons given, with the outlying factor being that the interpretation of texts and teachings can differ from church to church. Alongside this, bishops have now been granted further autonomy from the Holy See in the hopes of establishing a more fair and representative vision of the Lord’s true faith on Earth. Still recognizing the Pope as the official head of the Church and all of Catholicism, the King has hoped that His Holiness will recognize this turn as one of necessity in order for Catholicism to modernize and not become washed away in the tides of history."

Claiming that no leader since Ferdinand VII can claim to have had the respect, authority, or legitimacy of the people during their rule Enrique has effectively wiped the slate clean regarding all leaders over the past two centuries as either illegitimate or traitors to Madrid. Though the military had hoped Enrique would have avoided discussing Franco, believing his rule to have been essential to the formation of modern-day Spain, the King did not hesitate to denounce Caudillo as an instigator of the pretenders to the throne and a traitor to the Spanish people. Despite this strong denunciation the King has seen a small increase in support from various anti-Francoist movements, although harboring anti-royalist intent, are pleased that the Kingdom has now severed the cord with the fascistic past potentially allowing for a revived and renewed Spanish identity. Refusing to agree with these movements, the King insisted that the denunciation was done solely to remind all that the legitimate rulers of Spain had now returned in full force and that treachery would never again be tolerated."

They believe that it is far too convenient and beneficial for the Spanish government to simply be a coincidence and that the idea is ludicrous. The European Union has issued an official condemnation of what [GER.GetLeader] has called “unsurprising yet saddening fascist violations of human rights”. This disappearance has, surprising no one, resulted in the general strike starting to fizzle out, as those who gave it momentum are no longer present. The remnants of the protest movement continue to express their anger, but their numbers dwindle as many wonder if protest is worth the risk. This has had the fortunate effect of greatly aiding the Spanish economy, which has been straining under the burden of the general strike. As such, the economy is beginning to rebound, and government control of the economy is beginning to increase.

As such, the new Caudillo of Spain, Bencomo, has decided to meet with some of the protestors, particularly those close in ideology to the government, in order to defuse tensions and perhaps appease the more moderate protestors. Speaking to protestors, Bencomo reportedly spoke about order and civility being restored to Spain, declaring that for all of his disagreements with the protestors, both he and they are Spaniards, and that all Spaniards deserve at least a voice. He also reportedly offered some minor concessions, promising lofty things such as “order and strength” and “tolerance, but only of allies of the Spanish State”. It is unclear what, if anything, these vague promises actually mean. Bucher, the leader of the Francoist military clique within the Spanish nation, who had previously been very supportive of Bencomo’s government, reportedly showed great anger when he heard about this. It seems that he may have preferred a more radical approach to the protests, a crackdown using the army. Prominent republicans such as Pablo Iglesias have also condemned this, expounding that any concessions will merely be temporary, simply for the purpose of appeasing the protestors, as opposed to heralding any real change. Despite their protestations, it seems that popular support for the protests is beginning to fizzle out."

As anticipated, the meeting opened with several topics of debate between the various groups that had agreed to attend with many believing it would be impossible to come to any sort of agreement and form the coalition. With some questioning if the 1958 Movimiento Nacional doctrine could easily be replicated in modern Spain, a fierce debate raged throughout the halls of government. Despite the initial worry, the meeting ended with the reaffirmation of support for the 1958 doctrine as all in attendance realized the necessity of immediate stability, something that could not occur if the government was battling itself over the intricacies of constitutional reform."

Juan Carlos was a strong and powerful leader, but even he had difficulty preventing these many problems from ruining the nation, ultimately causing a disaster. Felipe, with his cowardice and attempts at democratic reform, completely failed. His disastrous faith in “the will of the people” proved to be the nation’s undoing.

We are the heirs of a proud legacy, and we must not allow these weak and predatory Communists to subvert the work of all true and strong Spaniards.” Following this, it was announced that [Root.GetLeader] and his military administration had legalized the use of lethal force against protestors in order to combat the ruinous effects of the general strike, and to “subvert Communist agitation”, as the authorization described its purpose. Critics of the government say that this authorization is not necessary and that the government should instead have handled the matter peacefully. But their pleas have clearly fallen on deaf ears.

Whilst the restoration of a monarch to the throne would be widely supported across the nation, even if this monarchy is purely a figurehead lacking any power, Felipe himself is still hated within the military and across some parts of the country. Whilst he is the rightful King of the nation, his restoration may be too much of a political headache for the government to handle, meaning that a second candidate has to be considered. Once more, the Carlist claimant has been raised by some within the government who state that their opposition to the House of Bourbon-Anjou provides them with the perfect credentials to be crowned. However, abandoning the house of Juan Carlos may be a step too far and Felipe could always become a useful tool further down the line if he denounces his past mistakes."

Having reached out to his son, Carlos Javier, in the hopes of having him denounce these claims the military has begun to consider they made a mistake in pursuing the Carlist claimant. Having heard no response from Javier, with the heir refusing to even speak to our government the search was nearly abandoned with many considering that Felipe should instead just be reinstalled ensuring a sense of legitimacy on the throne. However, after searching further a suitable candidate has now been found. Henry Sixtus, the uncle of Carlos Javier, has proven himself to be a loyal and eager candidate proclaiming his support for the government and recognizing the necessity of our actions against Felipe.

Though the Socialist Party was not the least likely contender, most observers and citizens had expected either the People’s Party or One Spain to achieve a victory. It would seem that King Felipe VI was among the people who expected a right-wing victory. Shortly after the results of Spain’s first free election since 1936 came in, the King recorded an unexpected declaration from the Royal Palace. Announcing that he “could not allow Marxism to infest Spain’s newly fledged democracy”, the King stated that he would not allow the Socialist Party to form a government, despite the Socialist Party having abandoned Marxism in 1979. While the constitution does technically place the certification of election results in the hands of the King, it also legally requires the winning party or coalition to be allowed to form a government. Public response to Felipe’s decision has been overwhelmingly negative across Spain’s political scene, with even historically conservative parties and organizations criticizing the King’s actions.

Rajoy has stated multiple times that, despite his many disagreements with the Socialist Party, they are still the rightful victors of the elections and should have the right to form a government. However, it would seem that Rajoy’s opposition to the King’s declaration has had no effect, as earlier today, Rajoy traveled to the Royal Palace to have a personal meeting with King Felipe VI, and Rajoy’s hopes that the King would listen to a fellow conservative would be dashed. Despite numerous attempts to convince Felipe that allowing a Socialist Party government was an unfortunate necessity, the King actively refused to compromise. The meeting between the King and the former PM quickly escalated, with the King reportedly using coarse language numerous times before storming off, visibly furious.

The streets are flooded with people, chanting anti-Felipe slogans and waving Republican flags; the city’s police are overworked and stretched thin, and in the streets leading to the Royal Palace, large barricades have been erected to prevent rioters from storming the Palace and attacking the King. Images of these barricades, as well as the general unrest in Madrid, have spread across intranets throughout the world, alarming many international observers. The Madrid Municipal Police have been quick to hold a press conference, where the Municipal Police’s Commissioner General has attempted to assuage fears that the riots are getting too out of hand for the police.

According to the reports, Felipe described the riots as “tantamount to a civil war” and urgently requested the military to put down the widespread protests and restore order to Spain before new elections could be called. However it would seem the request for military intervention was almost immediately met with refusal from the Spanish Military’s high command, who seem to be in agreement with the majority of the Spanish population that the King’s attempt to overturn the election is illegal. Regardless, the report indicates the military has still partially reaffirmed loyalty to the royal family, vowing to protect them in the event that violence is committed directly against Felipe or Spain’s royal institutions.

Carlos Javier has been relatively quiet in recent history, seldom getting involved in politics, and so this open statement has shocked many. Also surprising were Carlos Javier’s strong words condemning “any and all who would stand in the way of the democratic process,” a sentiment that runs counter to the typical association of Carlism with autocracy. Carlos Javier also thanked Mariano Rajoy for taking a stance against the crown, and offered his own symbolic recognition of the Socialist Party as the rightful government of Spain.

Additionally, in the process of this televised meeting, Narbona and Carlos Javier explored the history of the Carlist movement, with Carlos Javier swearing to steer the movement away from radicalism and towards a renewed constitutionalism. This part of the address seems to have damaged Carlos Javier’s image in the eyes of many traditional Carlists, driving them to denounce Carlos Javier and endorse his openly reactionary uncle, Sixtus Henry.

In addition to Narbona, Mariano Rajoy has also endorsed this plan, seeing it as the politically expedient method to solving the crisis.

With the object of their frustrations having vanished, the angry masses of protesters have been left aimless. While many have still chosen to gather outside the parliament building to demand action from the government, the majority of people have elected to return to their lives. As this tense calm has set over Spain, the Civil Guard has set about dismantling the barricades that had been erected to keep the King safe during the height of the protests. With the barricades gone and vehicle and pedestrian traffic returning to the streets of Madrid, this overwhelming political movement seems to be winding to a close in the hearts and minds of the populace. As life returns to normal, the future of Spain now lies in the parliament."

spain.145.d:0 "After much anticipation from the people of Spain, Carlos Javier I, heir apparent to the Carlist claim to the throne of Spain, was officially sworn in as Spain’s king this morning. This comes in the wake of parliament officially recognizing Felipe VI’s flight from the country as an act of abdication. Most people appear to be satisfied with this change in the royal palace, as Carlos Javier became well liked during the election crisis for his unequivocal support for the democratic process and the legitimately elected Socialist Party. In his first act as King, Carlos Javier I officially recognized the results of the election, and named Socialist Party leader Cristina Narbona as Prime Minister, inviting her to form a government. However, this coronation has not been without its critics. While they remain a minority, there are still those that supported Felipe VI as the rightful King of Spain, even after his undemocratic actions. But more common than these “Felipistas” are those that had hoped that the abdication of the king would result in the creation of a third Spanish Republic. In response to these Republican frustrations, the government has explained that reorganizing the country into a republic would be too difficult and too divisive of a process to initiate in the midst of the turmoil that has already gripped Spain since the death of King Juan Carlos I."

spain.146.d:0 "While National Democracy appears to have handily won the recent snap elections, King Felipe VI has put himself in the way of the party’s attempts to form a government. The King has refused to certify the results of the election and invite the party to form a government. This has brought about a bit of a constitutional crisis. The constitution states that all elected governments require the invitation of the King, however, it also states that whichever party gets the largest number of votes in the general elections will be allowed to attempt to form a government. This contradiction in the constitution is the direct result of One Spain and the People’s Party having drastically different views on the future of Spain during the drafting of the constitution, and legal scholars had noted at the time of its ratification that it was guaranteed to result in a crisis eventually. This crisis has divided parliament and the people of Spain itself. On one hand, those that voted for National Democracy are furious, but things become murky beyond that demographic. The party is highly controversial, being avowedly anti-monarchist as well as having ties to the Franco regime and Falangist and Neo-Nazi movements, and many voters find themselves caught between their faith in democracy and their fear of this far-right political party."

An elder statesman and former prime minister who had resigned under King Juan Carlos due to the King’s refusal to politically liberalize in any way, Rajoy holds the political respect of many Spaniards. Today, Rajoy met with Felipe, attempting to convince him to respect the results of the election, even though it could give power to a party committed to attacking the powers of the King. It bears mention that Rajoy has spoken at length to the media in the past that he holds no love for National Democracy, resenting their illiberal politics and their ties to the far right. Despite this, he has told journalists that, during this political crisis, he will not give in until Felipe concedes to upholding the democratic process, regardless of how unsavory the electoral winners might be. However, concessions seem unlikely from Felipe, who has now publicly criticized Rajoy for advocating for the rights of an “extremist” political party."

Serrano took particular offense to the King’s hypocritical attitudes towards democracy, saying Felipe only supports it ‘when it suits his liberal agenda’, then throws it out the moment it fails to do so. Serrano also questioned the continued viability of the monarchy’s place within Spain’s fledgling democracy, stating that it was evident to him that the monarchy’s role would have to be ‘reevaluated’ in terms of its compatibility with a democratic Spain. Conservatives across the country have been split between their loyalty to the monarchy and their disdain for liberalism.

While there are still those among the Civil Guard that agree with the King’s decision, seeing National Democracy as both anti-monarchist and overtly bigoted, the number of high-ranking officers voicing their support for the party seems to be indicative of a general feeling of frustration among Spain’s military and police services towards the monarchy as it exists.

While this position has played a major role in drawing the ire of King Felipe over the last few weeks, the party has regarded the abolition of the monarchy as a secondary goal. However, in the wake of the turmoil following the recent elections and the popular outpouring of anger towards Felipe for his anti-democratic actions, National Democracy party leader Manuel Canduela Serrano and his allies have taken to impromptu stages across the country to publicly call for the abolition of the monarchy and the deposition of King Felipe. “Since assuming the throne, Felipe has shown us nothing but incompetence,” Canduela Serrano shouted in a televised rally, “Now, the crown stands in the way of democracy. Its institution and its wearer must both face judgment for their criminal nature.” These rallies have drawn major crowds in cities and towns across the country, and onsite interviews seem to suggest that many throughout the country agree with Canduela Serrano’s condemnation of the King."

The Civil Guard leaders that organized this coup have, in the meantime, invited Manuel Canduela Serrano and National Democracy to form a government as the constitution states that they should have been allowed to do weeks ago. Unsurprisingly, Canduela Serrano has accepted, assembling a majority government of exclusively National Democracy party leaders. An emergency session of parliament has been called, which will not include the monarchist parties of One Spain or the People’s Party, and the immediate question on the table is the matter of the crown and the constitution."

From this day forward, Felipe is formally stripped of all titles and confined to house arrest in his Asturias summer home for the rest of his natural life. His family may visit, but he may not leave. Simultaneously, in the wake of a series of parliamentary hearings, the prime minister has, expectedly, moved to pardon all Civil Guard leaders involved in the deposition of the monarchy, arguing that they were doing their civic duty to constitution then in place as well as the one that has since been enacted. Prime Minister Canduela Serrano has also issued official pardons for Mariano Rajoy, Santiago Abascal, and the rest of the monarchist politicians that were detained during the Civil Guard’s coup. Following this pardon, these politicians were allowed to return to their parliamentary duties. While this act of mercy has been well-received by the public, opinion polls by and large suggest that monarchist parties like One Spain and the People’s Party may have been irreparably damaged in the eyes of the public by their association with the fallen crown."

Rather than being invited to form a government by a King or President, the Prime Minister will always be the chosen leader of whichever party wins the most seats in parliament. To encourage majorities, the constitution also outlines a winner-takes-most election style, wherein the party that receives the most votes in a given constituency is entitled to at least 75% of the parliamentary seats assigned to that constituency. As the name implies, the Spanish Unitary Republic is a strictly unitary system, with no autonomy whatsoever afforded to Spain’s various provinces. Obviously, this constitution is controversial with actors from across the political spectrum, and only National Democracy and a handful of small far-right allies voted for it. However, with the monarchist parties suspended from parliamentary participation for the time being, National Democracy’s parliamentary majority was transformed into a supermajority, ensuring the enactment of the new constitution. Amidst the excitement around the creation of the Unitary Republic, a series of trials and hearings have also been scheduled for the coming days to ensure that justice is rendered upon the former monarch and his allies."

Startled, the meeting was quickly suspended with Bucher and his allies gathering in private to discuss the implications of Javier’s ascension should he become King. Whilst many have respected his refusal, seeing it as a careful means to keep his father's legacy alive and proving he would not be as feeble as Felipe was, there are others who have insisted Enrique be contacted immediately to become the new Spanish King.

With businesses and the media also facing hefty penalties should they display signs in Catalan, Basque, Galician, or any other minority language, it is hoped that this legislation will remind the nation who is truly in charge of the nation and that any hopes of autonomy or independence are mere fantasy.

However, despite this opposition, with tensions mounting between the Caudillo and the monarch, the decision has been broadly accepted as a necessary one by the slimmest majority, with many viewing the monarchy as being directly opposed to the Falangist vision for Spain. While a compromise was suggested, with Felipe stating he would happily step down in place of his daughter Leonor, such a compromise has since been rejected, with Bencomo recognizing that any royal would ultimately be controlled by Felipe from the shadows.

However, this split has wounded Spain’s leftist movement, with many of the Marxists leaving the party, and their descendents creating the United Labor Party, which now serves to electorally divide the left. While we have outperformed them electorally for the time being, the Marxists represent a substantial constituency that we must endeavor to recapture. To that end, our party has chosen to reintroduce aspects of Marxism to our party’s programs and rhetoric, and has begun to establish more concrete connections with the United Labor Party. The ultimate goal of this is the consolidation of Spain’s leftist forces and the reunification of the PSOE, which will help to secure our dominance over the socialist movement and to form a bulwark against the reactionary parties of the right."

Presenting it as a means to crack down on rampant violent crime, the act now includes crimes such as armed robbery, murder, rape, child molestation, and countless more heinous deeds as justifiable reasons for execution. Though most of the public does not seem to disagree with how awful those crimes are, many still deem the new punishment too harsh, referring to this set of laws as draconian. While some experienced lawmen think that the expansion will only result in more violence, as from now on, a violent criminal who otherwise wouldn’t have, will go ahead and kill every witness to avoid being caught and receiving a death penalty, the government overall supports the decision, predicting the significant drop in crime rates and the reduced economic burden on our prison industry. With the positive effects of this law expected to reveal themselves over the coming months, the streets already seem much calmer just hours after the announcement, leaving the nation to wonder if the long-term consequences will be just as good."

Having declared that the PSOE had become tainted by the stain of monarchism, with its protests now slowly turning in favor of constitutional monarchism in an attempt to appeal to the masses, the renowned socialist has now cut all ties with his former party and declared the establishment of the United Labor Party. Though largely identical to the PSOE, Iglesias has assured those who have joined him that the party will not betray the people and become folly to the renewed wave of monarchism. Denouncing the PSOE in a fiery speech, Iglesias has become the voice of the radical left with many communists willingly declaring their support for his approach to politics saying they would openly endorse him in upcoming elections. However, such an endorsement has had significant disadvantages for Iglesias who has now only been successful in attracting the most radical members of the protest movement to his side. With the leftist vote now split, the government can breathe a sigh of relief knowing that the Right Coalition will continue to dominate politics for years to come."

Unsurprisingly, officials of the UGT make up the bulk of the president’s nominations, but some observers have been surprised by Álvarez’s nomination of members of the anarchist CNT to several cabinet positions. The relations between the UGT and the CNT have historically been bipolar, varying from antagonistic opposition to cooperation so close that it edged near the unification of the two syndicates. To justify his decision to include the CNT in his government, Álvarez has explained that he wants to foster a new era of friendship between labor organizations, and has claimed that he would have also appointed members of the CCOO if the Communist Party had not explicitly barred them from participating in this government. From a more pragmatic viewpoint, it seems likely that Álvarez is also attempting to welcome the CNT into government to discourage them from returning to their revolutionary attempts at dismantling the state. Welcomed into the government, the CNT will have a harder time denouncing the new state as “bourgeois” without alienating many of its members. Under this scrutiny, the CNT has accepted Álvarez’s nominations, officially creating a new era of alliance between the CNT and UGT on a level not seen since 1937. The alliance has come to be referred to as the “Intersyndicale Alliance” in many circles, although this name remains unofficial."

The USO was originally founded in the 1960s as an alliance of illegal trade unions that opposed Francoist rule. Unlike the various other syndicates that opposed Francoist rule, such as the syndicalist UGT, the anarchist CNT, and the communist CCOO, the USO has always been guided by a Catholic world outlook, albeit one that focuses on the Catholic teachings of social justice and dignified work. Like the other syndicates, the USO still endorses secularism, socialism, and workers’ self-management, but is otherwise far less anti-clerical than its larger counterparts. The massive rise in the number of workers associated with the USO is almost certainly the result of large numbers of Catholic conservatives being forced to join unions. While many within the current administration worry that the influx of rightists into the USO could effectively transform the syndicate into a reactionary force within our revolutionary state, the leadership of the syndicate has assured the government that its goal first and foremost is to politically educate the masses of bourgeois-minded voters, and expressed their eagerness to cooperate with the other major syndicates in building a socialist future for the country."

Now that our government has made a decisive break with electoral politics, it appears that the CCOO has been emboldened, seeing itself as now having the political advantage over the Communist Party. This morning the CCOO met with President Álvarez and several other government officials to discuss joining the UGT-CNT governing alliance, sparking outrage from the Communist Party leadership. To the government, the CCOO has stressed that, while they remain committed to Leninist ideology, they have recognized the new institutions of the state as sufficiently progressive and socialist and wish to contribute to this revolutionary new government despite their disagreements with some of its methodologies. The conclusion of the meeting welcomed the CCOO into the governing coalition with the UGT and CNT, with the new UGT-CNT-CCOO government officially adopting the title of “Intersyndicale Alliance.” The Communist Party has denounced this decision and officially expelled the CCOO’s leadership from the party. In turn, the CCOO has codified its independence from the Communist Party in much the same way that the UGT formalized its independence from the Socialist Workers’ Party decades ago. A small but significant segment of workers have abandoned the CCOO in opposition to this break with the Communist Party, but it seems that the syndicate at large is happy to be affiliated with the new workers’ government and the Intersyndicale Alliance."

After much deliberation and argument, the party decided to once more adhere to Marxism as its guiding ideology. Immediately after this decision was made public, the PSOE and the United Labor Party announced a special joint congress to  discuss the critical topic of unification of the two parties. After many days of negotiations, a consensus has at last  been reached. The United Labor Party has officially dissolved, with its members joining the rejuvenated PSOE. Prime Minister [ROOT.GetLeader] has, as a result of the negotiations, been named as the new General Secretary of the Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party.

In a historic moment of unity, the congress concluded with the official announcement that the United Labor Party was dissolving and its members joining the PSOE, the party from which they had originally split. All wings of the party have celebrated the brilliant leadership of General Secretary [ROOT.GetLeader], who has garnered much of the credit for this monumental achievement. With the two major parties of the left reunited at last, the future looks bright for the socialist cause in Spain. That said, there are still critics on the left who remain dissatisfied with this merger, seeing it as unnecessarily ceding too much ground to moderate left-liberals, and consequently metrics have shown that a small but noteworthy portion of United Labor Party members have refused to join the PSOE, and have instead defected to the Communist Party of Spain."

Going forward, the country is to be governed by the Intersyndical Parliament, a bicameral legislature composed of representatives of the country’s labor syndicates. Seats in the lower house of parliament are assigned to syndicates proportional to the number of workers affiliated to them throughout the country, while seats in the upper house are assigned to syndicates proportional to their strength in regional constituencies, with the boundaries of these constituencies being drawn along historical, cultural, and linguistic boundaries within the country. Broadly, the working classes of the country have happily accepted this new legislative body as a powerful governing body that will serve to bring about both syndicalist socialism and federalism as needed by the realities of Spain. While there are some who are frustrated by the lack of an executive office to mediate disputes within the legislature, most of those in power - especially representatives of the CNT - have argued that disposing of the executive position helps to better empower workers and prevent the excesses of the state. At present, all seats within the parliament are held by the representatives of the UGT, CNT, and CCOO syndicates, however, elections are to be held next month to more accurately distribute parliamentary seats in both houses to the country’s syndicates."

In an effort to show solidarity with organized labor, General Secretary [Root.GetLeader] has appointed several prominent union leaders into government positions. However, critics have been quick to point out that these leaders have been chosen almost exclusively from the Workers’ Commissions, better known as the CCOO, the Communist Party’s official labor syndicate, which emerged decades ago as a clandestine organization operating secretly within Sindicato Vertical. Nevertheless, the government has opened the door to negotiations with the country’s other major syndicates. The anarchist National Confederation of Labor, or CNT, has outright refused to collaborate with the new communist state, but the UGT, whilst divided, seems to be open to the prospect of negotiating a new alliance with the Communist Party."

With the CCOO now firmly under state control, the government has taken a bold move to ensure that all labor movements are aligned with the interests of the working class through an order that if a union wishes to remain active and supported by the government, it must register itself with the CCOO. For the General Union of Labor and other syndicates, this decision has been a slap across the face, with their frustration being understood as a lingering symptom of bourgeois influence within their ranks. Despite their historical significance, these unions have often been susceptible to reformist tendencies, wavering in their commitment to advancing the revolution. However, this consolidation is also viewed as an inevitable necessity for the forward march of socialism in Spain, a decision which, despite their lingering resentment, the UGT has been able to accept. As a result, prominent figures within the UGT have now been eyed up by the party to be welcomed into government, much like their allies within the strike movement, provided they are willing to swear loyalty to the revolution and accept the necessity of centralization of the unions."

While the Comisiones Obreras continues to receive preferential treatment as the state’s primary partner, other unions, including the Workers' General Union, Workers’ Syndical Union, and the National Confederation of Labor, have been granted legal permission to operate, albeit under strict registration requirements. The inclusion of these unions marks a calculated approach to foster broader collaboration between the government and the labor force. Though the CNT’s anarcho-syndicalist roots make it unlikely to align with state structures in practice, the gesture of legality has suggested a clearer effort to promote pluralism within the labor sector. However, many believe that the CNT’s reluctance to cooperate with the state renders its participation largely symbolic. Nonetheless, the policy shift has opened doors for union members to ascend into government roles, potentially reshaping the political landscape. By placing workers at the center of decision-making processes, the administration hopes to build a truly progressive labor policy that solidifies the state’s commitment to workers’ rights, wage equity, workplace safety, and the dream of twenty-first-century communism."

This marks a significant shift in the country’s political structure, allowing for the election of local governments in key regions, which many see as a concession to the growing demand for regional autonomy. By allowing regional governments to be elected, the state aims to appease regionalists and federalists who have long pushed for greater self-governance and local representation. This return to regional elections offers communities the ability to elect officials who are rooted in their localities, addressing the long-standing frustration over central government dominance. While the central government retains overarching authority, this development is seen as a pragmatic step to integrate the diverse political and cultural identities of Spain’s regions within the larger framework of a socialist state. Critics, however, warn that while the restoration of regional elections may appear to offer political freedom, the Communist Party of Spain is expected to continue exerting strong influence over these elections, ensuring that regional governments remain loyal to the state’s broader revolutionary goals."

Though the era of the Popular Front has faded from much of Europe, Spain has remained its torchbearer, consistently defending the ideals of socialism while opposing authoritarian rule under Franco, Juan Carlos, and Felipe’s monarchy. Now, with the PCE firmly in power, this alliance is being honored historically. The government is opening its ranks to other socialist factions, welcoming them into leadership roles and key governmental positions. These include long-standing members of the United Left, as well as socialist parties that, while historically distinct from the PCE, have shared a common goal of resisting right-wing repression and monarchist rule. By broadening the ideological base of the government, the PCE hopes to solidify its revolutionary mandate and present a united front both at home and internationally. The inclusion of these socialist forces is not just symbolic—it represents a practical move to consolidate power while maintaining the appearance of ideological inclusivity. However, critics warn that the PCE's dominant role may still limit the true influence of other socialist voices, creating a top-down structure that could limit the revolutionary potential of Spain’s broader socialist movement. Still, for now, the government's willingness to integrate and elevate its socialist allies demonstrates a commitment to honoring the legacy of Spain's resistance to fascism and the unbroken unity of left-wing forces in the face of decades of struggle."

spain.191.d:0 "In a sweeping move to restructure the military under the new government, the PCE has announced significant cuts to the defense budget, a decision that targets one of the country’s longest-standing issues: the excessive payment of military officers. Historically, high salaries for new senior offices have contributed to inefficiency and corruption within the armed forces, and the new leadership is determined to put an end to this injustice. The budget cuts have forced several senior staff members into early retirement, significantly reducing the top-heavy structure of Spain's military leadership. Notably, the retirements have disproportionately affected conservative officers, leading to speculation that these actions are more politically motivated than simply financial. Officers perceived as loyal to the old regime or critical of the communist government have been the most affected, while those with more progressive or PCE-aligned views seem to have been spared. This political favoritism has raised eyebrows within military circles, but it remains in line with the PCE's broader efforts to ensure ideological loyalty across all sectors of government and society. In addition to slashing payments, the PCE has introduced reforms that slow down the rate of promotions within the armed forces. These changes are intended to prevent the rapid career advancement that has long plagued Spain’s military hierarchy, where individuals quickly rose through the ranks, leading to a bloated officer corps. While the cuts have generated resistance from conservative factions within the military, the PCE’s reforms have been praised by some as a necessary step to modernize Spain’s armed forces and bring them in line with the party's revolutionary goals."

The implementation of these commissars has, however, seen mixed results. Pockets of resistance to socialism persist within certain brigades. These holdouts, often pockets of old military traditions and reactionary thought, have posed serious challenges to the commissars’ authority. However, the state’s resolve in rooting out such counter-revolutionary tendencies has been unyielding, with the worst offenders now facing swift and uncompromising justice- either through court-martial, arrest, or the firing squad. This purge has already had a chilling effect on dissent within the ranks, reinforcing the commissars' authority and the party’s control over the military. Despite the friction caused by these changes, the introduction of PCE commissars has significantly strengthened the ideological alignment of the military, curbed reactionary thought, and contributed towards the gradual modernization of the Spanish armed forces, with some now commenting that our progress puts us our armed forces at the same level and degree of professionalism as the late 1980s Warsaw Pact."

General Secretary [ROOT.Getleader] now stands as the de jure head of state and head of government, embodying both the political and executive power of the nation. This historic shift cements the dominance of the PCE over the entire political apparatus of the country, marking the final phase in the establishment of a Leninist state. The abolishment of competing parties likewise eliminates the last vestiges of bourgeois democracy, ensuring that Spain is now fully governed by and according to Marxist-Leninist principles. This centralization of power has been presented as a necessary step to safeguard the revolution and prevent counter-revolutionary forces from gaining a foothold once more within the Republic. With all political decision-making concentrated within the PCE, any form of dissent or opposition has been neutralized, leaving social democrats and other social fascists unable to operate within the government. Yet despite this concentration of power, the issue of factionalism has seemingly persisted, and while the General Secretary has commanded significant support from across the party, it is clear that elements of dissent are present with ministers from various government positions all seeking to gain the favor of the party and ensure that their vision of Leninism is secured, undermining the very principle of democratic centralism."

Effective immediately, all church property is being seized by the state, and the Catholic Church is no longer legally permitted to own land or operate churches. Monasteries, churches, and cathedrals are now being repurposed by the state for secular use, with many converted into schools, community centers, and government offices. Religious leaders, many of whom wielded significant influence, have been stripped of all their authority and, in some cases, detained for resisting the new mandate. The seizure of church wealth and land is being justified as a necessary move to combat the influence of reactionary and counter-revolutionary forces, which have been recently linked to church activity. However, this drastic measure has proven to be an unpopular one. Spain’s catholic identity runs deep, and for millions of citizens, the forced closure of churches and the banning of political practices feels like a direct assault on their personal beliefs and traditions. In cities such as Toldeo protests have erupted, with communities openly defying the ban by continuing to hold public and underground masses. While the move is, of course, necessary to ensure the teachings of Marx are upheld, some believe that this move may have only added to the lingering fascist sentiment that has persisted since the conclusion of the revolution."

Having made their address to the international community, where the General Secretary was able to present Spain as a reformed, stable, and progressive socialist state capable of participating in modern diplomacy, there was little pause as the chorus of applause from the socialist world came in as the surviving bastion of fascism in Europe had now been snuffed out, finally completing the European Spring that began in 1983.

Now, in a decisive move to correct this historic wrong, the General Secretary has announced the immediate integration of Equatorial Guinea, with the citizens of Equatorial Guinea being granted the same rights and protections as those on the mainland, joining in the struggle to build a classless society free from exploitation. While critics of this plan have labeled it colonialism in disguise, how can such accusations hold weight when we seek to liberate both the African and Spanish workers from the shackles of capitalism?

This measure represents a significant shift in the role of the various religious institutions found in the Republic, though notably the Catholic Church. Furthermore, the PCE has barred religious institutions from having any influence over education. Schools, universities, and any form of public institution must now be entirely secular, ensuring that religious teachings no longer dictate the curriculum. Despite these restrictions, the new policy does allow for religious freedom in practice. Catholics, Protestants, Muslims, Jews, and practitioners of any other faith are now freely permitted to establish places of worship and practice their religion, as long as they remain completely uninvolved in politics. This aspect of the reform is intended to ease tensions in the more diverse regions of Spain, where various religious communities have long sought equal treatment and protection under the law.

This sweeping reform has now addressed long-standing political, economic, and social issues that have dominated the Kingdom since the turn of the century, with the new laws tackling workplace discrimination, expanding access to healthcare, and ensuring equal treatment in marriage and family law, solidifying Spain’s shift towards an inclusive socialist society. This decision, however, has not come without its tensions. Traditionalist factions within the PCE have clung to their older interpretations of Marxist doctrines dismissing certain issues, namely the expansion of sexual minority rights, which has included the rights of transgender individuals, as a bourgeois distraction, and have attempted to resist the rapid pace of reform. However, their influence was no match for the overwhelming demand for change that has been brewing among younger party members, feminists, and sexual minority activists. The General Secretary themself, in an address to the nation, declared that the revolution was not merely economic but moral and that the liberation of all oppressed people—regardless of gender or sexuality—was integral to the country’s socialist vision, all but ending this little bout of resistance from our so-called comrades."

Farmers, particularly in rural and conservative regions, have reacted with the anger and frustration expected of these wreckers. For decades, they have operated with a level of independence, now, when the state decrees their land necessary for the survival of the Republic, they have suddenly grown a backbone and decried the revolution and its principles. While this has not become a widespread issue as of yet, with the loudest of voices quickly being silenced by our commissars in the region, the message of these farmers' submission has begun to spread, with many now believing that the implementation of collectivization will yield poorer quality produce and lead to a food scarcity should the ambitious project not be carefully managed.

While tasked with ensuring the smooth transition to collectivized farming, these officials have been accompanied by armed detachments of commissars, making abundantly clear the fate of those who resist.

Already discontent with the loss of their autonomy, farmers are now facing increased pressure to toe the line and accept their new reality while tensions are palpable, the enforcement of the integration has been a largely peaceful affair, with only four-hundred and twenty-six farmers arrested for seeking to bring harm to a member of the party. With it clear that the reactionaries are still present in the countryside, a permanent office has now been established by the party, with the Office of Agrarian Stability now standing as the vanguard for the rural communities, ensuring their safety from harm and overseeing the successful implementation of collectivization."

In response to the call, numerous countries from Western and Eastern Europe have offered assistance in establishing new industrial complexes throughout our Republic, marking a significant shift in our industrial landscape. The influx of foreign expertise aims to overhaul outdated systems of production, streamline industries, and introduce cutting-edge technologies only found in Europe. Experts from the industrial powerhouses of Europe, such as Germany and Italy are keen to play a pivotal role in upgrading our manufacturing, energy, and transportation infrastructures, aligning them closely with European standards. Among the most notable developments is the proposal to build state-of-the-art factories, focused on heavy industry, arms production, and automotive manufacturing. With the backing of foreign governments, Spain is expected to see rapid growth in its industrial output. Alongside these investments, foreign engineers and technicians are working alongside Spanish workers, exchanging knowledge and boosting the country’s technical proficiency. While the long-term benefits of these collaborations are eagerly anticipated, there are also concerns. Critics within the party have questioned whether the reliance on foreign expertise undermines Spain’s revolutionary goals, with some fearing it could lead to undue foreign influence on industries."

spain.205.d:0 "With an announcement from [SPR.GetLeader] today, perhaps a new step towards global leftist unity was taken, as the International Red Aid was officially revived as an organization. Having been originally founded with the Comintern efforts back in 1922, the organization was supposed to be a communist counterpart to the Red Cross, aimed at providing moral and material aid to ‘class war’ political prisoners worldwide, specifically organizing amnesty campaigns for those soon to be executed by the anticommunist dictatorships. International Red Aid saw its peak during the Spanish Civil War when it managed to establish numerous soup kitchens and refugee camps. However, with the removal of its greatest leader, Elena Stasova, and the defeat of the Spanish Republic, the organization sadly ceased to exist by 1941. Despite that, International Red Aid now breathes again, having been properly reestablished as an entity loyal to the Spanish government, with its headquarters now located in Madrid. From now on, whether it be a bloody guerilla war somewhere in Africa or a right-wing dictatorship at peace, International Red Aid representatives will always be there, not only saving the civilians but also nurturing loyal regimes and helping out the communist cause all over the globe."

While Franco's policies initially fueled a boom, they inevitably led to cyclical downturns that left the nation grappling with prolonged periods of recession, exacerbating social inequalities and despair under a royal autocracy. Under the banner of socialism, Spain is witnessing an unprecedented economic renaissance. Following the General Secretary’s plan and that of the models of Western Europe has now ushered in an economy that has prioritized collective ownership and state oversight, fostering a resilient economy insulated from the erratic swings of the global market. By redistributing wealth and investing in public infrastructure, the government is not only reviving industries but also promoting social welfare, ensuring that the fruits of prosperity are enjoyed by all, rather than a privileged few. The transition has been met with enthusiasm as citizens recognize the tangible benefits of a planned economy—higher employment rates, improved public services, and an overall uplift in the standard of living. This new era heralds a brighter future for Spain, one that stands as a testament to the triumph of socialist values over the instability and moral ambiguity of capitalism, paving the way for a just and equitable society."

With the PCE now firmly in control, the expansion of the UJCE is underway, designed to foster political engagement among Spain’s youth. Through a variety of educational programs, the UJCE is building a generation of well-informed young communists, equipping them with a deep understanding of Marxist theory and revolutionary history. This youth organization is seen as the pipeline for the country's future leadership and a critical support system for the military. With increased funding and state resources, the UJCE is establishing chapters in schools, workplaces, and rural areas. Political education is mandatory, blending theory with practical training in organizational skills, preparing these young Spaniards to defend the revolution and secure Spain’s socialist future. Additionally, the UJCE is expected to feed a steady stream of recruits into the armed forces. Upon coming of age, these dedicated youths will be fast-tracked into the military, ensuring a strong, ideologically aligned force. The state sees this dual role—political education and military readiness—as vital to preserving socialism in Spain for generations to come."

On the direct order of the PCE and its branches across the Republic, the decree has been heard to begin tearing down all remnants of the fascist's visage from public view, with statues destroyed, street names being hastily renamed after revolutionary heroes both modern and old, and all public symbols of the tyrant burnt or covered up. While fascists have been quick to become enraged by the erasure of their former leader, they find themselves powerless in a country now firmly dominated by the very people the villain of Spain had believed he had snuffed out. Any complaints are swiftly silenced, with local police and PCE youth chapters quickly reminding dissenters of Franco’s legacy of oppression. For many Spaniards, particularly those descended from families persecuted during Franco's reign of terror, this was a moment of long-overdue justice. For decades, the dictator's presence loomed over public spaces, a constant reminder of the brutal era that left thousands dead and countless others scarred. Now, these spaces are being transformed, with new monuments being erected to honor the victims of Francoism—those who suffered under fascist rule, those whose lives were destroyed, and those who fought against it. This symbolic reckoning is not only cleansing Spain's cities of their fascist past but also reshaping the nation’s collective memory, ensuring that future generations remember the true victims of that era."

spain.209.t:0 "Legalization of Political Parties"
spain.209.d:0 "In a landmark decision, the PCE has officially repealed the long-standing policy that restricted the establishment and expansion of political parties in Spain. This policy, which dated back to the Francoist dictatorship and was upheld by the Kingdom, had only allowed three legal parties: the People’s Party, the Socialist Workers’ Party, and the National Movement. Despite the overthrow of Felipe VI and the rise of the PCE to power, this prohibition had lingered in certain regions, where the PCE had utilized such legislation to ensure a careful swing toward the establishment of communism and the rejection of the rightist opposition. Now, the official repeal of the policy marks a significant shift in the political landscape. While there are still some limitations in place, particularly regarding reactionary or far-right movements, the formation and expansion of new political parties are now broadly permitted. The PCE has made a point of inviting other left-leaning parties to collaborate, both on the national and local levels, opening the door to a more pluralistic political environment within the framework of socialism. Expected to operate under a broad coalition of socialist and progressive forces, in keeping with the ideological line of the PCE, some question whether this repeal has altered anything. While multiple choice has been restored to the ballot, critics have been quick to point out a significant lack of choice for any deemed to the right of social democrats, with conservative movements struggling to regain a footing and gain ballot access."

This announcement marks a significant turning point in the country’s landscape, finalizing the one-party state framework that has been developing since the overthrow of King Felipe VI. Under the previous regimes- both Francoist and post-Franco monarchy- political plurality was severely restricted. The People’s Party, Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party, and National Movement were the only legal political forces. While our revolution initially seemed to suggest a shift toward broader political freedom, today’s decree has made it clear that no other organization will be allowed to challenge the Communist Party’s authority. All existing parties, including the PSOE and PP, have now been given one month to disband their operations and submit to the CPE. Failure to comply with these new directives will result in the immediate seizure of their offices and assets by the state. Party officials and members have already begun to face significant pressure, with General Secretary [ROOT.Getleader] warning that continued opposition or non-compliance will be met with severe consequences, beginning with imprisonment. However, critics- many of whom have already been silenced or are in exile- warn that this new phase of repression will only spark underground resistance and further radicalize the opposition. Despite these concerns, the General Secretary’s firm control over the state’s apparatus appears to leave little room for dissent as the country moves towards full political centralization under the PCE."

spain.211.t:0 "Rural Cooperatives Established"
spain.211.d:0 "In a decisive move to further align Spain’s agricultural sector with socialist principles, the government has introduced a new policy to subsidize farmer co-operatives. These subsidies, aimed at supporting collective ownership and operation of farms, are part of a broader effort to transition the country’s agricultural economy away from private ownership and into a new model largely adopted from Eastern European and Asian models of farming. Farmers who voluntarily agree to convert their operations into co-operatives are being offered government-subsidized contracts, providing a clear financial incentive to make the transition. These co-operatives will allow farmers to share resources, profits, and decision-making power collectively, a system the government hopes will increase efficiency, reduce rural inequality, and improve production. While the policy is framed as a voluntary initiative, critics note that the government’s strong preference for cooperative systems, coupled with the financial support available only to those who comply, may put pressure on privately-owned farms to conform. While this is entirely the idea behind the establishment of the cooperatives, the reality is that private farming has long been an unprofitable and less efficient endeavor, with the General Secretary defending this supposed punishment for private farms as a necessity to ensure funding is granted to those willing to comply with a proven and far more effective system of farming."

spain.212.t:0 "Expansion of Health Services"
spain.212.d:0 "In a long-overdue effort to address the centuries-old disparity in healthcare access between urban and rural Spain, the PCE has launched a sweeping initiative aimed at developing health services in the Republic’s most remote regions. This initiative allocates significant state funding to build and expand hospitals and clinics in rural areas, where healthcare infrastructure has historically been underdeveloped and residents have struggled to access even basic medical services. The new funding promises to bring quality, lifesaving healthcare to communities that have long been left behind, with modern facilities being established in regions that previously had little to no access to proper medical care. Mobile health units are also being deployed to ensure those in the most isolated areas can receive regular check-ups and emergency services, a transformative change for areas where healthcare was once a luxury rather than a guarantee. Critics, however, have been quick to argue that the project faces logistical challenges, particularly given the rugged terrain and lack of infrastructure in certain parts of the country, an objection that the General Secretary has taken on board, seeing this as a perfect time to also expand the infrastructure connections in these regions allowing for trains and cars carrying these essential goods to arrive quicker and bring the Republic closer together. While such projects will take time to complete, the opening steps to address these inequalities have been heralded as a major milestone for the nation, with it clear that in time, all will benefit from a system that cares not for your pocket but your health."

spain.213.t:0 "A Thriving Military Industry"
spain.213.d:0 "A significant shift aimed at revitalizing the struggling Andalusian economy has taken place today, as the government has announced substantial investments in expanding arms factories across the region. Historically one of the most impoverished and rural areas in Spain, Andalusia is now positioned to become a crucial hub for military production, bolstering the capabilities of the Red Army while simultaneously generating new employment opportunities for its residents. As production ramps up, the influx of jobs is expected to reduce employment rates significantly, providing much-needed financial stability to families who have long faced economic hardship. Moreover, the expansion of arms production facilities is likely to attract a wave of volunteers to the Red Army, many young men and women, inspired by the prospect of contributing to the defense of their newly established socialist state, are already expressing an interest in enlisting, providing them with both a sense of economic stability, but instilling them with the revolutionary values we expect of all citizens. As the PCE continues to implement policies that prioritize state control and military strength, the revitalization of Andalusia through arms manufacturing stands as a critical test of its ability to transform economic despair into strength and renewal. While the government celebrates these developments, it remains to be seen how the local population will respond to the increased militarization of their communities, especially when homelessness remains a pressing issue in the region and the long-term implications of an economy heavily reliant on arms production."

spain.214.d:0 "The liberation of women has now truly been achieved, as a historic move reflecting our long commitment to the equality of the sexes has now been completed with women now being allowed to serve in the Spanish military for the first time since the onset of the civil war in 1936. This policy shift marks a significant departure from decades of exclusion, and the government is taking measures to create a safe and supportive environment for female soldiers. While an unfortunate necessity during their integration, is to address concerns over sexual assault and harassment, women will initially be organized into separate units, ensuring that they can serve without fear of intimidation. These newly formed divisions are not merely tactical but also symbolic, as many have chosen to adopt names honoring prominent women who fought during the Spanish Civil War. Units named after courageous figures like Franny Schoonheyt and Muriel Rukeyser embody the spirit of resistance and empowerment. This initiative not only pays tribute to the legacy of women who bravely contributed to the fight against fascism but also serves to inspire a new generation of female warriors. As these units prepare to integrate into the broader military structure, the PCE is keenly aware of the potential for this development to redefine societal attitudes toward women in leadership roles. The move towards inclusivity in the armed forces reflects a broader commitment to equality, and as the military evolves, it sets a precedent for women's rights across all sectors of Spanish society."

spain.215.d:0 "With the UGT, the General Union of Labor, taking leadership over the United Left and emerging as the dominant force in Spanish politics, UGT General Secretary and President of Spain José María Álvarez Suárez has spent his first weeks in office negotiating with the country’s other unions and syndicates to bring an end to the General Strike. Despite the animosity between the UGT and the Communist Party following the UGT’s victory, the Communist Party’s syndicate, the CCOO or Workers’ Commissions, has tentatively agreed to cooperate with the new proletarian government and end their role in the strike. Even more tentative, however, are the agreements reached between Álvarez and the CNT, the National Confederation of Labor. Being the syndicate of anarchists, the CNT has been less than enthusiastic about aligning itself with state apparatuses, especially given the fraught historical relationship between the UGT and CNT. However, with Álvarez promising to empower all workers’ organizations, the CNT is willing to agree to end their part in the General Strike, at least for now. With the three major syndicates in agreement, the General Strike has ended, and the Spanish economy is once more in motion."

spain.216.d:0 "Today, President Álvarez signed into law an act mandating unionization for all members of the Spanish armed forces. The law’s fine print has also granted women the right to serve in the armed forces in all roles. By unionizing the military, the whole apparatus of the military has been democratized and geared to facilitate both meritocracy and accountability. Most military unions have also held votes among their memberships regarding joining a larger labor syndicate, which would increase their capacity to influence the government. While significant numbers of the military unions have chosen to remain independent of any broader syndicates, the majority have affiliated themselves with the UGT, whether out of ideological loyalty or the opportunities presented by joining the most powerful labor alliance in the country. The more radical syndicates, chiefly the anarchist CNT and the communist CCOO, have also won over a handful of military unions despite being largely unpopular with soldiers. This reform has overall tied the syndicates and the military closer together, fostering greater loyalty to the new regime among the common soldier. Additionally, the introduction of workplace democracy to the military has already brought about substantial changes in the hierarchy of the military, dispensing of useless bureaucrats and removing abusive officers from power."

Today, this ends. Over the last few weeks, syndicates across the country have called on their military unions to go on strike, refusing to return to active service until reactionaries have been removed from leadership roles. So far, it appears to be effective, with known reactionaries across the country being dislodged from power. These generals have been sent into retirement, and graciously provided with a suite of retirement benefits, even if many are frustrated to see such reactionaries granted such luxury. Nevertheless, the strike has now concluded, at long last fully depoliticizing our army and freeing it of centuries of bureaucratic bloat. Finally, Spain’s military can be regarded as a modern institution, on par with the other powers of Europe."

The new program organizes the creation of new “community defense units,” which exist to serve as local police and as military-ready militias as needed. The goal, therefore, is to both strengthen the armed forces and provide a check on the authority of more traditional police departments. Participation in these community defense units requires that one lives in the region that they would be policing in and that they have been living in that area for several years. Participation is purely voluntary and is intended to be secondary to a person’s primary job, but participation carries with it several special benefits. All community defense units are represented by the Community Defense Syndicate, which exists to ensure that all government offices leading the community defense units are being held to the expected standards. To prevent the police and military institutions from gaining too much government influence, however, the Community Defense Syndicate is not allowed to stand in Intersyndical elections and thus cannot hold seats in parliament."

Today, in honor of their valiance in helping the working class fight against fascism, the government has decided to make exceptions to this rule for the leaders of the Communist Party and the Socialist Workers’ Party. Provided that they file out the proper paperwork and are supported by their unions, officials from these two parties are now permitted to obtain union and government offices. While this is largely seen as an effective way of drawing on the wealth of knowledge and experience held by these party members, some critics believe that this will ultimately bring about the return of bourgeois liberalism.

Drawing inspiration from the efforts of the CNT during the Spanish Civil War, the government has now begun laying the groundwork for a future where traditional currency holds little sway over the daily lives of workers. Through the formation of the Intersyndical Alliance, unions are now tasked with the responsibility of supplying basic goods directly to their members, effectively positioning them as the primary providers of essential services. This initiative not only reinforces the power of organized labor but also alleviates the dependency on a currency-driven economy, allowing workers to focus on their needs rather than financial concerns. By distributing necessities such as food, healthcare, and education, the unions are fostering a communal spirit that prioritizes solidarity over profit. While the complete abolition of money remains a long-term goal fraught with challenges, this innovative approach signifies a significant shift in societal priorities. As money becomes increasingly relegated to the acquisition of luxury items, workers are liberated from the constraints of a capitalist marketplace, heralding a new era where the needs of the collective are met through mutual aid and cooperation. While it may take time to convince everyone of the benefits of this new system, especially as workers remain confused about the entire process, our efforts will no doubt soon educate all on the benefits of such a system."

With a renewed commitment to tackling misogyny and homophobia, the administration has enshrined equal rights for women and recognized the rights of sexual minorities, promising full protections under the law. This has meant that from now on homosexual relations and marriages are fully legal and recognized by the government, who have mandated that all churches issue marriage licenses regardless of the genders or sexual orientations of the couples. Similarly, though more controversial for the time being, transgender individuals can now live more openly, with enhanced rights that ensure access to essential medical facilities and services tailored to their needs. These progressive changes have sparked outrage among hardcore Catholics and conservative factions, who view them as a threat to traditional values. However, the overwhelming sentiment among the Spanish populace reflects support for these advancements, celebrating a new era of acceptance and human rights. With an internal war waging against those who oppose this progress, it is clear that bigotry has overstayed its welcome in the Republic with the government not hesitating to eradicate all who would speak out against their comrades for merely looking, acting, or dressing differently."

This significant reform arises from the collaborative efforts within the Intersyndical Alliance, where even Catholic members, such as those from the Catholic Socialist Syndicate, have recognized the necessity of a secular state for the collective good. Under this new framework, the government has mandated that all educational matters be managed by the syndicates, thus placing the future of Spanish youth firmly in the hands of workers' organizations rather than religious authorities. While church officials will be treated with the same care as those employed by syndicates, their activities will now fall under the oversight of local branches of the Community Defense Syndicate, ensuring accountability and transparency in their operations. Importantly, priests and nuns will not be permitted to join unions, reinforcing the principle that religious figures should remain separate from labor movements. With the backing of the Catholic syndicates, this transformation has been made significantly easier, however, the fact of the matter remains- secularization in a country that has historically been Catholic will prove difficult despite our reforms with many anticipating a long conflict to fully implement the new system."

Despite condemnation from the Communist Party, which has long sat on the sidelines as we have constructed socialism in the image that was intended by Marx, the workers have made it clear who they have supported throughout our endeavor, with the utopian dream now a reality across the Republic. While surprising to our foes, it has been unsurprising to us that when the government places the plight of the worker and recognizes the diversity of its unions, cooperation across all industries skyrockets.

The campaign, under the banner "Live Simply, Share Abundantly," emphasizes the idea that the pursuit of luxury is not only impractical but also detracts from the collective goals of society. Public service announcements and community workshops will highlight the benefits of sustainable living, encouraging citizens to embrace cooperative production and prioritize community needs over personal desires. As unions continue to evolve, providing for the basic needs of their members without the constraints of currency, this campaign aims to foster a mindset that values practicality over superficiality. The government argues that shifting away from luxury consumerism will not only alleviate economic pressures on unions but also cultivate a sense of solidarity and shared purpose among the populace.

This new structure has been a long-standing priority of the Galician People’s Union, a communist association with significant nationalist influence, whose militants now seek to join the ranks of the Spanish military. The UPG, once branded as a terrorist organization by the Francoist regime, has now pivoted towards the ideals of our federal and socialist system. While their expertise in guerrilla tactics and local knowledge could be valuable assets to the military, the prospect of integrating former UPG militants into the armed forces raises concerns. Nationally, it could alienate non-Galician communities and create perceptions of favoritism, as well as stir unease among more conservative factions within the military, who have rightly called out their terroristic actions over the past decade and longer. However, at a time when the armed forces are already undergoing rapid transformations and cuts, there can surely be no harm in expanding our numbers with a group of militias who have proven themselves in combat against fascism. While they may never again see frontline action, with many seeing that they should be forced to maintain a purely defensive role, their entry would send a clear message that Spain is united and that fascism has been eradicated from our borders."

In Galicia, however, the Galician Unions Confederacy, or CIG, has sparked some controversy. The CIG is the syndicate that has historically been tied to the Galician nationalist left, particularly the Galician People’s Union, a Galician nationalist and communist political party. The CIG is currently the single biggest syndicate in Galicia, representing nearly 40% of workers in the region. In the process of forming its militias, the CIG created several militias composed of militants who had fought against the dictatorships of Franco and Juan Carlos. Despite the overwhelming support the population has shown for the end of the dictatorships, the Galician nationalist militants have remained controversial due to their history of separatism and their reputation for getting civilians caught in the crossfire during their skirmishes with the Civil Guard during the decades of dictatorship. Legally speaking, we can do little to prevent them from joining the military, as our new laws have exonerated all people labeled as terrorists for fighting against the dictatorships and because we lack substantive evidence to convict any of these militia members for playing a role in civilian casualties. As such, despite sparking a minor controversy, the Galician militants are going to be joining our military and officer corps."

Whilst the request is tempting, with many viewing it as an opportunity to bolster the armed forces and present the Spanish army as one built of peoples from all across the Republic, the likelihood that these guerillas have relations to the Galician People’s Union has concerned some. Though the representatives have now renounced their violent ways, believing the establishment of an equal federation to be akin to their goals of self-determination, the fact remains that the GPU was involved in multiple terrorist attacks during the twentieth century. Though these actions can be viewed as a heroic struggle against fascism, their integration would prove controversial and run the risk of reigniting tensions that have only recently been resolved. Instead, some have argued that the Prime Minister offers these remnants an official pardon, however, if we are to overcome Francoism we must challenge its lingering legitimacy regardless of the consequences."

The new legislation legalizes independent trade unions, granting workers the freedom to organize outside of the once-dominant Sindicato Vertical, the state-controlled labor syndicate that had long served as a tool for suppressing worker dissent and ensuring loyalty to the regime. Through the abolition of the SV, the government has now marked a decisive break from the autocratic labor policies that persisted throughout the decades of oppression at the hands of the fascist and royal dictatorships. One of the most significant provisions of the reform is the exoneration of trade unionists who were arrested during the days of the regimes, erasing the legal stains on countless individuals who had fought for workers’ rights in an era of repression. As a result of this sweeping reform, the thousands of strikers who lined the streets previously have now begun to return to work, seeing that the state has now recognized the need for drastic reform. However, not all are satisfied. Various communist and radical socialist organizations have denounced the measures and are only finishing half of the job, demanding further comprehensive changes that go beyond the legalization of independent trade unions, such as wealth distribution and the dismantling of corporate power structures. While Prime Minister [ROOT.Getleader] has eased much of the unrest on the streets, the path toward complete labor harmony is far from certain, with the current hope being that the communists tire themselves out and return to work once their coffers begin to dry up."

Though the trade unionists had hoped that any legislation would have built upon previous work, perhaps even empowering their movements and granting them further representation, this was not to be with many remaining protestors stating the coalition has done nothing more than appease their bourgeoisie backers. However, despite this lackluster reform, many strikers have accepted that the recent surge in support for the Popular Union within the government would temper any chance for real reform with many returning to work at least grateful that a living wage will be guaranteed to them.

To ensure that a stable relationship can be established between the workers and corporate officials, the Act has now brought an end to direct union-busting enshrining workers' rights to organize and oppose their employers. Alongside this, unions have been granted the power to walk out whenever they desire without notifying the government or their employers. Though these rights have outraged many companies, as well as the Royalist Coalition, most have been reluctant to voice their concerns as most have been hoping for a quick end to the now-faltering general strike. With these rights enshrined, a decision has now been taken by the unions to return to work with those participating pleased that the government has taken their side on this delicate matter even if many were hoping for more extensive reforms believing that the unions should play an extensive role within the republic in order to solidify the new era of Spanish socialism and avoid a return to the Francoist economic laws entirely."

With this act, thirty new parliamentary seats have been established each of them to be held by the leaders and representatives of Spain’s unions who are to be treated like all other members of parliament and allowed to scrutinize and work with the government to enshrine new legislation. Though many across the nation have heralded this as a triumph for the working class, despite some more radical elements desiring further reform, the strike has now been ordered to end with the unions satisfied that their rights will be protected by their own.

Though a tame solution, with many within the PSOE demanding the legislation be taken further and the nobility either taxed or removed entirely, parliament now has the Political Restrictions Act which strips the nobility of their long-held right to engage in politics and the political implications of their titles. Though a minor alteration, with the Prime Minister stating that this legislation does not repeal the existence of the nobility, radical elements within the Royalist Coalition and across the far-right have insisted that such an attack on tradition is an abandonment of all that Spain has stood for over the last few centuries. Disregarding their allies’ statements, most of the Royalist Coalition is appreciative of the restraint the Prime Minister has displayed in allowing the nobility to remain believing their actions are demonstrative of their desire to work together during the early days of this new Republic."

Alongside this, to ensure the nobility remain engaged with the society they are supposed to represent internationally public funding has been halted with all members of the nobility expected to utilize their unused properties to create new opportunities for employment for all Spanish citizens. As expected, many within the Royalist Coalition have protested this legislation arguing that it is not right for the nobility to be treated this way due to the long-standing traditions that Spain has fought to uphold for centuries. Despite this protestation, with the many within the PSOE demanding the act go further, many are relieved that the nobility is no longer in a position to do harm to the Republic and that equality continues to triumph over division."

Despite this, the government has ignored these threats believing that the Popular Union’s threats are empty and that their current participation in government has hindered the possibility of a mass defection to the Royalist Coalition. With conservatives decrying this as a deliberate attack on traditional values, believing this is merely a stepping stone towards the implementation of more communist values, there are even some allied to the radical PSOE who believe that this act may have been a step too far too quickly. Regardless of the conservative backlash to act, the establishment of equality continues to be supported by the vast majority of the populace with many finding humor in the fact that now the nobles who sneered down on them will have to join them in everyday jobs now that their public funding has been cut off."

As expected, there has been little resistance to the implementation of these new rights with even the fringe of the Royalist Coalition accepting the expansion of voting rights was necessary to ensure a fair and functioning democracy. However, this has not stopped select members of parliament from attempting to argue against the freedom granted to women and that the voting age is much too low.

These articles have now been rescinded establishing Spain as a secular state where the role of the Catholic church has been diminished. Though hard-line conservatives across the nation are naturally outraged with the decision, believing that the coalition had no right to impose such a dramatic change that will affect less than five percent of the population, the vast majority of the Royalist Coalition has accepted why the Prime Minister has passed such an act with Mariano Rajoy praising the act for retaining tax breaks for the Church. With politics now no longer an affair that the Church can get involved in, it is hoped that the state of the nation will begin to reflect the desires of the elected government, ending centuries of domination and finally allowing the people freedom from the oppressive hold of the Catholic Church on nearly all elements of society."

However, whilst the act has allowed for the establishment of autonomous communities the Prime Minister has ensured the Royalist Coalition members that Spain will remain a unitary state despite the heavy degree of autonomy being granted to the various regions currently inflicted the continued rise of separatist woes. Thankfully, the act will put an end to this continued rise as regions across the nation are now allowed to effectively govern themselves so long as they do not seek to pass sweeping reforms that would damage the unity of the nation, such as independence referenda.

With nationalists decrying the act as an affront to the unity and safety of the Spanish state, with many claiming that by the year's end Spain will cease to exist, the vast majority of people have respected the act as a natural conclusion to dealing with the separatist issues that have plagued Spain for decades. Whilst the act has dealt with the issues caused by the centralization of the state, now allowing for the linguistic and national divides in our nation to be settled, there are some who still feel that the act has not gone far enough believing that the only true solution to the matter of separatism is the establishment of a confederal system.

Going further the reform package has also dealt with the issues of nepotism and has forcefully demoted several unjustly promoted figures replacing them with well-regarded officers who have long been denied a promotion simply due to their lack of relations with those in government. Despite these issues being widely supported by all members of government, the Royalist Coalition has taken issue with one amendment within the act which has allowed women to serve in military command roles.

Their decision to accept this deal has come with some skepticism from select members of parliament, believing the act has granted these officials something in return. However, with the budget cut effectively targeting the worst excesses of the military, it seems unlikely the Royalists have gained something out of this. Thankfully, with this moderate approach to reform leaving the payroll of the military alone, the risk of the continued rise in politicization of the armed forces has largely been negated as the old guard of the military is pleased to retain their positions and serve the new state with few complaints.

Although this has opened the doors to the modernization of the armed forces, with several previously held-back officers now receiving promotions to fill the gaps left by the retiring officers, there has been significant backlash to this forced retirement with many in opposition questioning if this purge is legitimate. Stating that it is a democratic right to hold an opinion, even a controversial one, the Royalist Coalition has claimed this wave of retirements to be completely illegitimate, demanding that the generals be allowed to remain in their place.

Already the effectiveness of the Republican Home Guard has been demonstrated to the government, as over two hundred soldiers and several generals have been court-martialed for their support of Francoism greatly improving morale within the army. Though this expansion has been widely praised by left-wing members of the government, representatives of the Popular Union and Royalist Coalition have decried this as nothing more than a witch hunt with the extreme right of the opposition claiming this is nothing more than a politicization of the military in a different light, arguing that the government would have made Stalin proud with their ruthless persecution of those with a different political opinion.

The worst of such instances happened outside of the Madrid train station, in which over two hundred socialists have now been arrested for their vile assault on workers and the police. With an increased police presence, these workers have now been able to restart rail and bus routes allowing the very same “scabs” to begin traveling across the nation restarting industries that have been crippled by the actions of the selfish left.

While hardliners within the government have lambasted the move as a costly and short-sighted solution, it has been viewed as one of perhaps the only practical ways to break the deadlock and bring the strike to a swift conclusion. The financial incentive, though continuously decried as irresponsible, has proven effective in swaying workers back to their jobs. For many strikers, faced with dwindling funds and a weakening movement, the prospect of a bonus offers immediate relief and brings forth the idea that their illegal unions were all bark yet no bite delegitimizing the movement in the future. With the bonuses rolling out, the strike, which once paralyzed the nation, has begun to crumble. The leftist syndicates that called for the strike have now found their ranks increasingly thinned, their ability to negotiate eroding as more workers abandon their lines each day.

While the strike has officially been quelled, the scars of the operation are inescapable. The clashes between soldiers and strikers left many dead or wounded, further intensifying the bitterness between the state and workers, countless jobs that once belonged to these strikers have also been taken over by scabs, which has done little to abate the growing unemployment crisis.

However, with the dust now settling and the nation seeking stability, this discussion has largely dissipated, with the staunchest critics of Felipe within the military even toning down their rhetoric against him. Having initially refused to empower any monarch, the Right Coalition has now opted to restore the Kingdom under a constitutional monarch, returning Felipe and his family to the throne and securing his bloodline as the legitimate successors to the throne. While most political factions had expected this outcome, seeing it as the only reasonable course of action to avoid further factionalism developing, the Carlist forces that have lobbied ministers during this period are notably displeased. Having hoped that the chaos in Spain would have been their pathway to restore their long-aspired claims to the throne, such hopes have once again been diminished, with the Carlists now likely to become nothing more than a footnote in history once again.

Keeping with these reforms, her oldest child will then inherit the throne thereafter, establishing a clear and uninterrupted line of succession for the Kingdom. While this decision is largely symbolic, the decision represents a crucial step in preventing future disputes over royal legitimacy, particularly those reminiscent of the Carlist conflicts that once plagued Spain.

This restructuring not only clears out the bureaucratic dead weight that has festered within the military since before the turn of the millennium but also allows for the long-awaited promotion of junior officers who had been stuck in career limbo, reinvigorating the ranks with new leadership. Likewise, efforts have been made to consolidate several military offices in the hopes of streamlining the effectiveness of administrative tasks, which has already proven successful. The military’s chain of command has as a result become more efficient, with less redundancy and faster decision-making being observed across all branches. These changes have been praised by defense analysts, who have argued that the modernization efforts will result in a far leaner, more effective fighting force.

At the heart of these talks is a mutual agreement with the Prime Minister demanding that the military pledge an end to the era of pronunciamientos, and in exchange, the government will commit to preserving the territorial integrity of Spain as defined by the armed forces and to aggressively combat the remnants of leftist extremism within the bounds of legality. Seemingly pleased with their newfound ability to define the borders of the Kingdom, the military high command has now accepted this deal, promising to never again utilize its power to usurp the government so long as Prime Minister [ROOT.Getleader] maintain their end of the bargain. This unprecedented agreement marks a decisive moment for both the military and the state, as the armed forces now have taken a much-needed step back from the political arena, allowing them to focus their efforts on modernization rather than petty politics. For many, this accord signals the end of the dual control of power within the Cortes, however, despite its more than favorable terms, some remain worried surrounding the vagueness of the agreement, particularly the military’s power to define the territorial borders of Spain."

spain.263.t:0 "The Military Modernization Act"
spain.263.d:0 "Perhaps expectedly, the Spanish military finds itself at a crossroads where it has been caught between a turbulent relationship with King Felipe VI and their staunch opposition to leftist movements. With no clear political allies and the growing realization that a military coup would be a short-lived unmitigated disaster, the armed forces have been left with little choice but to align with [ROOT.Getleader]’s government. While the military may grumble in private, it is clear that leveraging the situation has allowed the government to push through much-needed reforms, modernizing and streamlining the military’s operations. As a result of these reforms, the political landscape has been allowed to shift, and even those parties traditionally aligned with the military have shown a willingness to prioritize their agenda over the armed forces’ interests. Having sat back and allowed the Military Modernization Act to pass, this forced modernization is, paradoxically, making the military far more professional and less politicized, stripping it of its right to oversee and engage with lobbying efforts within the Cortes. With the armed forces stripped of their previous access to government, a harsh reality has now descended across the high command who now have seen the folly of their ways promising to redivert their efforts towards the total and complete reorganization of their training, recruitment, and spending practices."

spain.264.t:0 "Executive Powers Delegated to King"
spain.264.d:0 "To consolidate the power held by the Spanish monarchy, the People’s Party has today passed a constitutional amendment to make Felipe the second most influential individual within the political system. Under the new legislation, not only does Felipe VI possess consideration authority over the creation and ratification of legislation, but his involvement in state matters now extends beyond the traditional ceremonial role of the monarch. One of the powers entrusted to the King under the new constitutional amendments is the duty to swear in newly elected governments. However, Felipe’s expanded influence has meant that his role is no longer purely ceremonial in effect the King will now function as a second prime minister. Critics have been quick to attack this amendment as an assault on democracy, with former Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, expressing immediate concerns over the implications of these changes, which have now nearly brought an end to the coalition between One Spain and the People’s Party. To add to the controversy, the new amendment also introduces a curious contradiction. While the King is responsible for certifying new elections, the same constitution also mandates that any government winning an election must be sworn in, establishing a legal gray area over what might occur if the King refuses to swear in a new government. While aiming to restore traditionalist authority across the Kingdom, it seems the only thing the People’s Party has accomplished with this amendment is ensuring that one day in the future conflict may emerge between the second prime minister and his government."

spain.265.t:0 "State Catholicism Reaffirmed"
spain.265.d:0 "The official re-commitment to Catholicism as the state religion has signaled a return to the deeply entrenched clerical influence over key aspects of public life, ranging from politics, education, and the economy. In this newly entrenched religious paradigm, the Catholic Church is not merely an advisory body but an architect of national policy, allowing State Catholicism to be maintained and ensuring that the National Catholicism birthed by the symbiotic relationship between Franco and the Church is allowed to survive into the modern day. While such a decision has been supported by the Cortes, the Prime Minister has been criticized by some minority movements, largely from Jewish and Muslim communities, who have claimed that they and their faith are being cast aside as if they simply did not exist. With their institutions remaining vulnerable and exposed, it seems as though this policy will ultimately lead to the dissolution of synagogues and mosques across the Kingdom seeing as the government now refuses to grant them the desired protections and tax exemptions they desperately have sought to secure. While a dramatic setback for some, the Catholic Church has now met with the Prime Minister to endorse their government completely, hoping that the alliance between Church and state can continue uninterrupted for another century. As the system begun by Franco now begins anew, the stability of the nation has all but been secured, only at the cost of the thousands of minorities who now fear both persecution and the complete loss of the culture."

spain.266.t:0 "Formation of Coalitions"
spain.266.d:0 "With the recent call for a general election heard across the nation by acting Prime Minister Iglesias, the political landscape has appeared to have made quite a shift today as two new powerful coalitions were formed in preparation for the elections in two weeks time. Though parties had originally intended to stand individually, the rise in instability has now forced both the left and right wings of Spanish politics to band together in the hopes of maintaining a peaceful transition toward democracy. With the Coalition for Progress pushing for the continued march toward the values of the Second Republic its members, the PSOE and Popular Union, have faced an increasingly hostile reaction from their opponents. Branding them as nothing more than a Leftist or Republican Coalition the right-wing Coalition for Reform, consisting of the People’s Party and One Spain, has instead argued that their opponents have rejected the need for stability and argue that the imposition of a Third Republic will lead to further destabilization. Refuting these claims, and retorting by branding their opponents as nothing more than a Royalist Coalition, the stage has now been set for perhaps the most important election since 1936 with the fate of the nation resting in the hands of either the Left or Right Coalition."

spain.267.t:0 "Universal Suffrage Guaranteed"
spain.267.d:0 "In a dramatic shift from the historically limited voting rights of the Francoist era and Juan Carlos’ rule, the Cortes officially expanded suffrage to all citizens over the age of eighteen regardless of their race, gender, faith, or socioeconomic status. Previously, under Franco and King Juan Carlos, while elections had existed and were permitted by both heads of state, the offices in question held very little real power, and voting rights were structured in a way that disadvantaged women and the poor. This sudden and dramatic reversal has established a clear electoral framework that represents a monumental break from the past, as the government now moves to eliminate the exclusions that long disenfranchised marginalized groups. While the reform is being hailed as a definitive step towards the establishment of a modern Kingdom, this progressive move has brought forward questions about how deeply the expansion of rights will affect the entrenched power structures. While the legal framework now provides for great inclusivity, the political culture in Spain is still deeply rooted in its recent autocratic past, meaning that the expansion of the franchise will either see this autocracy remain entrenched with political parties continuing to act in their best interests, or the sudden surge in the voter base will force through radical and untested change onto a Kingdom perhaps unready for it. Regardless of how the new franchise elects to utilize their rights, one thing is certain Spain has forever changed with it now impossible to return to how it once was."
spain.267.o1:0 "Modernization is here to stay"

spain.268.t:0 "Francoist Voting Rights Reformed"
spain.268.d:0 "In a nod to Spain’s complicated political history, the government has opted to ensure the survival of the Francoist era voting laws, making minor alterations to avoid the sudden imposition of a franchise that would be ungrateful for, or incapable to best utilize, their ballot. The new laws have lowered the voting age from twenty-three to eighteen, hoping to attract a sizable number of politically engaged youth to enter the world of politics and have their voices heard. However, despite this expansion other requirements have remained in place. To vote, citizens must still be Catholic, economically self-sufficient, married, or living alone. While the local government was once able to enforce laws that limit the number of women who can legally live together in a household without a male presence, effectively barring large swathes of the population from exercising their voting rights, such powers have also now been rescinded. Instead, the law now stipulates that people living with roommates, provided they were not related, would be allowed to vote, allowing the poor and women to find alternative settlements due to their lack of marital status or economic self-sufficiency. However, given the current economic landscape - which continues to be characterized by low wages and high unemployment, especially among women - the practical impact of these reforms will likely be minimal. While a clear step towards modernization has begun, the restrictions kept in place have ensured that the days of Franco still linger over the Kingdom, for better or worse."

spain.269.t:0 "Nobility Rights Reinforced"
spain.269.d:0 "Despite its internal divisions, the coalition government has reached a firm consensus on one key issue: the preservation of the Spanish nobility. In a move that solidifies their symbolic and material status, the coalition has committed to enshrining their privileges in the new constitution. Nobles, along with their families, will retain their ancestral estates, exempt entirely from taxation while continuing to receive state support funded by taxpayer money. For many within the coalition - composed of nationalist, monarchist, conservative, and Christian democratic factions - the nobility represents the bedrock of Spain’s identity and traditional values. Ensuring their constitutional protection is seen not only as safeguarding Spain’s heritage but also as a hierarchical social order that reinforces conservative principles. While the Cortes is unified in its decision, critics, however, have been quick to argue that this move only cements a system of entrenched privilege at a time when inequality remains a pressing issue for Spain, questioning what message this sends to the public. However, such criticism has fallen on deaf ears with many merely accepting this as the natural order, with only the most radical of leftists that persist within society demanding the removal of this amendment. With the rights of the nobility upheld and the values of old now enshrined for centuries to come, the government can now move on to more pressing matters, with the public eager for debate to end on trivial matters and the economic woes affecting the Kingdom finally be sorted."

spain.270.t:0 "Royal Frugality Measures"
spain.270.d:0 "Long criticized for the vast sums of taxpayer money it has absorbed throughout the past few centuries, the Spanish royal family is now taking its first steps towards fiscal restraint. Historically, while much of Spain’s tax revenue has been allocated to state operations, a significant excess has been diverted to fund the household’s luxurious lifestyle, including extravagant parties and lavish dinners. However, King Felipe VI has initiated a shift in policy, embracing measures of frugality and cutting back on these ostentatious expenditures. By reducing the share of tax money funneled into royal coffers, Felipe aims to free up resources for the state to use in national development projects. This decision marks a break from the royal family’s traditionally opulent reputation and signals an acknowledgement of the economic challenges facing the country. While many monarchists view this as a prudent move, some critics remain skeptical, seeing the cuts as a symbolic gesture rather than a meaningful reform of the monarchy’s financial entitlements. For the government, this reallocation of funds opens new possibilities for investment in infrastructure, public services, and development initiatives, as the state regains control over a larger portion of its revenue."

Although the sheer number of major strikes initially made it difficult for state agents to intervene, our intelligence efforts have chipped away at the solidarity holding these movements together. With strike leaders fragmenting due to our recent espionage initiatives, it become easier to gather intel, track them to their safehouses, and execute targeted arrests. In a coordinated series of raids, agents apprehended a significant number of strike leaders, uncovering lists of confidants and other key figures behind the general strike. This decisive action has severely weakened the strikes, leaving the remaining movements disorganized and largely ineffective. With the leadership in disarray, employers and police forces have swiftly moved to restore order, ensuring that factories, farms, and other sectors can resume operations. As the strike crumbles, the economy has begun to regain its footing, with minimal resistance left to challenge the restoration of business as usual. While critics have decreased the state’s heavy-handed approach, with lingering elements of communist resistance decrying this as a prime example of the fascistic nature of the Kingdom, officials have largely argued that these actions were necessary to break the deadlock and restore economic stability."

Spain will remain a Catholic nation, there has been no question nor debate on the matter, and the church will maintain its influential position across various sectors. However, Felipe has made it abundantly clear that any religious officials involved in these spheres must demonstrate unwavering loyalty to the monarchy. This decision is in direct response to historical tensions, particularly the notorious Opus Dei faction’s maneuvers during Franco’s rule, which were seen by many as a quasi-coup against his authority, undermining his and later Juan Carlos’ rule. By ensuring that Church officials are firmly aligned with the crown, Felipe aims to neutralize the possibility of religious factions challenging royal authority, with the message clear: wield your influence, but serve the crown. While this reform has been well received, critics have feared that this only further serves to entwine the church and state at the cost of pluralism and democracy. However, for most royalist and traditionalist wings of the government, this decree has been viewed as a necessary safeguard to ensure national unity and prevent future internal divisions from once again destabilizing the Kingdom."

The decision, framed as a necessary response to their age and political entanglements, serves as a clear message to those seeking to or are involved in political plots within the armed forces- cease your meddling and allow for the military to act as an apolitical defender of the Kingdom. From now on, officers must choose between a career in the armed forces or political involvement, with any being found to be involved in both stripped of their ranks and dismissed just as Bucher and Calderón were. This move forms part of a broader restructuring effort within the Spanish military, as new regulations governing the conduct of military officials have been implemented to ensure that the armed forces remain apolitical and cannot be swayed nor tempted by representatives within the Cortes or seek to influence the Cortes in any matter. While Bucher and Calderón have been more than vocal about their forced retirement, ushering in contempt for the King from many of their allies, the fact of the matter remains true that this move has been a successful one, with the military’s focus gradually shifting from petty office politics and the salvation of traditionalism to the defense of the Kingdom and the crown."

These academies will offer free tuition to students who achieve high enough marks during their secondary and further education schooling, aiming to foster a new generation of intellectuals who will contribute to the development and modernization of the Kingdom. The plan has been hailed by its supporters, mostly students and parents, as a bold step toward reviving Spain’s educational prowess and laying the foundation for a golden age of innovation. However, this educational renaissance is not without its critics. Those closest to the King have been wary of the potential consequences of such broad access to education, especially in light of recent student-led unrest and their growing radicalization. The political climate among Spain’s youth has become increasingly volatile, with students often at the forefront of progressive and, in some cases, republican movements. As a result, the very institutions intended to promote academic and economic growth funded by the crown could, ironically, become breeding grounds for anti-monarchist sentiment. Taking on board these worries, the Royal Science Academies have now amended their entry requirements, disallowing any individual previously involved in Marxist and republican movements, and have even prohibited all political activism from taking place on their campuses."

Beginning with this appointment, each year the King will personally attend the lottery event to announce the newest member of the Spanish nobility which, while not granting the winning family any land, does provide various political and economic privileges, such as the ability to claim a small portion of the royal families income provided it is utilized for the betterment of the victors family or local community. Despite early suspicions that the lottery would have been rigged to benefit the King’s political allies, with citizens believing it to be a way to expand the nobility without having to involve the so-called peasants of the Kingdom, the results of the inaugural draw have dispelled these concerns. The first recipients of this honorary status were Mr and Mrs. Vilches from the small town of Santa Elena, who have now become the Count and Countess of their town. Having met with the King following their victory, the couple has promised to utilize their newfound title for not themselves, though jested that their attic did need renovating, but for the public good of Santa Elena, promising to donate their earnings to the public library and local Church. While some have continued to view the lottery as a populist gesture to continue to build goodwill for the monarchy, the sudden victory by a random commoner has now sparked keen interest in the lottery, with a majority viewing it as a charitable gamble for the betterment of all Spain."

While this may have backfired at the moment, with regional terrorist cells still maintaining an incredible struggle against Madrid, their implementation has now been agreed to have been a necessary endeavor by even the staunchest of unionists in government. To ensure these measures are enforced, the military and the civil guard have been deployed across key regions to suppress any potential uprisings and demonstrations that may emerge as a result of this royal decree. Likewise, the eyes of the Centro Nacional de Inteligencia have been closely observing the remnants of separatist movements, to monitor their every move and avoid the instigation of any further uprisings. However, with these movements largely beheaded and their leadership either arrested or in hiding, it is not expected they will be an issue. This centralized approach, while welcomed by most within the Cortes, has raised concerns about the long-term stability of the Kingdom. Where protests were able to arise, it has become apparent that the movement for autonomy is slowly shifting its messaging to become more appealing. Gone are the calls for independence, replaced by the demands for the decree to be immediately repealed and elements of autonomy once more granted to the areas affected. Such a tactical rebranding has concerned the King, who has been eager to avoid a second U-turn on this matter."

While the King has cracked down on political radicals such as Opus Dei and others who might undermine the monarch’s authority, he has recognized that competent experts are essential for resolving the Kingdom’s continuing economic challenges. As a result, specialized economic societies have been established, each focusing on particular sectors such as agriculture, industry, and finance. These societies are composed of foreign-educated individuals, influential business owners, and members of Spain's aristocracy, ensuring a combination of traditional and modern perspectives. Serving as advisory bodies to both the King and the Cortes, these experts will seek to grant counsel on how best to guide the nation’s economy. As a much softer version of technocracy, this model has already shown signs of improving the economy, as a clearer strategic input on issues such as industry revitalization, modernization of agriculture, and managing fiscal policy has now been developed. However, despite the obvious benefits, critics of the plan have argued that the model disproportionately aids and assists the growth of the middle and upper classes, leaving the working class to suffer as they have done for over a century."

While concerns of the grant system being a financial trap for those willing to speculate on the currently growing market, the program has seen internal and international trade networks see a significant boom with individuals across the Kingdom providing a fresh perspective on business strategy as suddenly thousands are lifted out of unemployment and many more from poverty.

With the arts and sciences flourishing after decades of stagnation, a cultural renaissance is underway as artists, writers, and intellectuals are once again finding their voices, contributing to a vibrant public discourse that had long been suppressed. While opposition to the King persists- particularly from factions for more traditional republican governance- Felipe’s broad appeal and the newfound optimism among the populace have helped consolidate his position and sway any vestiges of moderates who may have been inclined to support a republican movement. Under Felipe’s leadership, Spain is not just navigating the complexities of modern governance but is also reestablishing its identity with a rich cultural heritage and promising a future where all, no matter their economic background, can find a way to become involved in their nation’s development with it possible that, unless a drastic reversal of recent reforms occurs, the House of Bourbon will rule uncontested for the foreseeable future."

This progressive move reflects an evolving societal attitude, with the military now opening its doors to sexual minorities, marking a significant step forward in combating discrimination within the armed forces and the nation’s various social programs. However, while these reforms represent a substantial advancement in sexual minority rights, challenges are likely to remain. Many have argued such legislation has been forced through the Cortes and that the King has abused his position to undermine the church’s position on the sanctity of marriage. However, the specifics of the new rights have been significantly reduced to avoid disputes between the King and church, with the latter still permitted to refer sexual minority youth to conversion therapy camps, convents, and monasteries, where they will be, hopefully, converted away from their sinful lifestyle. Yet those who are not referred or are deemed adults in the eyes of the state will be permitted to live a life more accepting of their lifestyle. Despite the ongoing issues between King and the church, the general atmosphere in Spain is beginning to shift in favor of sexual minorities, with thirty-six percent believing there should be no difference in treatment between a straight or gay individual in society, up from the previous eleven percent. While the path toward full equality may still be long, these recent developments signal a positive momentum for the fight for sexual minorities across the Kingdom."

While the introduction of state-funded public hospitals represents a step forward, critics argue that the efforts fall short of addressing the systemic issues within the healthcare landscape, arguing that if it can be done in certain regions, why can this not be expanded across the Kingdom and grant free healthcare to all. Many rural communities still lack access to these facilities, leaving significant gaps in coverage for those who need it most, as most new hospitals have been constructed in major cities. Yet, supporters of the initiative, however, have emphasized that establishing any public healthcare infrastructure is a positive development, particularly in a system that has been dominated by private entities for decades. With it clear that the establishment of these hospitals has renewed a debate on the passage of a national healthcare service similar to that of the British NHS, progress is continuing to sweep across the Kingdom even if the steps taken continue to be limited and only serve to strengthen the urban classes dominance and the King’s popularity."

This initiative not only aims to instill a sense of duty and patriotism in the younger generation but also provides a clear pathway into the military for those who complete their training. Upon reaching adulthood, these young recruits will have the opportunity to join the military with guaranteed wages that surpass those of typical enlistees, offering a clear attractive incentive for participation from a young age. However, this program does come with a significant caveat: those who enlist in the paramilitary branch will be subject to potential conscription in times of national crisis. As a result of this stipulation, significant controversy has arisen, with critics and supporters alike concerned that this will result in the armed forces utilizing child soldiers should conflict ever occur.

Though less popular across mainland Spain, with many towns merely copying the laws of the capital, the King has recognized that support for the Carlist movements has historically come from the minority regions of Spain who were inspired by our devotion to autonomy successfully curtailing their popularity once the announcement of the fueros’ restoration was made. Though our opponents have decried this as a return to the dark ages, the establishment of a second level of government has demonstrated to all that the tyranny of the crown has at last ended and that under Carlism, the Spanish people shall always be free to decide their own laws."

However, as is expected with radicals, it is unclear whether this has been the killing blow needed to end the strike action with the King ordering that the police maintain their presence across the vital sectors of the economy and wait to see if the radicals have given up or are merely biding their time to strike once again."

These efforts have included the customary demonization of the Second Republic, along with derisive portrayals of the short-lived and perpetually deadlocked First Republic. Drawing upon the perceived failures of the United States, which only repeated the failures of the First Republic in its final years with President Carter and Reagan unable to pass meaningful legislation to end the crisis plaguing their governments, the King has contended that republicanism is a spent force and has asserted the indispensability of the monarchy to preserve stability and national unity. Notably, this propaganda effort has extolled the virtue of participatory democracy, advocating for a depoliticized populace that primarily focuses its attention on local issues rather than national concerns. To ensure that the public remains true to this form of democracy the King has now decreed that all political parties are to be banished from the Kingdom, stating that Spain is not a one-party state but rather a no-party state marking a noteworthy departure from conventional political systems and embracing a new future dominated by Carlist thought."

With this speech now solidifying the King’s standing among nationalists from all corners of the nation, the hope is that the Kingdom can now begin to put aside the divisive and tumultuous era created by decades of Bourbon-Anjou rule. Speaking further the King has also decreed the beginning of a new political campaign simply referred to as the Brotherhood Act which orders all to follow the simplistic teachings of Christ especially those taught within Luke 10:37. Whilst the nation has heralded this speech as a defining moment for the political development of the new Kingdom, many remain left out by this decree as this embrace of diversity has not extended to encompass gender or sexual diversity prompting some opponents of the King to brand him as a hypocrite. Demonstrating that the Carlist movement is still firmly rooted in its anti-sexual minority roots, these traditional values have done little to reassure the lingering Republican remnants that the King is on their side."

Now, following the establishment of a new arrangement, the Church has been offered to integrate its Councils into a direct and formal role in advising the King during the formation of policy. Additionally, Church officials have now also been appointed to various administrative positions within the Spanish government to facilitate their advisory role. This profound intertwining of Church and state heralds a distinct shift in the country’s political landscape, marking a notable departure from the secular inclinations that have characterized previous historical periods sending a clear message that the Church will never again be allowed to be diminished in its strength. Although the extent of influence wielded by the Church has now become the subject of ongoing discussions and scrutiny, with the implications of this new dynamic now being closely observed internationally, the King is assured that his new advisors will be a perfect fit for their role strengthening both the Carlist cause and dealing a decisive blow against the communists who still seek to tear our nation away from the teachings of Christ."

With these services receiving partial funding from the government, with some even supplemented by donations from wealthy individuals and businesses, the decision has sparked a degree of controversy due to concerns that it places access to essential welfare services into the hands of select individual entities with some charities being funded better than others in more remote areas. Alongside the concerns surrounding underfunding, the current setup of the charities has also been criticized for denying aid to certain individuals, in particular atheists and non-Catholics, raising questions about the supposed inclusivity and equal access espoused by the King following the establishment of these beneficial services."

However, one notable absence has now left many members of the public either angered or confused as to why the King has refused to bestow a title upon this highly popular figure within the royal family. Carlos Javier’s absence has raised several questions, whether his omission is due to his own refusal or due to the King’s refusal to recognize his nephew as a royal due to his socialist leanings is unknown. Regardless of which, the people are left saddened that a rift has now formed within the royal family with most accepting the situation and merely wishing for the Council of Princes to begin their duties and work towards the development of the Kingdom."

Now, after enduring the reigns of illegitimate monarchs, the turmoil of unholy republics, and the iron grip of egotistical fascists, the nation has finally returned to the hands and bosom of its rightful rulers. In a grand ceremony in Madrid, King [ROOT.Getleader] reaffirmed his love for his subjects, his people, and his nation. Acting as a second coronation, the King has now been declared the Father of Spain, a title bestowed upon himself and all his heirs, effectively cementing the Carlist lineage for centuries to come. With protests lining the streets outside of the Palacio Real de Madrid, calling such an event a sham and a stain on the Kingdom, it is evident that there remain lingering pockets of resistance to the Carlist rule, resistance that shall be swiftly put down. Appearing before his people shortly after his confirmation, King [ROOT.Getleader] emerged to a crowd that should have been present for his ancestors, a crowd that was overjoyed at the reunification of church and state, a crowd that was, at last, proud of their royalty, and a crowd that has been in the making since 1836."

For centuries, the Requetés have been the backbone of the Carlist military efforts, fighting in both the Carlist Wars and the Spanish Civil War, however, this integration comes with a significant caveat that will now ensure that their presence is more than the mere paramilitary force of old. Unlike the regular army, which is organized along traditional lines and under the control of the state, the Requetés are being directly integrated as a distinct force within the military, one that is loyal not to the state but to the King himself. Not bound to the recently established fueros, these loyal soldiers will answer directly to the crown itself, ensuring its protection and survival. While such a move has been celebrated by many Carlists, the creation of this royal guard within the ranks of the military has raised significant concerns from senior officials within the armed forces, who have argued that this parallel power structure has done little more than undermine the authority of the state over its armed forces and given the monarchy a potent tool to enforce its will independently of the government and military leadership. As tensions continue to deepen between the military and the Requetés, the King has requested a meeting between the leadership of both to settle the current state of affairs between the two and stop conflict in its tracks before it develops to a breaking point."

Now, following intense debate between the two sides, the entire armed forces have been mandated to swear allegiance to the royal family and the Carlist cause, allowing both sides to be equal in their recognition of whom they serve. While such sweeping reform did little to stop the immediate anger from members of the armed forces, who were again concerned about the continued centralization of power by the King, most were easily abated in their worries as a draft oath of loyalty was read to them, which followed similarly the British oath made by its soldiers. While there can be no doubt that the attempts made by the King to enshrine the Requetés as a parallel structure within the armed forces was an attempt to further centralize power around the monarch, the fears of it being used as the personal defense force have now been abated with this meeting, and the end of the swearing of allegiance to the state. However, seemingly unsatisfied with this resolution, the armed forces were able to request that the King himself, owing to his credentials as a veteran of the Spanish Legion, serve as an officially recognized member of the armed forces leading his soldiers on the battlefield. While this demand may have been out of place for the high command to demand, the King has welcomed this proposal with open arms, so long as he retains the right to conscript members of the armed forces into the Requetés if he deems it necessary."

This autonomy, however, has only been granted with the stipulation that each fuero continues to engage in free trade with other regions of Spain and that no region adopts communist or otherwise subversive economic practices. The effects of this decentralized approach have already been significant, regions that were previously struggling under a one-size-fits-all economic policy are now thriving, as they can implement policies that directly address their specific needs, with coastal fuero beginning to prioritize fishing and maritime trade seeing a near fifty percent expansion in the fishing industry. Moreover, this policy has helped to resolve many of the lingering issues with the economy, as inefficiencies are reduced, and economic growth has been more evenly distributed rather than concentrated in Madrid and other major cities. With economic challenges now largely overcome, Spain stands as a testament to the effectiveness of a decentralized approach to governance."

During Franco’s dictatorship, the Foreign Legion served as a gateway to Spanish citizenship for many, including the King himself, however, with the advent of the royal dictatorship, the Legion’s recruitment of foreign nationals dwindled, and the pathway to citizenship through military service was closed. Now, under Enrique V, the gates of the Foreign Legion have once again been reopened to foreigners, but with a significant caveat: only devout Catholics in good standing with their local churches shall be eligible. While this new policy has sparked a wave of interest from across the globe, the caveats have meant that many honest and willing Catholics are unable to enlist, if only because of their lack of convictions in the church and God. However, those who have been successful have arrived in mass, with an influx of foreign recruits now arriving and breathing a new lease of life into the Legion, which has suffered from neglect and a dwindling pool of candidates in recent years. Outside of the military benefits, the King has positioned this policy as a way for the millions suffering from oppression abroad to flee to the safety of a loving state that will ensure that they are no longer punished or harmed for their beliefs."

Not even the armed forces have been saved from this new policy, as an internal investigation into the military has now purged any sexual minority elements from its ranks, with the King arguing it was a necessary move to ensure the deviants in society are not able to weaken the defense of the Kingdom. To make the repression worse for those affected, new legislation has now barred these individuals from accessing welfare benefits provided by the King’s newly established social programs, effectively cutting them off from state support and further marginalizing them within society. Seeking to encompass all that is wrong with society in one fell swoop, the King has also decreed that the vile practice of abortion has been criminalized, with anyone caught undergoing, facilitating, or seeking an abortion now facing imprisonment for their heinous crime. Despite rising opposition to this legislation, which has been branded as an evil and insidious perversion of God’s teachings, the King has simply claimed that any seeking to protest against this reform are not children of God and are likely communist subversives, granting the police free reign to arrest all who seek to support the growing sexual minority resistance movement."

As a member of the Order, sitting as the head of the Jerusalem Obedience, a sect renowned for its staunch anti-communist, anti-liberal, and fervently Catholic ideology, the alliance has not been unexpected, however, the extent of the integration has brought forward some cause for concern for various priests. While the alignment between the Order and the King has led to a more unified and ideologically consistent advisory body, the priests that have been replaced have now been cast aside, unable to voice their opinions on stately matters, undoing the potential for internal dissent but simultaneously making the King and the Order’s interpretation of the Bible the only official doctrine that will be enforced across the Kingdom. While it is uncertain if this invitation will begin to drive a wedge between the King and the Church, one thing is for certain, the Oder’s entrance into the highest echelons of government has created an environment where the King will face little opposition to any future opposition, allowing for the unimpeded implementation of his vision for Spain, effectively perfecting the royal dictatorship that Jaun Carlos had begun."

With his ties to the Bourbon dynasty, Enrique harbors a legitimate, albeit dormant, claim to the French throne- a claim he is now positioning as central to his broader vision for a unified Iberian and French kingdom. The King’s ambitions, however, were not merely a personal fantasy; these desires reflected a broader strategy to expand the influence of Carlist rule beyond Spain’s borders and forge a powerful Catholic empire in Western Europe, one that stood as a bulwark against secularism, liberalism, and republicanism that have dominated the region for centuries. To this end, Enrique has now begun laying the groundwork for this ambitious project calling on the military to begin drafting plans for an invasion of France. While this plan may sound ambitious, with generals already concerned about how the armed forces would cross the Pyrenees mountains, the King is confident that within the next few years, he will stand in Reims and be crowned as the King of a united Franco-Iberian Kingdom."

This “three-tiered system” as King Javier calls it seeks to equalize Spanish society as a whole. This applies to both living conditions and legal protections, with all in Spain being afforded the same amenities, regardless of racial, ethnic, sexual, and gender identity. Legal scholars have also pointed out that this move essentially legalizes gay marriage, though this was not implicitly stated in the King’s announcement. Those on the right have decried this as a blatant abuse of power, as well as calling it a bastardization of something out of the communist playbook.

High-ranking officials and officers within the Carlist Party have now been appointed to oversee the organization and management of these funds, preparing them for their fair redistribution among the people. However, some sectors of the public have expressed extreme criticism over the decision, arguing that such aggressive interference is tantamount to communism, the very ideal that the people of Spain have fought against since the eradication of the Second Spanish Republic. While King Javier remains a popular figure in the eyes of many of the working class, who have instead argued that this decision is one long in the waiting, tensions are now bubbling intentionally or not among the various classes of the Kingdom with the decision to side with the poorer working class over that of the wealthy businessman a growing cause for concern for some figures within the armed forces."

This, according to the government, is not the figure the Spanish military should continue to emulate. In a move that is stirring debate within military ranks, King Carlos Javier has announced a comprehensive military re-education program aimed at shifting this outdated focus. Instead of idolizing Franco, military personnel will now study and emulate generals like Zhukov and Tito- leaders known for their tactical brilliance and battlefield successes. While controversial, particularly given the communist backgrounds of both Zhukov and Tito, the program emphasizes that the focus is on their military strategies, not their politics- with the Battle of Berlin and Neretva being given particular emphasis. Hoping to promote a deepened understanding of both partisan tactics and urban warfare, the King believes that only through the studies of the greatest tacticians will the Spanish military ever see success again. However, this decision is not without opposition, with many criticizing the belief that these two individuals could ever successfully lead armies as Franco had done.

Now, as a direct result of this defection, the Requetés have been fully integrated into the Spanish military. With their influence within the party growing, these brave patriots and devoted socialists have quickly been jokingly referred to as the Royalist Commissars, a title King Javier has more than willingly embraced, seeing as the effectiveness of the Requetés has long been known to many throughout the centuries. Coinciding with the official conclusion of the military re-education program, the armed forces have been thoroughly transformed. After a series of reforms aimed at depoliticizing, modernizing, and streamlining the military, the Requeté's involvement has effectively politicized the institution under the banner of the Carlist Party.

Despite the confusing title, which has brought endless criticism from all sides of the political aisle, this has not come as a shock to the devoted followers of the Carlist Party, who have long embraced the party's followings of Titoism as early as the 1970s. While the label of socialist has come as no surprise, given the King's long-standing rhetoric and policies that have increasingly aligned with socialist principles, the Federal aspect of the new Spanish Kingdom has brought a shock to many, despite confirmation that the title remains entirely symbolic, with promises of decentralization failing to gain momentum either by direct influence of the King or his council. With a new dawn now emerging for the Kingdom, it has yet to be seen whether or not the new model envisioned by the King will be successful. While it cannot be denied that his blending of socialism within a monarchist system has borne fruit for much of the economy and military, the same cannot be said for much of society, which has remained headstrong in its conservative beliefs. To make matters worse, many believe such a proclamation is unnecessary and traps the Kingdom into passing reforms to strengthen the rights of various communities when there has not been, and likely never will be an emphasis on these people.

Just as fueros once empowered local communities with self-rule, the King argues that workers should have the same power over their labor. In a groundbreaking move, the government is now mandating that all workplaces, whether unionized or not, must hold elections for managerial and administrative positions. This shift is being justified as a natural extension of workplace democracy, where workers have the right to elect their leadership in the spirit of self-management. The combination of fuerismo and socialism has, as expected, been a tough sell to many individuals across the Kingdom who have seemingly clung to the belief that fuerismo should only affect local autonomy and not be utilized by the workforce for their advancement. However, despite this continued confusion, the King shows no sign of stopping his merger of two previously ideologically opposed ideals, seeing that if Spain is to modernize, drastic action must be taken, and the truth of Titoism must be upheld.

Following decades of neglect by Franco and the false Kings of the House of Bourbon, the government has now announced the construction of new businesses, handouts of stimulus checks to rural citizens, and the establishment of a new economic board that will seek to address the deeply rooted economic inequality that has persisted for centuries. Infrastructure improvements are also underway, with new roads, utilities, and public services being established to connect isolated villages and improve access to markets. Additionally, the development plan will seek to aid our nation's farmers by subsidizing the purchase of modern equipment and tools, which is already boosting productivity and improving the efficiency of traditional industries like olive oil and wine production. This program is designed to lift rural regions out of poverty and integrate them more fully into our broader socialist economy. The reforms are already easing the country’s economic struggles, and as Andalusia and other rural regions experience modernization, the benefits are rippling throughout the Kingdom, alleviating unemployment and promoting social cohesion.

Already the crown Labor Commission has made a substantial impact, drafting and enacting key policies that support the ongoing modernization of Spain's economy. By pushing for greater investment in infrastructure, industry, and labor rights, the commission has accelerated the country's economic transformation, helping Spain finally shed the remnants of its outdated economic system. As the unions work closely with the monarchy, the economy has stabilized, and industries across Spain are seeing rapid growth. The agricultural, manufacturing, and service sectors are all benefiting from new policies aimed at increasing efficiency, productivity, and workers' quality of life.

Historically the imposition of this policy was done as a means to attract support from the Basques and Catalan peoples, who saw the fueros as a guarantee of their distinct regional identities. However, given the recent tensions within the Kingdom, the King has reinterpreted fuerismo as a form of federalism. Under this new system a series of regional governments, across the Kingdom, not just in the traditionally hostile regions, have been granted significant autonomy. These new federations, while not as powerful as their historical counterparts, are a major step forward in decentralizing power. Each region will hold local elections, create its laws, and manage local governance. Importantly, while the King retains the right to veto legislation if necessary, the regions enjoy enough freedom to address local concerns independently. This reinterpretation has proven popular and has already begun calming separatist tensions in numerous historically restive regions, despite continued opposition from the most extreme separatists.

spain.327.d:0 "In a historic turn of events, King Carlos Javier managed to both restore the rightful Bourbon monarchy and usher in a socialist revolution, merging two seemingly opposing forces into a singular vision for Spain’s future. This achievement represents the culmination of centuries of effort to restore the throne to its rightful claimants and to install the ideals begun in Trier in 1818. Under the King’s rule, regional languages, once marginalized, are thriving. Catalan, Basque, Galician, and other local tongues have seen a cultural renaissance, supported by government programs that aim to preserve and elevate the rich diversity of Spain’s national identities. The federal structure, with its local autonomies, has pacified long-standing separatist movements, bringing together regional pride and national unity under the crown. Class disparities, once a source of immense social tension, have been minimized through the implementation of socialist policies that prioritize worker empowerment and equitable wealth distribution. The reformed military, once plagued by outdated Francoist ideals, has been modernized, with new doctrines based on the strategic brilliance of generals like Zhukov and Tito. On the economic front, Spain enjoys a level of prosperity not seen in decades. Living standards across the board have risen, with rural and urban areas alike benefiting from infrastructure projects, stimulus packages, and targeted investments that have invigorated key industries. The economy, once volatile, is now stable and thriving, a testament to the success of the King’s socialist agenda. After years of suffering, Spain is once more prosperous."

spain.329.d:0 "In a bold move to further solidify the role of labor in governance, King Carlos Javier has mandated that all federations within the Socialist Federal Kingdom of Spain must now include labor councils as an integral part of their local governments. This unprecedented shift ensures that every federation, from Catalonia to Andalusia, has a legislative body with representatives directly elected from the region's trade unions. These labor councils are tasked with safeguarding workers' rights, ensuring fair labor practices, and actively participating in the formulation of local laws and policies. With the trade unions now embedded in the political framework, the working class holds significant influence over the governance of their respective regions. This reform has bolstered democratic socialism at the grassroots level, empowering unions to act as the voice of the people within the federal structure. While some traditionalists view this as an overreach, still contesting the truth of the King’s commitment to socialism and Titoism, the King has framed the integration of labor councils as a continuation of the Carlist legacy of fuerismo, where local autonomy and community leadership are paramount. By ensuring worker representation in every federation, the King’s government has reinforced its commitment to both regional self-governance and labor empowerment, creating a truly union-driven political system across Spain."

While these militias must be cleared by the government and are required to include members of the Requetés, the move has quickly gained popularity among the working class. This policy grants unions and labor councils a direct hand in the nation’s defense, effectively blending military and labor interests in a way unseen in modern Spain. The inclusion of Requetés ensures that the militias maintain loyalty to the crown and the state while at the same time giving organized labor a degree of autonomy and influence over military affairs. This dual structure not only strengthens the military but also intertwines it with the interests of Spain's workers, making them stakeholders in national security. Already, several prominent unions, ranging from the UGT to the CCOO have begun raising militias, which are viewed as both protectors of the socialist state and symbols of labor’s new empowerment. While these militias are being carefully watched by the Requetés, because both unions have been courted by the Communist Party in the past, their willingness to engage with the program has shown that even the most ardent of Marxists are beginning to accept their Socialist Kingdom."

The King, in a highly controversial statement, has declared and upheld his belief, despite the protests of the Church, that the Pope is less of a spiritual leader divinely chosen by God and more of a foreign monarch with his agenda that has been influencing Spain for millennia. This move redefines the balance of power between the crown and the Catholic Church, with the King asserting his sovereignty over religious matters. While the government will continue to uphold Catholic values, papal decrees will no longer be automatically respected unless they align with the teachings of Carlism, or align with divine will rather than the interests of a foreign ruler. The decision underscored the King’s desire for continued independence for the people of Spain, shifting away from the dominance of centralized authority, even linking his break with the concept of fuerismo. As expected, this break has done little to please the clergy, with many now resigning from their position as advisors to the King until he comes to his senses. Yet, with the King refusing to budge on the matter, and seeing the growing support from socialist elements across the Kingdom, it appears as if the break is here to stay."

Traditionally remembered as conservative reactionaries, these figures are now being recast as flawed but progressive for their time, with the key focus of their rehabilitation being on their roots as working-class Catholics who fought for God, labor, and the decentralization of Spain. This revisionist project portrays these Carlists as champions of social justice, aligning heavily with the agenda of Carlism. While such a project has largely been questioned by historians, who are acutely aware of the realities of these men's lives, the emphasis placed on their advocacy of local autonomy and economic equality, has been useful in continuing to persuade the masses of the Carlists legacy of progress, somehow even managing to convince various conservative elements to support the King. With figures such as Carlos V, Ramón Cabrera, and Carlos VII now receiving much-needed alterations to their historical record, which still maintains their desire to return Spain to a highly centralized and conservative state, the doors have now been opened for further revisions to be made to the historical record, with keen interest being placed on Emilio Mola who, like the heroes of old, played a crucial role in the development of Spain but who has been denounced throughout history as a military strongman hellbent on authoritarianism. With any questioning of this rectification of history being quickly censored, the Carlist heroes of old may now live on in the modern day, cleared of all their supposed wrongdoing, inspiring millions to fight for decentralization and equality."

The United Left, an umbrella organization composed of communists, syndicalists, democratic socialists, and various other ideologies, has long cooperated with the Carlist Party and the King’s policies, though have been eager to maintain their independence to avoid direct association with their supposed arch-nemesis. However, following intense negotiations, the diametrically opposed foes have now finally set aside their differences and joined as one with the United Front now becoming a direct partner of the Carlist Party. The agreement now sees various socialists entering government for the first time in decades, following a tense and strict redefinition of what constitutes a political party given that all bar the Carlist Party remain outlawed. Having had the United Left establish itself as the official representative of the various union militias that exist under the careful watch of the Requetés, the King is now allowed to appoint a new wave of ministers, drawn from the diverse ranks of the United Left, ensuring that these necessary socialist voices have direct input on shaping the nation’s policies. With socialists now entering the government, purified of their anti-monarchist sentiment, it appears as though the Carlist Party has done what many thought impossible, with King Carlos Javier now sitting atop a nation of red caps and red souls."

In the eyes of the PCE, an army not completely enraptured by the message of the party is one that cannot be predicted and thus not trusted. It also further enables the communist regime to utilize the military as an arm of the government to quash dissent. The measure, therefore, seeks to reinvent the army as a tool not only to protect the populace from perceived outside threats but from those to the interior as well.

Notable individuals in the military who have been outspoken critics of the communist party have been marched to the gallows, bayonets at their backs. Most stood defiant in the face of death, their expressions only changing if the gallows failed to snap their necks, leading them to a slow, excruciating death. The regime has labeled these individuals as traitors and Francoists, encouraging the populace to rejoice in the purification of the military’s ranks from subversive elements. With the PCE’s purge of the military, as well as the introduction of commissars to the rank and file, the Frutos regime largely sees the issue of the military taken care of. While attendance to these public executions was substantial, one could not help but notice the downward glances some held as the bodies of former national heroes swung silently in the courtyards across Spain."

This will, however, drastically affect those who previously owned these financial institutions and those who had deposited large sums of money in them, as all of their wealth has now been redirected to the coffers of the Spanish government. The Spanish media has praised the move as an important step in redistributing the wealth of the one percent. Much of the upper echelons of Spanish society have lost their entire fortunes overnight, effectively being kicked down the social ladder to once again be mere members of the working class. The PCE sees this as a tremendous victory for the development of their future classless utopia, and few from the former ultra-rich dare voice their grievances publicly. In the eyes of the state, the people’s wealth has been restored to them by the decisive actions of the people’s government."

Behind closed doors however, whispers have been heard of livid party members decrying this move as nothing more than a shameless power grab meant to consolidate even more control for the PCE. Despite these supposed qualms, the integration has largely calmed down the general strikes which have plagued the country as of late; as the leaders of the various leftist political parties are now no longer able to openly criticize the government.

Reports have flooded in of arrests being made to priests who refuse to renounce their ways and swear loyalty to the party. These children of God weep with the knowledge that one of the last bastions of faith in Europe has finally been excised. Reactions to the news have been mixed. While Spain is a Catholic dominated country, many have regardless sworn off religion out of fear for their lives, and large demonstrations in support of the actions taken by the Spanish government have been seen across the country.

While this new federal model has granted a degree of local autonomy to the various Socialist Federations and their First Secretaries, it is clear, and largely expected, that real power remains concentrated in the hands of the Central Committee and General Secretary Frutos. Even though regional autonomy remains limited in practice, this federal reorganization has been successful in calming separatist tensions that have long plagued Spain. The formal recognition of regional identities within the framework of socialism has, for the time being, appeased most of the remaining nationalist movements. However, reactionaries and fascists have insisted on their opposition to the plan, seeing local rule as a mere symbolic gesture, presenting the benevolence of Comrade Frutos as nothing more than a sham to silence opposition."

While Spain’s rapid industrialization under Comrade Frutos has been marked by necessarily harsh and often unforgiving policies, the General Secretary’s plans for rural reform reveal a softer touch. Growing up in a farming family himself, Comrade Frutos has a deep personal connection to Spain’s farmers and seems keen to ensure that the transition to collective farms is more humane, going as far as to suggest that the plight of the peasant farmer is of more concern to the revolution than that of the cozy urban industrialist. Landlords, long viewed as exploiters of the rural poor, are being swiftly removed from their holdings. In their place, collective farms are being established, bringing land under the control of the workers who actually cultivate it. Alongside the collectivization efforts, Comrade Frutos has pledged to invest heavily in rural infrastructure, improving roads, irrigation, and access to essential services, ensuring that farming communities benefit from the nation’s modernization. This approach has been met with cautious optimism from rural workers, many of whom appreciate the focus on improving living conditions, even as they adapt to the new collective system, proving that communism can work in both the city and the country."

This systematic campaign has crushed the remnants of nationalist resistance, sending a clear message that no region will be allowed to challenge the authority of the central government. However, despite the widespread nature of this purge, the General Secretary has been willing to show clemency to those willing to side with the Communist Party, presenting a clear and decisive ultimatum: assist us in rounding up fascists across these regions and be welcomed as a hero to the Republic. While such action hasn’t been kept by certain members of the state security who reportedly suffered from a failure of communications during the initial purge, many have now been welcomed back and have been offered positions working with the newly appointed First Secretaries of the Socialist Federations.

Initially proposed by the PSOE during the first civil war by  Francisco Largo Caballero, the idea has now once more come to the forefront of discussion, with the Central Committee voting unanimously for its establishment. Already sweeping reforms have begun across the peninsula, with maps being altered destroying the previous border between Spain and Portugal, with the updated version now showing the Portuguese Socialist Federation in the place of its predecessor. The Portuguese Communist Party has now likewise been subsumed into the broader Communist Party of Iberia, now functioning as one of a plethora of subsections of the ever-growing vanguard. Yet, despite this renaming and gradual integration of Portugal, elements of resistance are now beginning to show their fascistic roots with the citizens of the Portuguese Socialist Federation now attempting to overthrow our rule and re-establish their state in a misguided following of nationalism. While the dream of a united Iberia is realized on paper, it will take much longer for the people of our Republic to truly be united under a common banner, with the Communist Party now taking inspiration from the Soviet Union’s policies to tackle a similar insurrection in Ukraine, and the Caucasus."

To expand its influence across the Republic, and ensure all children are receiving a meaningful education in Marxist doctrine, the UJCE has now absorbed the Socialist Youth of Spain, formerly a part of the PSOE, with its leadership more than eagerly signing away control of their movement to the party. Through intense political education programs, the UJCE is ensuring that young people are well-versed in party doctrine and ready to contribute to the state’s socialist transformation. The youth are being well educated in the virtues of collectivism, the importance of state loyalty, and the necessity of defending the revolution and General Secretary Frutos from all threats. This mass mobilization of young Spaniards extends into military preparedness, with the UJCE acting as a direct pipeline into the armed forces as, upon reaching the appropriate age, members are expected to seamlessly transition from the UJCE into the military, fully prepared to serve the Republic at a moments notice."

Simultaneously, agricultural collectivization, once controversial, has finally yielded remarkable efficiency and output, solidifying food security and laying the groundwork for further rural development. Likewise, perhaps expectedly, the unification of Iberia under the Union of Iberian Soviet Republics has further accelerated economic growth, as the combined resources and labor of both nations have been integrated into a cohesive system. With nationalism now a dwindling issue, the General Secretary’s vision for a prosperous society in which every worker, peasant, and prole no matter their background has been successful. Gone are the days of an economic backwater that was as productive as the faltering state of the American Republic, gone are the days where feudal lords dictated land tax, and gone are the days of Kings and their robbery of the poor. The new Iberia, a socialist powerhouse where the old crown now lies shattered, now stands as a beacon of economic strength in Europe. Its factories produce goods for both domestic consumption and export, while advanced infrastructure projects ensure the smooth movement of resources and products.

While still in its early days, with the first phases of the plan seeing nationalist leaders from Tangier relocated to isolated rural areas of mainland Spain, with thousands more being forcibly resettled in Tangier, the plan has been resoundingly successful. Framing this as a necessary step to unify Tangier and the African proletariat with the larger goal of the Republic, the General Secretary has promised further relocation plans for select individuals. Yet a brief pause has been granted to the party, with elements seeking to challenge the General Secretary’s plans, arguing that the hotbed that was created in Kazakhstan under the watch of Comrade Stalin and Malenkov should bring into question the feasibility of this plan. Yet, with the General Secretary arguing that the relocation plans to Kazakhstan had largely been successful, that any concerns are being addressed in a timely and organized manner, and that a comparison between the two states is a poor argument owing to the size and population difference, the plan has been decreed viable.

Traditionally a monolithic entity operated entirely by the state, the SV is now being restructured into a more complex network of trade unions, each ostensibly autonomous but ultimately under the control of the government. Bencomo’s reforms, however, are not only reshaping the landscape of labor across the nation but are also having a profound impact on the ongoing general strike, significantly weakening its momentum and sowing discord among the various illegal leftist organizations. Under Bencomo’s leadership, the SV is evolving from a single, state-operated union into a syndicate of multiple trade unions, each aligned with specific interests, with the hope that the restructuring will diversify its representation within the labor movement, with plans already being established for the allowance of corporate and rural membership into the union. With the economy now beginning to see a rebound, the reform has proven effective in paralyzing the organizational capabilities of the opposition, as various unions who have been struggling under the weight of a prolonged strike, have begun to abandon their ties to the UGT, CCOO, and CNT hoping that through their denouncement of their past affiliations, the SV will be welcoming to them. With a web of unions now slowly becoming connected to the SV, each working against one another to gain the favor of the government, the strikes shall soon be eradicated, and all that will remain is a unified workforce loyal to Bencomo and the Falangist cause."

While these leaders now enjoy more political clout and cushy government benefits, their actual power over policymaking remains limited- serving more as figureheads than genuine influencers of policy. Nevertheless, the allure of these rewards has sparked a wave of defections from the major leftist syndicates, fracturing the opposition and effectively bringing the general strike to an end. The end of the general strike marks a decisive victory for the government, which has not only neutralized the last vestiges of resistance to the authority of Bencomo but has reasserted the government’s authority over the labor movement, ensuring that the communist evils that still linger in the shadows will never again be able to rise to a position to challenge the government again. However, despite the communists having been defeated here, their presence still lingers across various unions and sectors of society, presenting a challenge that can only be resolved through further reform. With resistance futile, Bencomo has now successfully ensured that the labor movement is nothing more than a tool for maintaining order and advancing the state agenda, as the remaining leftist syndicates now lie fractured and demoralized despite their continued presence in the shadows of the nation."

Hoping that by spinning the narrative and painting the former Caudillo as a man of the people who, through sheer determination and a profound sense of duty, led the fight to protect the nation from oppression, chaos, and destruction at the hands of Moscow, the strike movement will dissipate or at least dissuade new members from joining its ranks. In this carefully curated historical narrative, Franco’s struggle against Bolshevism has been portrayed not just as a political or military campaign but as a moral crusade to safeguard the livelihoods and values of the nation, with Falangist rhetoric now positioning him as the leader of the masses who understood the needs of the workers and fought tirelessly to create an economy that served their interests- through the promotion of corporatism, the protection of national industries, and the suppression of radicalism. However, this effort has been met with a backlash that has undermined its effectiveness, with many pointing to the so-called economic liberalization of the state that integrated Spain into the global market during the 1960s as direct evidence that Franco was nothing more than a pawn of capitalist interests, as well as the known crackdown against moderate elements and citizens who merely dared to speak out against oppression.

Funded by increased taxation on the wealthy and nobility, this initiative marks a significant shift in the party’s approach to economic and social governance, bleeding elements of fascist corporatism with Keynesian economics to create a unique model of state-managed welfare and economic stability. This new welfare state, as envisioned by Bencomo, is designed to address the root causes of social unrest by improving the living conditions of Spain’s working class without forcing them to pay the brunt of the cost to receive the benefits. However, this policy of redistribution of wealth through a largely progressive form of taxation has done little to bring the upper classes and established nobility to the side of the government, who now believe that the Falangist movement has become the very thing it swore to protect them from. Even the King has weighed in on the matter, demanding that Bencomo either undo his aggressive form of taxation or find a new way to fund his project or else risk the possibility of a split between the head of state and head of government. Yet, despite these threats, Bencomo has refused to budge, arguing that in the long term, the benefits of this new welfare model will far outweigh the costs.

Now, following intense discussion on how best to proceed with this reform, rural landowners, their employees, and tenant farmers have been forced to join the Sindicato Vertical, bringing them under the same legislation and regulation as their urban counterparts. Under the guise of promoting class cooperation and mitigating radicalism, the government has also pledged to implement further reforms to the SV, improving labor conditions, modernization of agricultural practices, and a blanket raise of wages for those working the land. However, despite these improvements and forced integration into the SV, power on the land remains firmly in the hands of the landowners, as traditional hierarchy has been preserved, with the state ensuring that the reforms pledged do not upset the natural balance that has been in place since seemingly time immemorial. Now, the agricultural sector, once seen as a backward and inefficient part of the economy, has the opportunity to contribute as an equal to its industrial counterpart, ushering in an era of economic prosperity for both the city and the countryside."

Declaring that under his leadership, Spain is beholden to neither the excesses of capitalist exploitation nor the rigid dogma of socialism, Bencomo has described his model, his nation, as a proud national syndicalist state, where corporatism reigns supreme as the foundation of economic and social order. Drawing applause from a room full of party members, Bencomo was keen to highlight his plans for the future of Spain, declaring that there shall never come a time when Spain is subservient to the wishes of Ottawa or the demands of Berlin, claiming that like Franco before him, he shall work to place the Spanish people first. Ending with a symphony of applause, this fiery rhetoric has now been dispatched to all corners of the Republic, allowing Bencomo to continue to consolidate his control over local governments and small enclaves who may still feel disillusioned with the path of government. While the opposition may decry this speech as confusing and contradictory, the people realize the truth, and that is that Third Positionism, National Syndicalism, and Falangism, works for them and will never stop working for them."

Once a rallying cry for Falangists who embraced violence as a tool as political struggle, the doctrine has now been repurposed for the modern day, with the government making it clear that those who choose to take matters into their own hands will not face consequences if their actions are seen as necessary to quash the enemies of the Republic. As a result of this legalization of militia action the streets have now been filled with brave men, operating under the implicit protection of Bencomo and the government, who have begun targeting anyone suspected of challenging the regime’s authority or attempting to revive leftist movements. Labor organizers, student activists, and community leaders have now been dragged before hastily made tribunals and deemed guilty before a jury of their peers before being left bloody and beaten on the streets, before being handed to local police to ensure their arrest. While this policy has not been completely effective, with militia’s targeting one another in some instances, the atmosphere of fear that has descended upon left-leaning communities across the Republic has made the minor faults of the doctrine inconsequential."

This entwinement has been a cornerstone of the nation, ensuring that the values of the government were deeply rooted in both governance and daily life. However, recent developments have seen this relationship take an even more extreme turn. [Root.Getleader], in their desire to ensure the continuity of the laws that Franco sought to maintain, has now begun appointing the most fervently ideological priests to high-ranking political offices, including key cabinet positions and seats in the Cortes Españolas. Unprecedented in its scope and implications, the appointment has sent a shockwave across the nation, with the lingering elements of resistance calling for the immediate separation of church and state. While clergy have previously held government roles, these were often lay members of the Church who navigated the delicate balance between religious duty and statecraft. Now, however, these priests, loyal as they are, are expected to wield significant influence over legislation, particularly related to education, social policy, and internal security. This strategy of placing die-hard priests in power signals a new phase for the regime’s evolution, one where secularism now lies in a shallow grave next to the communists who seek to undermine the success of our reforms."

Decried as scabs by the leftist agitators on the streets, many of these workers have already been threatened by their once-trusted co-workers, who have now begun to try to prevent them from working by utilizing violence to their advantage. To defend these honest workers from harm army units have now been dispatched to guard these brave citizens, protecting them from the radicals who still refuse to see the folly of their ways and remain on the side of tyranny and economic decline. While this strategy has not brought the general strike crashing down, with [ROOT.Getleader] having hoped that the presence of the military would have been enough to end all hopes held by the strikers for a favorable settlement, it has thoroughly discouraged many strikers from returning to the picket line, convincing them to return to work or at least tone down their rhetoric. While the effects of the strike are slowly being undone, there remains a worrying sense among the government of the long-term consequences of this movement as well as the fear that the recently formed unions have still clung to a sense of power despite the crackdown against them. Regardless of the future, one thing is certain, the cracks have begun to show in the general strike, and it is now at risk of becoming another failure for socialism, all but ensuring [ROOT.Getleader]’s rule over the nation."

Beginning with low-level labor militants, we have used a plethora of information extraction tactics to work our way up the network of strike leaders, discovering the identities and locations of a majority of the most important figures in this leftist insurgency. With the proverbial head of the snake removed, the general strike has lost its steam, and those who have not been arrested have at last returned to work, returning the country’s industries to their former capacity. With the general strike defeated, now is a time for celebration before we begin our plans to restore Spain to the glory of the Franco era.

Given the specifics of this integration, the process has been anything but complex, as a comprehensive reorganization of ranks and a rigorous retraining program has begun. Traditionally, both the police and the military have used a similar naming structure for their ranks, but with distinct roles and responsibilities, creating confusion over whether a lieutenant of the police force would maintain this rank following the merger. To streamline this process, and avoid infighting among the police and armed forces, ranks have now been realigned to fit a unified command structure under military oversight, allowing members of the police force to maintain their existing rank once they have undergone training to adapt to the military’s more rigid discipline and combat-focused protocols. While critics have argued that this integration effectively places Spain under martial law in all but name, the Caudillo has insisted that by transferring law enforcement duties to the military, the government has significantly reduced the likelihood of dissent within the ranks and ensured that the nation safety can be monitored more carefully now that the armed forces, with its much more advanced technology, are working side-by-side the police."

Conservatives within the Cortes have demanded that the historic coat of arms be maintained alongside its royal crown. However, maintaining such a flag has come under fire from much of the opposition, who have seen the historic flag as holding the Republic back from advancing into the future and moving past the memory of dictatorship. With demands of reclamation of the flag being insisted, arguing that maintaining the flag would allow for the acknowledgment of the past while continuing the transition towards a republican government, others have suggested a radical change. Proposing a return to the First Republic in 1870, some have suggested that the monarchist coat of arms be altered into a Roman civic wreath to highlight the end of monarchist symbolism within government. With the two options being put before the public, the people of Spain now decide in the first referendum of the new Republic whether to move beyond monarchist symbolism or maintain it."

However, this is also National Democracy’s party flag, and so changing the flag in this way might attract controversy, especially since there are many who already feel that the Unitary Republic is a vanity project of National Democracy. In hopes of avoiding this, officials have also proposed an alternative flag. Originally created and proposed by government officials in the First Spanish Republic in the 1870s, the flag retains the traditional coat of arms associated with Spain, but removes all overt symbolism of the royal family and replaces crowns with the wreath of the Roman Republic."

While once a tool for managing labor relations- where it effectively controlled both workers and employers within a single hierarchical structure- the Sindicato Vertical will now be reimagined to serve as a regulatory body focused on enhancing economic efficiency and safety, operating with a much broader mandate with a larger goal of streamlining Spain’s economic activity. Though the new organization will retain its status as a mandatory trade union, with workers and employers still required to be part of the organization, the Sindicato Vertical will no longer manage the day-to-day management of labor disputes, instead handing these disputes off to a secondary sub-section of the main union, to allow it to prioritize its attention on monitoring compliance with regulations, optimizing production processes, and implementing safety protocols. The impact on the economy has already been noted, with the SV enforcing efficiency and safety standards across industries, productivity has surged, having a ripple effect on investor confidence both domestically and internationally. However, despite economic recovery now beginning, socialists have continued to denounce the new union, claiming it represents nothing short of state control over economic life, demanding that all laborers boycott the organization, regardless of the benefits it offers."

Going beyond simple rhetoric, this comprehensive and strategic effort has gone as far as to enshrine [ROOT.Getleader] as the new Caudillo, leveraging historical figures and nationalist symbols to solidify his claim to power and legitimacy. Central to the strategy to create this functioning cult of personality is the revival of iconic figures from Spain’s past, particularly those associated with the nationalist cause. Miguel and Antonio Primo de Rivera, and Emilio Mola have now been reintroduced into the public consciousness with renewed vigor, with street art and statues depicting the three now littering the streets of Madrid and other major cities. Likewise, this campaign has also been meticulously crafted through a combination of state-sponsored propaganda, public appearances, and a reimagining of Spanish history. With state media outlets under strict control, the ability to elevate the new Caudillo to the same position as his predecessor has become increasingly easy, with the media now using effective imagery of Franco and [ROOT.Getleader] stood side-by-side with statements arguing that both fought against the Godless evils so that the nation may live in peace. With historical revisionism now abound, as even the schooling system begins to implement the desires of the government, the new Caudillo is slowly becoming a respected figure across the nation, and while the international media has decried this as a step away from the hopes that Juan Carlos I brought upon his ascension to power, it has become increasingly clear that the days of liberal reform are now finally over, replaced by the promise of a brighter future under Caudillo [ROOT.Getleader]."

While a draconian measure, the government has defended the motion, claiming that it aims to cement Spain as a monolithic Catholic state, purging any threats to its survival and ensuring that the enemies of the state are finally eradicated before they once again gain the strength to plunge the nation into civil war. As expected, the ramifications of this decree are immediate and far-reaching, as thousands of families, many of whom have lived in Spain for generations, now find themselves in a state of panic and uncertainty. The logistical nightmare of forced conversion has also caused significant strain on the government and churches, as thousands now line up to be officially recognized as true followers of Christ, and legitimate citizens of Spain. With many refusing to convert, the decree has created a profound humanitarian crisis as thousands of former citizens have now been made stateless and forced out of the country with no clear destination. With Europe having already dealt with one influx of citizens following the descent of Libya into anarchy, the Godless states of the Warsaw Pact, continuously gripped by division, now face once more the threat of hundreds of thousands marching into their borders. With makeshift camps being established near the Pyrenees, all it would take is the arrival of the armed forces to cleanse this menace from our borders once and for all.

Under this new system, the Kingdom shall remain, but the role of the King shall be reduced to little more than a ceremonial figurehead, with all real power concentrated in the hands of the military. Mindful of the turbulence that ensued when the monarchy regained control after Franco’s death, the government has made it clear that such a risk will never be taken again, speaking with the King and informing him that the regency shall never again declare him or his heirs as a successor to the Caudillo, stating that the mandate held by the Caudillo as guardian of the throne, now lies with the military as a whole, meaning that once [ROOT.Getleader] passes, it will be the military who will oversee the governance of Spain and will gain the authority to appoint a new head of state. This new arrangement, echoing the desires of Primo de Rivera, has effectively transferred the Kingdom into a constitutional monarchy governed by an autocratic, one-party, military dictatorship, with the King more than happy and eager to sit and watch as his government acts to reform the state into their image."

In parliament, this shift has also become quite visible, with conservative factions within the two parties holding meetings, signaling a clear convergence of agendas between the two, which has now spilled into the Cortes with the two parties beginning to vote in tandem on the same pieces of legislation despite previously being at odds due to legislation either being too moderate or too extreme.

However, People’s Party representatives are adamant that the request is entirely constitutional, claiming that if the King himself supports the initiative, it cannot be deemed unconstitutional. While the argument has hinged entirely upon judicial interpretations of the monarchy’s powers, the request has been allowed to stand. Now, seeking to preserve and defend the Kingdom, the King will utilize his influential position to sway ministers into supporting legislation that the ruling party has deemed necessary to pass, in effect becoming the chief whip of the Cortes. Alongside this, the King now will use his addresses to the public to declare his support for legislation, explaining bills clearly in the hope of building national support for legislation putting further pressure on the opposition and People’s Party to support the government in their effort to bring forth a modern Kingdom."

However, while a majority of members had voted to be subsumed under the People’s Party banner, the remnants of the opposition to the plan have instead elected to maintain their independence arguing that the unification is against their wishes and will do more harm than good to the cause of Spanish conservatism. This continuation of One Spain, however, has been met with significant challenges, because much of the leadership of One Spain had supported their integration leaving the continuation party as nothing short of a husk of its former self. Unable to appeal to many conservatives, who have viewed the organization as a traitor to conservatism that seeks to divide the nation and allow for the easy election of the opposition, it is unlikely that the continuation of One Spain will ever see political office again. Political analysts have, however, suggested that such a divide may shift the new coalition of One Spain and the People’s Party further to the right in the future, however, the overarching analysis is that this reunification will bring greater cohesion to the right wing in Spain, enabling the People’s Party to wield more influence in parliament and push forward with the necessary conservative agenda needed to modernize the Kingdom."

Throughout Spain, the provinces have a varying balance of power between the UGT, CNT, CCOO, and USO, but in the Basque Country all four of the mainstream syndicates are dwarfed by the local Basque Workers Solidarity, or ELA, and the Nationalist Workers’ Committees, or LAB. ELA was founded in 1911 as the labor wing of the Basque Nationalist Party, but began embracing socialism in the 1980s as opposition to the royal dictatorship radicalized many Basque nationalists and labor unionists. The LAB was founded in the 70s, and was explicitly socialist from the outset. While both syndicates are socialist and have enthusiastically endorsed our syndicalist regime, both syndicates are also tightly intertwined with the Basque nationalist movement, with the LAB in particular having direct ties to Basque Homeland and Liberty, or ETA, the infamous Basque terrorist organization that was responsible for many political assassinations. ETA retains a mixed legacy in the new Spain, with some abhorring it for its separatism and the collateral casualties caused in their terrorist attacks while others honor it for its decades-long track record of armed struggle against Francoism and monarchism. Regardless of the uneasiness that some in our administration feel towards the sudden and rapid growth of the ELA and LAB, it’s clear that they are the biggest force in the region, with the ELA representing over 40% of Basque workers and LAB representing nearly 30%.

The two biggest syndicates in the region, the ELA and the LAB, have voted to merge to form the simply named Euskal Sindikatua, or Basque Syndicate. In consolidating these two syndicates, the Basque Syndicate now represents nearly 80% of workers in the Basque Country and over 50% of workers in Navarre. While the Intersyndicale Alliance is still in absolute control of the country and the provisional government, there is mounting concern that the consolidation of power in the Basque territories will grant excessive strength to Basque nationalists, which may serve to damage our capacity to enforce our reforms in the region."

The most obvious effect of this is the changing of street names and signage in public spaces to feature both Basque and Spanish, but Euskal Sindikatua has also made clear that it is in the process of devising improved Basque language education systems and other efforts to promote the Basque language. While some in our government find this endeavor worrisome and indicative of a nationalist streak within what is meant to be an internationalist and strictly proletarian state, Euskal Sindikatua’s eager cooperation in the implementation of our socialist economic reforms has eased the apprehensions of most. However, there are still those that remain distrustful of Euskal Sindikatua for other reasons; the two biggest unions within it have had a decades-long history of collaborating with the separatist terrorist organization ETA, or Basque Homeland and Liberty."

Furthermore, this result has made it clear that, despite the transition to socialism, Basque nationalism is here to stay, at least for the foreseeable future. Most controversial of all, however, is that one of Euskal Sindikatua’s new members of parliament is Arnaldo Otegi, a long-time socialist agitator and anti-fascist militant as well as a suspected member or even leader of the Basque separatist terrorist organization ETA. While there is no court-validated proof of Otegi’s involvement with ETA, most do believe that he has played a role in the fraught history of the terrorist organization.

These people claim that they merely want to defend the socialist revolution in the Basque Country, and hold no grievances towards the new socialist government, as syndicalism has achieved the demands of anti-capitalism and Basque self-determination that ETA fought for. While it is true that ETA has taken no actions against the Workers’ Federation, many in our government remain skeptical, believing that allowing ETA members into the ranks of our armed forces could stir disloyalty, and validated reactionary nationalism that stands in the way of our internationalist and proletarian project.

For most ETA members, their crimes do not classify as such, as they were convicted of terrorism against the Francoist state, which is recognized by the Workers’ Federation as an act of progressive resistance and thus not a crime. While any members of ETA convicted of killing civilians will be barred from participation in the Community Defense Syndicate, those convicted of killing fascist politicians or police officers are considered innocent, and thus must be allowed to participate in the armed forces. While many celebrate that these experienced militants and proven anti-fascists are being allowed to join the military and protect their communities, there are still many who decry the admission of those they perceive as nationalist thugs and murderers into such positions.

spain.388.d:0 "This morning, lawyers representing ETA, or Basque Homeland and Liberty, filed a formal request for amnesty for the organization’s members. This follows in the wake of our recent efforts to try separatist organizations for threatening the unity of our new socialist state. However, ETA’s lawyers have argued that ETA never rebelled against the socialist state, and instead was always in favor of such an entity. ETA, as a matter of fact, only fought against the royalist and fascist states, and they were overthrown before they ever had an opportunity to pursue unity with our government. Technically speaking, we have always considered this form of political violence to be an act of justified violence rather than terrorism, and so there is legal ground for ETA’s members to be pardoned. However, they do have a history of incurring civilian casualties in their efforts to defeat fascism, and there are many who would rather see them imprisoned for these deaths and injuries. Furthermore, ETA represents a nationalist current that our internationalist state is seeking to abolish. With all this being considered, what is to be done with this pack of militants?"

spain.389.d1:0 "As more and more Basque workplaces unionize and join larger syndicates amidst the region’s integration, the balance of power in the Basque Country has proven to be quite divergent from the rest of Spain. Throughout Spain, the provinces have a varying balance of power between the UGT, CNT, CCOO, and USO, but in the Basque Country all four of the mainstream syndicates are dwarfed by the local Basque Workers Solidarity, or ELA, and the Nationalist Workers’ Committees, or LAB. ELA was founded in 1911 as the labor wing of the Basque Nationalist Party, but began embracing socialism in the 1980s as opposition to the royal dictatorship radicalized many Basque nationalists and labor unionists. The LAB was founded in the 70s, and was explicitly socialist from the outset. While both syndicates are socialist and have enthusiastically endorsed our syndicalist regime, both syndicates are also tightly intertwined with the Basque nationalist movement, with the LAB in particular having direct ties to Basque Homeland and Liberty, or ETA. Despite our decision to pardon ETA’s militants, the organization retains a mixed legacy in the new Spain. Regardless of the uneasiness that some in our administration feel towards the sudden and rapid growth of the ELA and LAB, it’s clear that they are the biggest force in the region, with the ELA representing over 40% of Basque workers and LAB representing nearly 30%. The only option left is to welcome these newly empowered syndicates."

Dominated by Basque nationalists, Euskal Sindikatua has already begun using its authority in the region to elevate the Basque language - which is only spoken by around half of the region’s populace - to places of prominence. The most obvious effect of this is the changing of street names and signage in public spaces to feature both Basque and Spanish, but Euskal Sindikatua has also made clear that it is in the process of devising improved Basque language education systems and other efforts to promote the Basque language. While some in our government find this endeavor worrisome and indicative of a nationalist streak within what is meant to be an internationalist and strictly proletarian state, Euskal Sindikatua’s eager cooperation in the implementation of our socialist economic reforms has eased the apprehensions of most. However, there are still those that remain distrustful of Euskal Sindikatua due to its constituent organizations’ long-standing ties to separatist militant groups."

While Euskal Sindikatua hasn’t won enough seats to dislodge or seriously threaten the larger syndicates, which are not geographically concentrated like Euskal Sindikatua is, this result has brought new voices into government that could prove critical in the passing or failing of bills during times of heated debate between the other syndicates in parliament. Furthermore, this result has made it clear that, despite the transition to socialism, Basque nationalism is here to stay, at least for the foreseeable future. Most controversial of all, however, is that one of Euskal Sindikatua’s new members of parliament is Arnaldo Otegi, the de-facto leader of ETA’s short-lived governance of the independent Basque Republic. While he never raised a weapon against the Workers’ Federation, the entrance of the deposed leader of a separatist state has been extremely controversial, sparking uproar and argument in parliament on his first day in office. While the worst of it seems to be behind us, a noticeable tension has settled in the hearts of those in parliament who see ETA as a group of reactionary nationalist thugs."

Further, they argue, ETA never raised arms against the Workers' Federation, and, as such, only ETA members guilty of intentionally killing civilians should be prosecuted. This issue is certain to make its way back to the courts, and ES has made clear its intent for Arnaldo Otegi - the lawyer and ETA leader who briefly served as the head of ETA's short-lived government in the independent Basque Republic - to represent their cause in court."

Under immense pressure from those opposed to ETA in both government and in the general public, the courts have ruled to deny amnesty to ETA militants. While ETA never fought against the Workers’ Federation, the organization still has a long track record of separatism that has historically superseded the group’s socialist advocacy, making it a dangerous group and a threat to the security and unity of the Workers’ Federation. Furthermore, throughout its decades of existence, ETA has been culpable in the deaths of hundreds of innocent civilians and the injuries of thousands more. The courts also mentioned in their decision-making process the cases of ETA cells murdering people who attempted to leave the organization, which they condemned as a crime even in the most dire of circumstances. With this decision finalized, there will be no change to the legal status of ETA and its members. Arnaldo Otegi, who presented ETA’s case before the courts, will return to imprisonment, and all other members of the organization currently imprisoned will be made to serve the remainder of their sentences. While representatives from Euskal Sindikatua, the syndicate which brought this case to the courts, have condemned this decision, it seems that there is nothing left for them to do in this matter."

Following the ascension of Arnaldo Otegi, the lawyer and ETA militant who briefly led the independent Basque Republic, to the Intersyndical Parliament, the Basque federation of the Community Defense Syndicate has seen a major influx of applications, with a startling number of them coming from citizens either accused or convicted of belonging to ETA. These people claim that they merely want to defend the socialist revolution in the Basque Country, and hold no grievances towards the new socialist government, as syndicalism has achieved the demands of anti-capitalism and Basque self-determination that ETA fought for. While it is true that ETA has taken no actions against the Workers’ Federation, many in our government remain skeptical, believing that allowing ETA members into the ranks of our armed forces could stir disloyalty, and validate reactionary nationalism that stands in the way of our internationalist and proletarian project. However, because we issued a pardon to these people, there is legally nothing that we can do to prevent them from joining  our armed forces."

Ultimately, the courts have sided with Euskal Sindikatua’s arguments, which were presented by Arnaldo Otegi, the lawyer and former president of ETA’s government in the independent Basque Republic. For Otegi and hundreds of others, today’s court ruling has expunged their status as convicted separatists. While there are still some ETA members who will remain in prison for their role in causing inexcusable civilian casualties, the bulk of ETA’s leadership and membership will now walk free. Perhaps surprisingly to some, this ruling has coincided with a massive increase in applications to join the Community Defense Syndicate in the Basque Country. No longer threatened with imprisonment or burdened by a criminal record, it seems that many former ETA militants are eager to join the armed forces. Whether that’s in order to ensure Basque control of the Basque Country or because they genuinely wish to defend our socialist revolution remains to be seen. But nevertheless, ETA leaders are expected to quickly rise through the ranks of our military."

The proposed deal, which emphasizes shared socialist ideals and economic solidarity, has raised both interest and skepticism within our leadership. On one hand, engaging in increased trade with Spain offers significant potential benefits, including the strengthening of economic stability and the creation of new avenues for mutual development. The ideological parallels between our model of socialism and Spain’s unique Carlist-socialist hybrid make the proposal seem appealing, suggesting a partnership rooted in similar visions of workers' empowerment and decentralized governance. However, skepticism persists due to the Spanish monarchy’s involvement. Despite King Carlos Javier I’s efforts to transform Spain into a socialist state, many within the Yugoslav political sphere remain wary of aligning too closely with a nation that continues to uphold monarchical traditions. For staunch socialists, Spain’s adherence to monarchy is seen as an anachronism, a contradiction that could undermine the purity of socialist principles and draw criticism from hardline factions."

However, while this partnership cements our role as a major player within the sphere of socialist states, the ideological question remains a topic of contention. Yugoslav leaders have continued to voice their cautious optimism, balancing the benefits of this partnership with an awareness of our odd monarchical framework.

While Carlos Javier has championed a unique blend of Titoist policies and monarchical governance, touting workplace democracy and market socialism, the Yugoslav regime remains steadfast in its belief that true socialism cannot coexist with royal rule.

spain_diplo.13.d:0 "In an expected turn, Francisco Frutos of Spain has issued a stern demand for our annexation, proclaiming that either the people of Galicia submit to his will or suffer the consequences. Such a demand has come as a shock to many within our government as the aggressive demand marks a radical departure from the long-standing position of the Communist Party of Spain, which had once believed in the self-determination of all peoples. The justification provided by Frutos emphasizes the need for the eradication of divisive nationalist sentiments, which he frames as antithetical to proletarian internationalism. By depicting the push for Galician sovereignty as a relic of bourgeois and reactionary forces, the PCE is seeking to consolidate power and reinforce its interpretation of socialism as a system devoid of nationalist fragmentation. While there can be no doubt that millions across our nation have hoped to avoid the onset of war, praying that a last-minute bout of negotiations can avoid the onslaught of the Spanish military through our streets and in our skies, it seems as though there is no room for negotiations. With our independence hard fought for, we can surely not hand our nation over to Frutos without resistance, but for the sake of our people and the hope that Frutos will allow us to maintain a degree of autonomy, maybe we should."

Already key elements of the Basque’s political landscape are being reshaped with ruthless efficiency. The BNG, and similar revisionist cells are now being forcibly destroyed through a ruthless purge of all known affiliates, with the various socialist parties now being forced to bend the knee and accept the dominance of the PCE over their administration. Those who refuse this dominance are now facing imprisonment, exile, or worse, as General Secretary Frutos seeks to eliminate any vestiges of regionalist sentiment that could challenge the authority of his regime.

Citing the nation's independence as a product of Spanish political instability rather than genuine self-determination, the Spanish government insists that our ties to Europe and status as a nation have and will only continue to weaken under the illusion of our sovereignty. While it cannot be denied that the transition to independence has been hard on the economy, with secession proving to significantly have impacted our trade internationally, with nations now weary of using our ports, the African community has been more than welcoming to our independence with like-minded states supporting our development economically and militarily. United with our African brothers and sisters, we may be able to resist the European hordes and finally secure our independence, however, many more believe it may be simpler to return to an era of guaranteed stability under Madrid than gamble everything in a war we may not win."

Yet despite the full support of the government in this matter, the threat of war has terrorized the public and the military staff, with many believing that we are still unprepared for war.

The central government, led by the market liberal and Spanish nationalist party Popular Union, argues that streamlining governance in this manner would enhance efficiency and foster national unity. However, critics argue that such a move threatens the cultural and linguistic diversity within the country, sparking fears of discontent and resistance among the autonomous communities. As the debate intensifies, our government and those of our fellow communities are confronted with a dilemma - either acquiesce to the central government's demands or face the prospect of rebellion. The outcome of this power struggle could have far-reaching consequences, impacting Spain's political landscape and potentially reshaping the relationship between the central government and its autonomous regions.

With this in mind, and with the community’s armed forces and military police now having been seen mobilizing to their borders, Madrid has been left with little choice but to demand the immediate reintegration back into Spain proper. While these demands have been wholly rejected, as expected, there has been growing support for the restoration of stability in the region with many having appreciated the initial attempts at dialogue with these secessionists. As tensions continue to mount with small skirmishes between the police and civil guards along the border, the writing is on the wall; violence is coming and all that it needs is a spark- or an order by Madrid for the armed forces to begin its march to reclaim our territory."

Already, in Lisbon,  leaders and citizens alike feel the tension building. Many wonder: can our independence withstand this looming threat? Adopting Spain’s system, one that contradicts Portugal’s deeply held values, would mean becoming little more than a puppet, with Madrid pulling the strings. There is fear, too, that capitulating would be a betrayal of everything Portugal stands for, erasing hard-won freedoms in return for a dream of a united Iberia that we do not wish to follow. Across the nation, Portuguese voices have risen in resistance, some calling on Lisbon to appeal for international support while others urge us to look to our strength and solidarity.

Under this policy, Portuguese nobles shall retain their lands, titles, and privileges, joining the ranks of Spain’s nobility as equal partners in the new Iberian order. As monarchists on both sides celebrate this historic merger of their aristocratic traditions, the policy has spurred further cooperation from Portuguese landowners, administrators, and regional influencers. The alignment of noble interests marks a critical step in consolidating monarchist support across the peninsula, strengthening the foundations of a united Iberian state.

Supporters of the proposal argue that the exchange could benefit Portugal’s workforce by providing access to advanced Spanish manufacturing sectors and expertise in specific trades. This could help boost wages, attract foreign investment, and create a stronger, more diversified Portuguese economy while reinforcing Iberian unity. However, critics worry that the exchange program could inadvertently strengthen Spain’s influence over Portugal, potentially impacting our national sovereignty and creating dependencies on the Spanish economy. There is also concern that an influx of Spanish workers might undercut local wages or disrupt established employment patterns.

The initial phase is expected to launch soon, marking an important step toward an economically unified Iberia.

However, despite this rejection, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Labor have already emphasized that while the refusal is disappointing, it does not preclude future cooperation between the two nations on a number of policies, and nor will it lead to the continued decline of the Spanish economy. Efforts will continue to foster collaboration in other domains, such as trade and infrastructure development, which could eventually lead to broader agreements on labor mobility.

However, the question remains: can such assurances truly safeguard Portuguese sovereignty? Though Spain’s offer includes significant representation for Portuguese officials and pledges to protect cultural and regional rights, many within Portugal are wary. Critics argue that while political positions and citizenship rights offer initial protections, integration could gradually erode Portugal’s unique cultural heritage and historical independence. As public debate intensifies, the question looms large: should we forge a new future in union with Spain, or preserve our sovereignty and national identity? A decision will shape the course of the Iberian Peninsula, and perhaps even Europe, for generations to come must now be answered with a simple question now being posed to the entirely of our nation- do you wish to unite with Spain, establishing an Iberian Union, under the stipulation proposed by Madrid, or maintain our independence."

This addition to the Spanish proposal, while we agree that such a union would bring shared prosperity and security, strengthening Iberia’s position on the European and world stages, has now left many confused over whether or not to accept such a proposal. Many have already questioned whether the promised autonomy will truly be respected, or whether this confederation gradually eroded our independence, turning us into little more than a Spanish province. Regardless, the government has at least accepted the necessity of posing this question to the people of Portugal because the proposition has already passed through the legislature.

spain_diplo.79.d:0 "Following significant diplomatic overtures to Lisbon, Portugal has formally signed onto the Iberian Mutual Defense Pact, joining us and our former territories in an unprecedented commitment to collective security. This agreement ensures that any threat to one member will be met with the united strength of all, solidifying a regional alliance unseen since the age of Iberian empires. For Portugal, this marks a calculated step toward safeguarding its sovereignty while fostering cooperation among its Iberian neighbors. Government officials have emphasized that the pact represents a partnership of equals, not a return to Spanish domination. By standing alongside Spain and the breakaway states, Portugal positions itself as a crucial player in maintaining stability across the peninsula. Despite some domestic skepticism, the decision has sparked optimism about Iberia’s future. Proponents highlight how shared defense will allow members to focus on economic growth and regional development, knowing they are protected against external aggression. Others see the pact as the foundation for deeper collaboration, one that could redefine Iberia's role on the global stage. With this unity, our neighbors present a strong front, proving that despite their differences, they can work together for the common good."

spain_diplo.80.d:0 "Despite significant political overtures to our Iberian neighbor, Portugal has declined our invitation to join the Iberian Mutual Defense Pact, citing concerns over the balance of power within the proposed alliance. Portuguese officials argue that the pact, though outwardly cooperative, prioritizes Spanish defense interests and risks shifting the region's focus toward Madrid's geopolitical ambitions. This refusal is a significant setback for the dream of a unified Iberian front against external threats. [ROOT.GetLeader]’s efforts to ally mutual respect and collective security across the peninsula now face skepticism from its closest historical neighbor. For Portugal, maintaining autonomy in its defense strategy appears to outweigh the potential benefits of shared protection. In Madrid, the decision has sparked frustration and disappointment. Government officials assert that the pact was intended to strengthen Iberia as a whole, not to reestablish Spanish dominance. The rejection, however, underscores lingering mistrust and differing visions for the region’s future. While this marks a stumbling block for Iberian unity, it is not the end of our ambitions to foster collaboration, the door shall remain open to Lisbon should they ever wish to change their mind and side with us in the defense of Iberia."

The discussions, held in an atmosphere of solidarity, emphasize mutual goals such as economic development, technological exchange, and strengthened diplomatic ties in the Mediterranean. Throughout the meetings, our ambassadors, as instructed by [ROOT.GetLeader] highlighted the historical and cultural connections between our nations, stressing the importance of unity in fostering socialist values across borders. Proposals include coordinated infrastructure projects, shared industrial ventures, and joint educational initiatives to support the growth of both nations' working classes. Algerian leaders, while intrigued by the possibilities, remain cautious about the scale of integration. With recent political and economic transformations of their own, they see this partnership as an opportunity to solidify their standing on the global stage without compromising sovereignty. Yet despite this caution, it appears as though the meeting was largely a success, with the Algerian delegates accepting our proposals for an initial restructuring of diplomatic relations, hoping to continue this healthy cooperation well into the future."

The Spanish delegation framed this partnership as an opportunity to consolidate ideological unity against external capitalist pressures. Among the proposals were joint industrial projects, educational initiatives, and shared investments in infrastructure, steps they argued could bolster the prosperity of both our nations. For our Republic, the proposal presents an intriguing opportunity. While the economic and developmental benefits are clear, some within the leadership remain wary of Spain’s intentions, concerned about over-dependence or potential political influence. Algeria has long fought for its sovereignty and independence and will weigh carefully any agreement to ensure it aligns with national priorities. Yet despite these concerns from some within our foreign office, the meetings themselves have done quite well, with there being little opposition to the notion of continuing our discussions with Madrid as they continue to seek forgiveness for their past."

The Spanish delegation argued that this action would not only liberate the Moroccan people from their oppressive rulers but also secure the Mediterranean as a stronghold of progressive, socialist governance. For [ALG.GetLeader], the proposal carries both opportunity and risk. On the one hand, aligning with Spain in this effort could ensure a close alliance and position Algeria as a decisive force in shaping the region’s future. The fall of a reactionary neighbor might also strengthen socialist movements across North Africa, creating opportunities for cross-border solidarity and economic collaboration under a new Moroccan government. On the other hand, some Algerian leaders express caution. They worry about the ramifications of a military campaign, including potential international backlash, regional instability, and the risk of prolonged conflict. Memories of Algeria's hard-fought independence and the perils of external intervention loom large in the debate. The Spanish offer challenges Algeria to weigh its revolutionary ideals against the practical and moral complexities of such a bold move. Whatever the decision, it will undoubtedly shape the trajectory of both our nations and the balance of power in North Africa for years to come."

Both of our Republics now are united in the continued eradication of reactionary leadership across the Mediterranean, with many more seeing this as a perfect opportunity to ensure the safety of our vision of socialism within our shared region. Preparations for the invasion are already underway. Military coordination is intensifying between Spanish and Algerian forces, with strategies being finalized for a swift and decisive campaign. The operation is expected to involve a two-pronged approach, with Spain leading the western assault while Algeria focuses on the southern front, ensuring that Moroccan defenses are overwhelmed. With the combined might of both socialist nations, the invasion is poised to change the course of North African politics, signaling a new era of socialist cooperation in the region.

Despite initial enthusiasm from both sides about deposing Morocco’s reactionary regime, Algeria has cited the potentially devastating impact on its economy and civilian life as primary concerns for their refusal to partake in the liberation of Rabat. Now, we face a crucial decision: does our commitment to socialist ideals and disdain for the authoritarian Moroccan government warrant an independent military intervention, or should we instead call off the operation, and allow reactionary forces to continue their oppression of the working class? This, naturally, has many within our government divided.  Hardline factions, particularly within the military, argue that this is the perfect opportunity for Spain to assert itself as the leader of North African liberation, urging a full-scale invasion to secure a socialist future for Morocco. Meanwhile, more cautious voices warn that an invasion without the support of Algeria could prove disastrous, both in terms of international relations and the risks of overstretching Spain’s military resources.

spain_diplo.88.d:0 "Following our initial meetings with Spanish ambassadors, Madrid has now returned with an exciting opportunity for our two nations, requesting docking rights in Moroccan ports in exchange for granting the same privileges to Moroccan vessels in Spanish harbors. This deal, Spain argues, would bolster naval defense capabilities for both nations, ensuring greater security in times of conflict, as well as facilitating smoother trade in times of peace. However, despite the evident benefits of this deal, the government has remained deeply wary. The historical baggage of Spain’s occupation of Ceuta and Melilla looms large, casting a shadow over the offer. For many, Spain's past actions and territorial ambitions in North Africa are seen as proof that Spain may one day attempt to assert greater control over Moroccan territory. Despite Spain’s assurances of peaceful cooperation, there is a lingering fear that granting docking rights could serve as the first step toward a more significant Spanish presence in Moroccan waters and ports, one that could ultimately undermine our sovereignty. Though it is unlikely that Spain would ever seek to usurp control of all our ports, the concern remains, and it is a concern that has now ultimately brought a pause to the negotiations."

This deal is expected to foster closer naval cooperation, improve trade routes, and enhance mutual security. Our ambassadors are hailing the agreement as a major success, signaling a new era of cooperation between our countries, particularly after years of tension over territorial disputes such as Ceuta and Melilla. The arrangement is seen as a diplomatic win for us, reinforcing our strategic position in the Mediterranean while also enhancing ties with a key North African neighbor. The deal comes with the promise of reciprocal benefits: improved naval defense capabilities, enhanced trade routes, and greater logistical support in times of conflict.

spain_diplo.90.d:0 "Following the conclusion of our negotiations with Morocco, Rabat has now rejected our offer for docking and basing rights in its ports, despite ongoing discussions aimed at improving cooperation. While the rejection has been framed by Morocco as a decision rooted in sovereignty and national interests, it reflects the enduring complexities of Spanish-Moroccan relations, particularly concerning the controversial territories of Ceuta and Melilla. The refusal to allow us a permanent naval presence on Moroccan soil can therefore, arguably, be seen as a response to concerns over potential encroachment and an unwillingness to compromise on what Morocco views as its territorial integrity. We had hoped that granting basing rights would deepen bilateral ties and signal a shift in the historically fraught relationship between our nations, offering new avenues for collaboration. However, with Morocco’s firm stance against the proposal, we now face the challenge of recalibrating our overtures to Rabat. Leaving us with limited options, while we may continue to seek other forms of cooperation, the rejection of such a significant military and economic offer is undoubtedly a blow to our regional ambitions and may dampen prospects for improved bilateral relations in the short term."

These two cities, though under Spanish control for centuries, have a majority Muslim population with deep cultural and historical ties to Morocco, with Rabat long claiming these cities to be their rightful territory. While the cities’ Spanish identity remains, their strategic and demographic realities render their continued occupation by our forces increasingly untenable in the eyes of our North African neighbors. In the interest of diplomatic pragmatism, we must now consider the realities of the twenty-first century and, perhaps, return the cities to Morocco. However, given the lack of a clear majority for such a decision, and with Morocco admitting they would face significant difficulty with integrating the cities, a compromise has been formed which would transform Ceuta and Melilla into free cities, jointly administered by Spain and Morocco. This approach would allow both nations to benefit economically, preserve some measure of Spanish presence, and alleviate Moroccan territorial concerns. It would also provide a tangible gesture of goodwill that could pave the way for a non-aggression pact, securing both countries against external threats."

In theory, this alliance would open up new markets for Moroccan goods, facilitate investment, and improve trade infrastructure, creating a mutually advantageous relationship. However, the offer is not without its complexities. While Spain’s proposal is appealing on the surface, the historical context cannot be ignored. Given our past experiences with Spanish dominance and territorial disputes, some may view this economic partnership as a way for Spain to subtly reassert influence over our economy. While the financial benefits are clear, there is also the risk of becoming overly dependent on Spain, which could undermine our sovereignty and economic autonomy. Before making a decision, we must weigh the potential economic gains against the political implications of aligning too closely with a former colonial power.

This economic alliance not only strengthens our commercial ties but also paves the way for deeper cooperation between our nations. Morocco’s strategic position in North Africa and its growing economic potential are key assets for us, and this partnership will create new opportunities for investment, infrastructure development, and shared technological progress. While some may have had reservations about deepening ties with Morocco, this pact demonstrates our commitment to mutual prosperity.

This rejection, however, sends a message that Morocco may not yet be ready to fully embrace the benefits of closer economic ties with us. Whether motivated by national pride, political considerations, or concerns over too much dependence on Spanish influence, Morocco’s decision highlights the challenges of establishing stronger partnerships in North Africa. While we respect Morocco’s decision, we will now shift our attention to other opportunities, for now, we must continue to explore economic partnerships with other nations, both within Europe and beyond, and strengthen our position in the Mediterranean and African markets, all the while leaving the door open for an eventual reconsideration by Morocco."

While skepticism lingers on both sides, we have seen this meeting as an opportunity to redefine our northern relationship, not as one of rivalry, but as a partnership built on mutual respect and shared interests. For us, this dialogue is a vital step toward breaking free from the specter of past hostilities.

For us, this represents a strategic dilemma. Agreeing to Spain’s request could deter potential threats to their neutrality, fostering stability in southern Europe and keeping the Iberian Peninsula free from hostile influence. However, such a guarantee comes with the risk of entanglement, as it may oblige us to intervene militarily should Spain be attacked. Spain’s position as a neutral actor offers considerable advantages, particularly in maintaining open trade routes and avoiding a tilt in favor of rival powers.

While the door has been left open to us in the future, this refusal raises questions about our relationship with Moscow and the broader strategic objectives of our government. Despite the considerable advantages membership in the Accords would have provided, including strengthened security and economic ties with a powerful ally, it seems Russia has conjured an objection to our entry as a means to avoid assisting an ally so far from their shores. Now, with this rejection leaving us with few options on the international stage, [ROOT.GetLeader] has positioned the continuation of diplomatic isolation as the perhaps best outcome for our nation, seeing that we will not be tied to the whims of another state. Yet, despite this justification, there remain millions within our borders who continue to dream of an end to our isolation and the day we shall join the globe once more."

While unexpected, this request has presented us with a unique opportunity to secure a stronger foothold for democracy in Europe. This decision, however, is far from straightforward. While Madrid’s inclusion could offer strategic advantages, particularly in counterbalancing authoritarian influences in the region, certain concerns have emerged within our political circles. Critics have highlighted Spain’s unresolved territorial disputes, which risk dragging the League into unwanted conflicts and damaging our continued international image as an alliance based solely on defense. Ascension into the Democratic League has long maintained the original NATO standards, and Spain was aware of this fact when they applied, however, given the continued developments across the globe, which have seen the forces of authoritarianism continue to encroach on all liberty-loving peoples of the world, perhaps an exception can be made. Spain would be more than a reliable partner, and rejecting their entry may alienate a potential ally and leave a critical gap in Europe’s defense of liberty."

As the end of our isolation now dawns over the nation, there has been a moment of pure joy that has spread from each corner of Spain, millions have seen not only our democratic reforms but the end of isolation as confirmation that the days of Francoism have finally ended.

This was supposed to mark the end of our isolation and our ascension to the international community following decades of the lingering spirit of Francoism over our government. Yet, with this refusal, it is clear that Franco continues to sink his teeth into our politics years after his passing. Having cited concerns over our border conflicts with our neighbors and the general instability of the nation, it seems as though even as the forces of authoritarianism continue to encroach on the world, Canada has refused to budge from the original NATO entry requirements.

However, some within our leadership have voiced concerns about the historic contradictions in Spain’s labor record. While Spain has embraced the workers’ cause in recent years, the scars of its treatment of Basque, Catalan, and Galician laborers remain fresh in the minds of international observers. Should Spanish nationalism ever resurface within its government, it is entirely likely the very antithesis of our aims would stand among us leading to the ultimate collapse of our relations. While guarantees have been given by [From.GetLeader] that the new Spain does not seek to undermine the rights of the Iberian working class, nationalism is a difficult disease to treat with it impossible to say for certain whether Spain will commit fully to treatment.

With this acceptance, a new future has finally dawned for us, one that will allow us to pursue new opportunities to align with like-minded nations that share our vision of a proletarian-led future. Likewise, the economic and military support that comes with this partnership will bolster our ability to defend our sovereignty and advance the cause of socialism, both at home and abroad.

Citing lingering concerns over our historical treatment of regional and working-class populations, particularly in Basque, Catalan, and Galician communities, the [NEA.GetName] has seemingly accused us of maintaining lingering nationalist sentiment- a disease we supposedly must rid ourselves of before we can truly claim to be socialists. Despite the evident hypocrisy of their statements, owing to their continued claimant as a successor of the imperialist United States, it seems there is very little we can do to change their minds with [NEA.GetLeader] seemingly demanding we cleanse ourselves of our past before we consider ourselves as socialists.

Yet, this decision is far from straightforward. Spain’s history of political volatility and its strong streak of national independence have raised concerns about the consistency of its commitment to internationalist principles. If war does arrive, would Madrid’s leaders remain steadfast in their loyalty to the collective defense of socialism, or would they seek to prioritize their sovereignty in ways that fracture the unity of the Warsaw Pact? While some have dismissed this claim, seeing Spain as a valuable ally in the fight for the international proletariat, can we truly rely on our new partners to uphold our values and defend to the last the working class of Europe from the ever-growing tides of fascism and capitalism?

For centuries, Andorra has served as a symbolic link between France and Spain, but the shifting balance of influence has often tilted southward, especially given the annexation of the region by Spain shortly after the European Spring. However, this proposal comes with layers of complexity.

Despite the potential benefits for both nations, including modernization of factories and increased output, France has chosen not to pursue this avenue of cooperation. Their refusal raises questions about the broader state of Franco-Spanish relations. While we sought to establish a mutually beneficial partnership to boost competitiveness and economic growth across the region, it appears France remains hesitant to tie its industrial progress to ours. This decision could stem from lingering mistrust, differing strategic priorities, or concerns over the balance of influence in such an agreement. However, regardless of what their reasoning is, their rejection has been a painful one for us to stomach. For us, this rejection is a reminder of the challenges in bridging historical divides. Nonetheless, our resolve remains firm, our industries will continue to modernize through other partnerships and domestic initiatives. While this door may be closed, we remain open to future opportunities for collaboration."

spain_diplo.136.d:0 "In a daring proposal, Spain has now approached us with a proposal to rekindle an old idea, assistance in developing their nuclear program. This echoes discussions from decades past, when the governments of de Gaulle and Franco considered collaboration in this arena. The geopolitical landscape has since changed, but Spain’s ambitions remain a delicate subject. While their request emphasizes civilian nuclear energy and regional stability, we cannot ignore the strategic implications. A nuclear-capable Spain, even under civilian pretexts, could shift the balance of power in Europe and raise concerns among our allies. At the same time, supporting their program could strengthen our bolstering friendship and ensure that under our guidance the Spanish would stick to their commitment of developing purely civilian nuclear technology. Yet, even this course of action holds significant risk.  Assisting Spain might draw criticism from other nations wary of nuclear proliferation. Furthermore, we must consider whether Spain, a nation that has remained isolated since the late eighties, is a nation that should even be granted access to our nuclear programs secrets."

spain_diplo.137.d:0 "In a historic breakthrough, France has agreed to assist us in advancing our nuclear technology. This partnership marks a significant step in our pursuit to secure energy independence and strengthen its regional standing. While officially framed as a program for civilian purposes, the strategic implications cannot be overlooked. Access to French expertise and resources will expedite the development of our nuclear capabilities, positioning us as a modern leader in energy innovation. The agreement also symbolizes a thawing of past tensions and a shared vision for technological progress between our two nations. However, this collaboration is not without its challenges. International scrutiny may intensify, and questions about our long-term intentions could arise, especially given the fact that many within the military are already eyeing the possibility of developing nuclear weapons, a belief that has been shared by some within our government. While any civilian, or potential military, use of nuclear power is still many months if not years away from implementation, the acceptance of this deal by France has ensured that we are now taking the first steps toward reliable, safe, and near-unlimited power."

spain_diplo.138.d:0 "Following intense negotiations, France has formally rejected our proposal for collaboration on nuclear technology, dealing a blow to our aspirations for advancing our energy and scientific sectors. Citing concerns over regional stability and the potential for international backlash, Paris has opted to distance itself from any involvement in our nuclear endeavors. This decision underscores lingering mistrust and hesitation about not only our ambitions but continued European nuclear proliferation, even as we continue to emphasize the peaceful nature of our goals. Without French expertise, the path to developing a robust nuclear program becomes significantly more challenging, leaving us to explore alternative partnerships or a more independent trajectory. While disappointing, this refusal also highlights the need for us to strengthen our domestic scientific and industrial capacity. If other nations are unwilling to support our progress, we must ensure our own innovation fills the void. This setback, though significant, will not deter us from our efforts, in time, we shall seize the atom as our own."

Despite deploying substantial military resources, we have yet to force Madrid into a position of surrender, and Gibraltar remains firmly under Spanish control. While the Rock has long been a strategic asset, allowing us control over the Mediterranean’s western gateway, the war is becoming increasingly costly with little progress to show. Domestic voices are beginning to question whether clinging to Gibraltar is worth the economic and diplomatic toll. At the same time, our commitments elsewhere are also now beginning to suffer due to the continued diversion of resources to the Spanish front. The question now lies before us: should we press on, risking further losses and potential isolation, or pivot our focus toward other priorities, even if that means compromising on Gibraltar? To stand down may bruise national pride, but to persist without clear gains could jeopardize our broader global position."

Meanwhile, our continued occupation of Gibraltar, the prized strategic gateway to the Mediterranean, has sent a clear message of Spanish resilience and capability. Now,  London has extended an offer to formally cede Gibraltar to Spain in exchange for an end to hostilities. This move signals their recognition of our position of strength and the futility of further resistance. The potential transfer of Gibraltar would mark the continued shift in power in Europe and stand as a testament to our nation’s determination to reclaim what is rightfully ours. However, despite the allure to end this conflict and unite Spain once more, there is a growing belief that the continued British failure on the battlefield has proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that we could win this conflict outright and sail to London to enforce our full demands. While warnings and concerns over a repeat of 1588 are abound among those who believe we should accept the British proposal, why waste the chance to topple our historic rivals presence internationally once and for all."

The Spanish government, entrenched in its demand for sovereignty over Gibraltar, has agreed to a cessation of hostilities on the condition that we proposed to them, that the territory is formally transferred to their control. Although a difficult decision, the costs of continued war, both in resources and in human lives, have proven too great to justify prolonging the struggle. The persistent Spanish occupation of Gibraltar and their effective defense against our countermeasures has demonstrated the futility of regaining the territory through military means. While some in Westminster decry the agreement as a capitulation, others point to the strategic necessity of prioritizing Britain’s broader interests over an isolated outpost. With Gibraltar now under Spanish control, we shall endeavor to first reform our armed forces, and begin to shift our focus to rebuilding our international standing, reinforcing a new global presence, and accepting that after three centuries of control the Rock is no longer ours."

Rather than accepting a cessation of hostilities, the Spanish leadership has made their ambitions clear: they aim to push beyond Gibraltar and bring the fight to the heart of Britain itself. This stunning response has shifted the conflict from a territorial dispute to a direct threat against the home islands. Though the situation is dire, it has galvanized both Parliament and the public, uniting us in the defense of our sovereignty. Already, plans are underway to strengthen coastal defenses, fortify key positions, and rally the fleet to meet this unexpected escalation. Spain’s refusal to accept our offer reveals their ambitions extend far beyond Gibraltar, turning this war into a battle for survival and national pride. We must now rise to the occasion, defending not only our territory but the very essence of what it means to be British."

The Spanish government argues that their newfound commitment to the ideals of socialism and alignment with the Warsaw Pact requires immediate assistance to solidify their revolution and modernize their economy. On the surface, aiding Spain could strengthen the socialist bloc in Western Europe, providing a foothold that could challenge the influence of capitalist nations. However, the economic strains within the Warsaw Pact must also be considered. Resources are already stretched thin among our member states, many of whom require continued investment to maintain their industrial growth and address internal demands. Moreover, Spain’s history of political volatility raises questions about the reliability of this alliance.

In turn, this collaboration further integrates us into the socialist world, strengthening ties with allies who share our vision of a proletarian future.

Without Russian oil, we are now compelled to explore alternative avenues to meet our energy demands.

Critics, however, are more hesitant, pointing to Canada’s finite resources and the risks of investing heavily in a country still navigating its internal political complexities. Some fear that any aid could fail to secure Spain’s allegiance while placing an undue burden on Canadian taxpayers.

The rejection comes as a disappointment for those who saw this as an opportunity to accelerate growth in key sectors such as manufacturing, energy, and infrastructure. Beyond the economic implications, many viewed Canadian involvement as a potential bridge toward deeper ties with the Democratic League, a prospect now cast into uncertainty. Some within our leadership have expressed frustration at Canada’s unwillingness to recognize Spain’s economic potential, particularly as we look to position ourselves as a growing force in Europe. Others argue this refusal is a chance to turn inward, prioritizing domestic solutions and forging new partnerships elsewhere. Critics of our approach believe the request exposed our economic vulnerability, questioning whether reliance on foreign aid is the correct path forward.

Beyond fulfilling the moral obligation of solidarity between socialist nations, Spain’s request opens a crucial window for our influence to extend further into Europe, challenging European-aligned socialism and fostering a more independent, democratic alternative. In practical terms, aiding Spain’s economic development provides us with a foothold to establish stronger ties on the European continent. This cooperation not only enhances Spain’s growth in key industries but solidifies our partnership with a state that increasingly aligns itself with our anti-Soviet vision of socialism. By investing in Spain’s infrastructure, energy, and industrial sectors, we can showcase the strength and appeal of our economic model, one that champions the working class without reliance on authoritarianism. Naturally, some voices caution against overextension, citing domestic priorities and the inherent risks of entanglement in European affairs. Yet the strategic benefits are undeniable.

With this agreement, we can expect an influx of resources, expertise, and investments aimed at modernizing critical sectors of our economy, ranging from heavy industry and infrastructure to energy production and transportation. The Americans, known for their efficient economic planning and innovative approach to industry, are uniquely positioned to help us overcome the developmental hurdles we face. Beyond the tangible benefits, this collaboration strengthens our position on the international stage. By forging closer ties with the American People's Commonwealth, we align ourselves with a powerful ally who shares our commitment to socialism outside the Soviet framework.

The refusal marks a missed opportunity to establish deeper ties with a powerful ally in the international socialist movement. The industrial aid would have provided much-needed expertise, resources, and infrastructure improvements to modernize key sectors of our economy, investments that could have positioned us as a leading example of socialism in Europe. While American motivations remain unclear, speculation abounds.

The proposal has ignited a heated debate among policymakers and economic leaders. Supporters argue that granting Spain access to these technologies would strengthen bilateral ties and secure valuable financial gains, potentially paving the way for broader trade agreements and deeper cooperation between our nations. They highlight that Spain’s willingness to pay reflects recognition of Chile’s growing status as a regional economic leader. However, dissenting voices warn of the potential long-term consequences.

Critics warn that such a move could make our economy increasingly reliant on Spanish interests, potentially eroding national control over critical industries. Some fear that a wave of foreign acquisitions might stifle local entrepreneurship and create a situation where our markets are dictated by Spain's economic priorities rather than our own. The proposal has sparked a heated debate across the political spectrum.

The rejection underscores the delicate balance many Latin American nations face when engaging with foreign investors. While the infusion of our capital could have revitalized key sectors, opponents of the deal argued that such acquisitions risked creating economic dependence and eroding local control over vital industries.

Key industries that once thrived under local ownership are now Spanish-controlled, redirecting a substantial portion of our resources and profits back to Madrid. While our GDP initially saw a boost, the long-term implications are becoming clear: decisions about our nation’s wealth are now being made across the Atlantic. Critics of the original deal warned that reliance on foreign capital could erode our autonomy, and their fears are proving true. Spanish corporations now wield significant influence over our labor markets and export policies, leaving us little room to chart our own economic course. Many of our people are beginning to see this as a modern form of dependence—one that is economic rather than colonial, but no less constraining. Our government now faces mounting pressure to address this imbalance. However, untangling our economy from Spain’s grip is easier said than done, especially as our industries are deeply intertwined with their markets.

Spain’s assistance promises to modernize key sectors of our economy, including infrastructure, manufacturing, and energy production. Spanish experts and engineers are expected to work closely with our own workforce, transferring valuable knowledge and fostering sustainable growth.

Unlike the ideologically rigid structures of the Warsaw Pact or other similar alliances, the International Workers’ Front has positioned itself as a more pragmatic and flexible coalition, where diverse interpretations of socialism can coexist without heavy-handed control from a single power. Spain’s overtures highlight their success in building a union of states that share mutual respect and shared goals, rather than imposing strict ideological conformity. Joining the Front would undoubtedly provide our nation with access to expanded economic opportunities, enhanced security guarantees, and closer cooperation with Spain and its allies. Critics, however, question whether such a move would compromise our independence. While the Spanish model appears more adaptable, skeptics worry about whether joining the Front might still lead to external pressures or subtle interference in our domestic policies. Furthermore, aligning with a European-led bloc may complicate our regional relationships or even attract the ire of other global powers. Yet the opportunity remains tantalizing. Spain’s approach has demonstrated that socialism need not follow a singular path to achieve progress, and their proposal could represent a viable alternative for our nation to engage with the wider world without surrendering our autonomy."

This decision represents a setback in our broader efforts to expand the Front and unify more nations under our vision of a cooperative, socialist world. While their rejection may be seen as a challenge, it also presents an opportunity for reflection on how we approach future alliances. We must remain steadfast in our mission to provide an inclusive alternative to the rising capitalist order and the dominance of the authoritarian socialist order, but we also recognize the importance of respecting the sovereignty and choices of our potential allies. Though this specific partnership has not materialized, our resolve remains unshaken.

While his request for a divine endorsement of his Spanish rule is unsurprising, the latter proposal raises significant concerns. Enrique V has framed his ambitions in a language of divine right, seeking to unite Catholic monarchies under a banner of faith and tradition. Such rhetoric, while appealing to our spiritual mission, poses a precarious challenge. Endorsing his claim to the French throne risks stoking a broader European conflict and entangling the Church in secular disputes that could fracture our already fragile influence. Historically, we have walked a fine line between supporting Catholic monarchies and maintaining neutrality in territorial disputes. To unreservedly support Enrique’s claim could undermine our relationships with France’s Catholic faithful, who may see such a move as a betrayal.

The Pope’s endorsement has emboldened our crusade, casting it as not merely a political or military campaign but a holy mission to preserve Catholic values across Spain and beyond. His Holiness has urged the faithful to stand with us in this righteous endeavor, calling upon the global Church to unite against forces that threaten to destabilize both the temporal and eternal realms. This development is expected to bolster our position on the world stage, attracting support from other Catholic powers and reinforcing our moral authority within Spain.

These voices argue that the Vatican itself has been corrupted, and manipulated by forces aligned with liberalism and socialism, which are enemies of both the Church and our nation.

While Spain frames its involvement as a move toward reconciliation and regional stability, questions linger about its true intentions. Is Madrid seeking to extend its influence in the Maghreb by positioning itself as the benefactor of a fledgling nation? Or is this a veiled attempt to undermine our authority in the region under the guise of international goodwill? Domestically, the idea of ceding any ground on the issue of Western Sahara is highly contentious. The region remains integral to our national identity, and its vast natural resources are a cornerstone of our economy. Spain’s proposal, though accompanied by promises of economic aid and political support, risks inflaming nationalist sentiments and alienating key political stakeholders within our borders.

Still, another option is emerging: a referendum that would allow the people of Western Sahara to choose their destiny, whether as an independent state or as part of Spain under a new autonomous framework.

They argue that an overt campaign could risk being seen as meddlesome or coercive, undermining the legitimacy of the referendum itself, and stating that if Sahrawi is to become part of Spain, it must be by their own will, not through heavy-handed persuasion."

Government officials from Madrid have poured resources into Sahrawi, emphasizing the potential economic and political benefits of becoming an integral part of Spain. Roads and schools have been built at record speed, while banners promoting unification adorn major cities across the region. The campaign has been marked by a noticeable shift in tone, with advertisements and public demonstrations presenting a unified Spain as the solution to Sahrawi’s historical challenges. Public infrastructure projects, heavily publicized by Spanish media, are being showcased as evidence of Madrid’s commitment to Sahrawi’s development. This strategy has drawn sharp contrasts between visions of independence and integration. As the referendum nears, Spanish efforts have focused on presenting integration as the more stable and prosperous option. The heavy campaigning has created a palpable atmosphere of tension in Sahrawi, as the region prepares to decide its fate."

Streets once filled with debates, banners, and campaign fervor now host long lines of voters, each person carrying the weight of a monumental choice: to unify with Spain as a fully integrated region or to pursue true independence. The air is electric with anticipation, as polling stations report record turnout. For months, the question of identity and sovereignty has dominated every corner of Sahrawi society, sparking conversations in homes, markets, and schools. Spanish campaigns touting the benefits of unification have clashed with passionate calls for independence, creating a deeply divided yet engaged electorate. Observers from around the world watch closely, knowing the result will reshape not just Sahrawi but its relationship with Spain and the broader region.

While the vote reflects the will of the Sahrawi people, it remains non-binding, leaving us with the authority to either accept the result or disregard it entirely. This outcome poses a significant challenge to our strategy in the region. Advocates for unification within Madrid argue that rejecting the referendum is essential to safeguard our strategic foothold in North Africa, ensuring stability and continued access to vital resources. Others warn that overriding the referendum could undermine our international credibility and spark unrest among the Sahrawi population, further complicating relations with neighboring states. The referendum result also casts doubt on the effectiveness of our recent investments and pro-unification campaign, which many had hoped would sway public opinion in favor of integration. Instead, the outcome highlights a persistent divide between Sahrawi aspirations and Madrid’s ambitions. As the government deliberates, it must weigh the potential fallout of disregarding the vote against the long-term implications of relinquishing its influence in the region."

Plans are already underway to accelerate the process of incorporating Sahrawi into our administrative and economic framework, with promises of significant investment to raise living standards and fully integrate the region into the national fabric. However, the outcome has not been without its critics. Detractors within our borders have condemned the move as a modern iteration of imperialism, accusing the government of exploiting Sahrawi’s economic vulnerabilities to secure a foothold in Africa. Activists and opposition parties have expressed concern over the ethical implications of the campaign for unification, calling into question the fairness of the referendum process. Regardless of what these people may think, democracy has triumphed and Sahrawi shall now prosper as a region under our rule."

Prime Minister Jeremy Corbyn has introduced the Intervention in Spain Bill, seeking parliamentary approval to involve Britain in the escalating conflict through material aid and possibly direct military action. The proposed intervention, framed as a moral imperative to support democratic forces against authoritarianism, has sharply divided opinions within Westminster. With the Independent Labour Party holding a parliamentary majority, many anticipate the bill’s passage. However, the ILP itself remains deeply fractured. A significant faction of MPs, wary of embroiling Britain in foreign entanglements, argues that intervention risks unnecessary loss of life and economic strain. Meanwhile, opposition parties, particularly the Conservatives and Social Democrats, have found a rare point of unity in opposing the measure, criticizing it as an ideological gamble that could drag Britain into another European quagmire. As parliamentary debate begins, all eyes are on the ILP’s internal divisions. Should a coalition of intervention skeptics emerge, Corbyn’s government could face a significant political defeat."

A shipment of British military equipment, ranging from small arms to heavy artillery, has already arrived, with further shipments expected in the coming weeks.The aid marks a major shift in Britain’s foreign policy, with Corbyn’s administration bypassing traditional reluctance to engage in European conflicts. The delivery provides a much-needed boost to our Republican forces, who are battling the Francoist menace across the nation. In addition to the equipment, reports suggest that British volunteers are preparing to join the fight, further strengthening our resolve. With our frontlines now fully replenished, the grand advance against fascism can now begin. While many had previously believed that the war for the liberation of our country was a never-ending conflict that would last as long, if not longer, than the war of 1936 the support granted to us by Britain has now assured millions that Spain will not suffer as it did in the past. With artillery shells now raining down on Francoist positions and our tanks spearheading toward Madrid, the time will soon come for our freedom, the fall of fascism in Europe, and the liberation of the Spanish worker."

These regions, having played pivotal roles in recent upheavals, now stand at a crossroads alongside the rest of the nation. With the situation already volatile in these areas, Madrid is now faced with the decision of whether to fully integrate these territories into Spain proper, treating them as equal parts of a unified state, or to recognize them as semi-autonomous members in the Confederal system.  Advocates of integration argue that a singular national identity is necessary to prevent further fragmentation, asserting that Spain’s survival depends on its unity. Integration would also ensure streamlined governance and equal treatment of all regions under a singular legal framework. On the other hand, proponents of a confederal model emphasize the cultural, linguistic, and historical distinctiveness of these regions. Autonomy, they argue, could provide a path to reconciliation, granting these regions a measure of self-determination while preserving the integrity of the state. Such a move, however, raises concerns about setting precedents for further demands for independence. Public opinion is deeply divided, with nationalist factions pushing for unification and regional leaders lobbying for self-governance. The outcome of this debate could shape the course of our political future, determining whether we emerge from our recent turmoil as a centralized state or a mosaic of semi-autonomous regions bound by a fragile union."

This influx of funding is set to support key industries, enhance infrastructure, and create new employment opportunities. Local leaders have cautiously welcomed this decision, noting that economic disparities between regions have long been a point of contention. The move is seen by some as a step toward mending historical grievances and ensuring a more balanced distribution of resources across the nation. Critics, however, argue that these investments may come with strings attached, potentially undermining our autonomy by increasing reliance on Madrid’s oversight. Questions also linger about whether this funding will adequately address the unique needs of our community or simply align with the central government’s broader economic agenda. Despite these concerns, many residents express optimism about the opportunities this initiative might bring.

While this would not be an issue normally, with some within our ranks encouraging the Spanish to continue their course of action, these autonomous communities have also found themselves as our close allies with these regions even being members of our alliance. As Spain’s allies, we must now grapple with a pivotal decision: do we stand by our nationalist ally in their campaign for unity, or do we support the autonomous regions in their fight for self-determination? Backing Madrid would reinforce our commitment to a strong and centralized Spanish state, aligning with broader strategic interests. However, such a move risks alienating populations within Spain and the wider international community, who may view this campaign as an act of internal imperialism. On the other hand, supporting the autonomous communities could uphold the principle of regional sovereignty but at the cost of our relationship with the nationalist government.

This decision shatters the trust that once bound us to our supposed allies. Rather than upholding the principles of self-determination, they have chosen expediency, bolstering Spain’s campaign against us for their own strategic benefit. We now stand isolated, with no support from the international allies we once believed would stand by our side. As Spanish forces mobilize, the path ahead is treacherous.

With foreign intervention now a certainty, the stakes have escalated beyond a domestic issue. What began as an internal consolidation of power has spiraled into a confrontation that threatens to pit us against the very faction we had counted on for support. As the eyes of the world now once more turn to Iberia, the upcoming battle will be one where we prove beyond a shadow of all doubt that the Spanish military is a force to be reckoned with, one that has advanced long beyond the troubles of the Francoist era, and one that will unite Iberia under the banner of Madrid."

Despite being something of a pariah state, the dictatorship is the internationally recognized government of Spain, and so we have grounds to defend our intervention in the conflict. That said, intervention will surely increase tensions with the socialist powers of the world. Despite our ideological hatred towards them, our economies are fundamentally tied to theirs due to their strength in the world. Further, our military resources are already dwarfed by those of the socialist bloc, and an expenditure such as this may be too costly or worse, risk military retaliation from the communists. However, there is brewing discontent amongst the populaces of Europe’s communist states; they may be too distracted dealing with their own issues to retaliate against us in any meaningful way if we involve ourselves in Spain.

Technically speaking, this war is an insurrection against an internationally recognized government, and, while the Spanish regime is something of a pariah in the global community, intervening on behalf of these rebels may provoke the ire of more conservative governments, who see us as exporting socialist revolution. The socialists currently in charge of the Provisional Republic have repeatedly affirmed their commitment to creating a liberal democracy, but our involvement could very well be seen as an attempt to expand our influence, much as Comintern intervention in the Spanish Civil War of 1936 was perceived by the world’s liberals and conservatives as a ploy to create a Soviet satellite state. Additionally, our country faces its own slate of internal issues at the moment, and it may prove unwise to overly commit our armed forces to foreign adventures.

spain_elections.1.d:0 "Having suffered a disastrous electoral defeat at the recent general election, Pablo Iglesias has announced his intention to step aside as leader of the United Labor Party in the hopes that his successor will find more fortune with the electorate. While many had anticipated a lengthy process in which multiple candidates had their voices heard before a final run-off between the two most supported candidates was placed before the party membership, instead, the United Labor Party has opted to rally around the leadership of Juan Carlos Mondero, a young firebrand and relatively new face within the Cortes. As Iglesias’ designated successor, his election has not come as a surprise to any within the party, however, his seeming coronation as party leader has done little to gain him favor among the same party moderates that his predecessor had failed to court, with many still calling for a free and fair election so that all voices in the party may be heard. While a man similar to Iglesias in politics, the younger leader is no stranger to politics, having served within the previously underground socialist movement since 2000, where, much to the disappointment of party moderates, he spent time in Venezuela, learning from Hugo Chávez’s advisors. While it is unknown whether this controversy shall affect the new leader, one thing is for certain, the United Labor Party now stands at a crossroads with Monedero’s leadership either proving to be what is needed to see the workers of Spain return to power or be consigned to the history books."

Despite expectations for an internal election to determine her successor, the party has instead chosen to coronate José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero as the new leader, bypassing a contest that many moderates had hoped for. Zapatero, a veteran politician and prominent figure in the underground opposition to Franco, brings a legacy of anti-fascist credentials that could invigorate the party’s core voter base. His history of leadership and his role in Spain’s post-dictatorship political landscape are seen as assets in reuniting the party's leftist factions. However, this top-down decision has drawn criticism from more moderate factions within the party, who had pushed for a more democratic selection process. While Zapatero’s return may rally the party’s progressive wing, his task is formidable. He faces the challenge of reconsolidating the divided socialist camp and crafting a strategy to regain the public’s trust and lead the Workers' Party to a majority in the Cortes. As Zapatero assumes leadership, his ability to navigate the internal tensions within the party and counterbalance Spain’s shifting political landscape will determine whether his tenure can restore the party’s influence or deepen its divisions."

Despite initial hopes for an internal election, the party, in a move to preserve unity and avoid prolonged debate, has chosen to coronate Luis Garicano Gabilondo as Rivera's successor. Garicano, who has secured the backing of Rivera and other senior officials within the Cortes, is seen as a continuity figure for the party’s social and economically liberal agenda. However, his appointment as leader has signaled a further shift toward the economic right, with the Popular Union doubling down on its free-market principles, a position that may have proven costly for them at the recent general election. However, even with this shift to the right, Garicano has managed to claw back elements of the internationalist wing of the Popular Union, proclaiming his backing of the Democratic League and Spanish involvement in their efforts to liberate Europe from tyranny. While these positions may resonate well with the Popular Union's core base, Garicano faces the significant challenge of proving himself to a broader electorate. With Spain’s political landscape growing more polarized, it remains to be seen whether he can position himself as a viable contender for Prime Minister.

The move, described by some as a strong-armed internal coup, has been justified by party officials as necessary to preserve the party's future. National Democracy has cited Serrano’s leadership as a failure that tarnished both the movement and its core nationalist values. Despite Serrano's demands for reinstatement, the party refused, and Serrano has since announced his retirement from politics, ending his once-prominent role within Spain’s far-right political scene. Villalba, a self-proclaimed admirer of José Antonio Primo de Rivera, has set a clear direction for the party, vowing to reshape National Democracy into a force capable of serving Spain at any moment, and promising a return to the glory days of Franco’s regime. While his rhetoric has yet to gain widespread appeal among the broader electorate, Villalba's charisma and effective oratory skills have begun to win support among certain factions, positioning him as a growing figure in Spain’s ultra-conservative circles. Whether he can rejuvenate National Democracy remains to be seen, but his rise marks a new chapter for the embattled party."

Yet, the expansion of the Popular Union’s tent has also seemingly been its potential undoing, with National Democracy launching a wave of assaults against the party, claiming its leadership to have been overrun by communists that now seek to destroy the Republic and hand it over to Europe on a silver platter. With the war for the soul of the Republic seemingly on the line, only the people can determine which definition of freedom shall define the next four years."

spain_elections.9.d:0 "Following One Spain’s failure to secure victory in the recent snap elections, Mariano Rajoy has announced his intention to step aside from politics once again, acknowledging that the party’s future now lies with a new and modern leadership figure. Despite vocal objections from within the party, where many urged Rajoy to remain for one final election, he appears to have lost his political zeal seeing no possible way he could lead the party to victory, clearing the way for Deputy Leader Soraya Sáenz de Santamaría to take over without opposition. While Sáenz de Santamaría's policies are largely in line with Rajoy's traditional conservative platform, her public appeal marks a significant shift. Her leadership has already drawn attention, especially among female voters who are intrigued by the possibility of Spain's first female prime minister. Her challenge will be to convert this curiosity into lasting support by demonstrating the strength of her policies and proving why Rajoy entrusted her as his second-in-command. Though One Spain remains on familiar ideological ground, Sáenz de Santamaría’s ability to energize the electorate could be the key to revitalizing the party’s prospects in the wake of Rajoy’s departure. As Spain watches her every move, the stage is set for Sáenz de Santamaría to define the next chapter of the party's future."

spain_elections.10.d:0 "Following the People's Party's defeat in the most recent elections, Santiago Abascal has formally announced that he no longer sees a viable path to electoral victory under his leadership, despite previously insisting that only he could secure such a triumph. In a surprising shift, Pablo Casado Blanco has been selected to take over as the party’s new leader after a brief round of negotiations within the party’s senior ranks. Casado Blanco, a self-described liberal-conservative, is known for his right-leaning positions, shaped heavily by his Christian values. His staunch support for anti-abortion policies and the belief in the secondary role of women in society may stir controversy, particularly within the more centrist sections of the People's Party. However, his firm stance on these issues could also serve to siphon votes from National Democracy, potentially reuniting the fragmented right-wing electorate behind the People's Party. Though Casado Blanco is not yet a widely recognized figure, his leadership could revitalize the party, offering the possibility of a resurgence for the People's Party and creating a new dynamic within Spain’s conservative politics. Whether this will be enough to restore the party’s electoral fortunes remains to be seen, but his leadership will certainly mark a new chapter for the People’s Party."

He has pledged to collaborate closely with his predecessor and engage with all those willing to join him in securing an electoral victory for the United Labor Party in the future. As an immigrant from the Netherlands, Santos stands as the first non-Spanish-born leader of a major political party in Spain. While his leadership has its share of detractors, particularly from the far-right, who claim his non-Spanish birth disqualifies him from running for office, his ascent has also energized the party’s more progressive and internationalist factions. In response to these criticisms, Santos has placed immigration reform at the forefront of his agenda, seeking to return the United Labor Party to its internationalist roots and position it as a champion for inclusivity and solidarity across borders.

Though Sánchez describes himself as a social democrat, his leadership offers a more moderate direction compared to his predecessor, which has led some to suggest that the party's once bold socialist character may be softening. Critics argue that the PSOE, under his guidance, is losing its traditional red tinge in favor of a rose-pink hue, reflecting a gentler brand of socialism. Whether Sánchez’s new direction will resonate with voters and bring electoral success remains to be seen.

As the former Minister of the Interior under Mariano Rajoy, Paniagua has garnered significant support from the party’s base, primarily due to his straightforward pledge to focus on national security. Framing his leadership around safeguarding Spain from both internal and external threats, Paniagua has effectively positioned himself as the law-and-order candidate for the next electoral cycle, a strategy aimed at reclaiming voters who have drifted away from One Spain. However, despite this clear messaging on security, Paniagua has been vague about his broader political vision. His failure to articulate a concrete platform beyond his law-and-order stance has led many to question his capacity to lead the party to electoral success. Some within the party and political analysts have expressed concerns that his leadership may signal One Spain’s defeat in the next election, especially if he is unable to expand his policy agenda beyond these core talking points. With time left before the next election, the question remains whether Paniagua can develop a more comprehensive policy platform or if his reliance on radical centrist rhetoric will ultimately lead One Spain to falter further.

A controversial figure, Aguirre has made clear her intention to overhaul the party from its grassroots to its senior leadership, breaking with the party’s long-standing traditions of post-fascism, hyper-monarchism, and Christian Democracy. Aguirre has openly expressed admiration for Margaret Thatcher, drawing inspiration from the former British Prime Minister’s tenure. She has even argued that Thatcher’s leadership was unjustly curtailed by men who believed they knew better, suggesting that a similar reformist zeal is needed to reshape the People's Party for the modern era. This admiration for Thatcher’s legacy has, however, provoked tensions within the party, as many question whether Aguirre’s desire to emulate such a controversial and insignificant figure from the twentieth-century is the right path forward. Nonetheless, Aguirre’s rise to leadership marks a clear signal that the People's Party is committed to modernization. With internal reforms already under discussion, her leadership may address the party’s stagnation and its inability to connect with voters in the recent election. While Aguirre's bold vision has stirred both excitement and anxiety within the People's Party, it is evident that the old guard of the party is facing a challenge, and the future of the party may rest on Aguirre's ability to balance modernization with its traditional roots."

In a bold move aimed at reshaping its public image, National Democracy has appointed Ignacio Garriga as its new leader, making him the first black man to head a major political party in Spain. Garriga’s appointment is seen as a significant step toward distancing the party from its previous associations with Francoist-era figures, as he has consciously eschewed such admiration to reposition the party as a viable alternative for modern conservatives. His leadership is characterized by a commitment to the party line, emphasizing traditional values while attempting to broaden its appeal beyond its historical limitations. However, Garriga's elevation to leadership has not silenced critics. Many on the left continue to argue that National Democracy remains inherently resistant to genuine change, positing that the party could never fully empower a man of color to lead. Garriga has vehemently rejected these assertions, denouncing them as racist assumptions that undermine his authority and legitimacy as a leader. Despite Garriga’s efforts to reframe the party’s narrative, skepticism persists about whether this leadership shift will sufficiently address the deeper issues of perception and policy that have long plagued National Democracy. As he attempts to unite conservatives and redefine the party’s identity, the upcoming months will be critical in determining whether this new direction can translate into electoral success and broader societal acceptance."

spain_celections.7.d:0 "With the successful rise of the UGT to power, significant reforms have now been implemented to the Spanish electoral system, with any hope of a liberal multi-party democracy championed by moderates now done away with in favor of a parliamentary system dominated by unions. Now, instead of casting their vote for a tyrant or supposed group of parties that will represent only half of their interests, the people will elect, directly, a union that will shape the future of the Federation over a four-year term. As the architect of this reform, the UGT has now entered the race as the clear favorite to achieve a majority within the Intersyndicale. However, a significant challenge to their election has been put forward by a litany of unions ranging from all walks of life. As the most radical, the CNT has positioned itself as the voice of finalizing the revolution begun by the UGT proclaiming syndicalism to be the first step towards the realization of an anarchist society. However, while the CNT has been the loudest throughout the campaign, their appeal has been significantly dampened by the fact that most citizens of the Federation are uncomfortable with their rhetoric questioning how far their policies would go. As a result, the CCOO has been able to mount a successful counter stating that the policies of syndicalism and anarchism have all but failed across the globe, pointing to the deadlock in the American People’s Commonwealth under President Chomsky as evidence of this reality. Instead of pushing for a more centralized approach to governance, falling in line with the Leninist movements of old, the election of the CCOO would represent the continuation of socialism as envisioned by millions across the globe. Finally, largely the underdog, the USO has also run an admirable campaign calling upon the Catholic majority to support their struggle for representation of the people, hoping to demonstrate that socialism, despite what many believe, can and will work for the religious community."

Hoping to retain their majority, the UGT has now mostly run on a platform of continuance, arguing that the revolution, while having made great strides, has yet to be completed and that only through their guidance can the people of the Federation truly be emancipated. However, much like four years ago the UGT’s position has been challenged. Once more, the CNT has presented a need for an immediate course correction, seeing the system envisioned by the UGT as abandoning the principles of the revolution and upholding a system of government that inherently seeks to weaken the working class. However, this position has been challenged by the CCOO, which has spent much of the last four years continuing to argue for further centralization of power surrounding the ruling union, believing that the state cannot be tied down by petty squabbling between representatives and must elect an official head of state. While a compelling argument for many, it is unlikely that such a change shall be implemented even if the CCOO achieves a majority, owing to the need for a two-thirds majority within the Intersyndicale to adopt such a change. Much like the CCOO, the USO has also begun a fierce campaign to secure their election, attempting to move beyond the failures of the previous campaign and, while clinging to their Catholic roots, establish a broad tent and siphon voters for other unions that have fallen short in properly representing the interests of the working class."

Demanding an end to the failed policies of anarchism, the CCOO has been able to gain significant traction among the populace, who have begun to question how far anarchism can be taken before it ultimately fails. Requesting the immediate strengthening of the Intersyndicale and the leading union, the CCOO now stands poised to restore sense and Marxist orthodoxy to the Federation. However, the USO has also taken part in the denunciation of the CNT beginning a fierce campaign to secure their election, attempting to move beyond the failures of the previous campaign and, while clinging to their catholic roots, establish a broad tent and siphon voters for other unions that have fallen short in properly representing the interests of the working class.

As the main target of this slander, the CNT has hoped to continue to counter the allegations that anarchism cannot work, believing that through their governance and the careful cooperation of similar ideologically aligned unions such as the UGT, anarchism can and will thrive. Yet, this position has been challenged by the CCOO and even the USO, with the latter now positioning itself as a moderate alternative to the former, seeing their chance to rally the traditional catholic voter base to victory, owing to the continued ostracization being committed by the Leninist government's policies towards the Spanish religious community. Working with any union that will give them their ear, the USO has hoped that the reinvigoration of their base, combined with reaching out to disenfranchised CCOO voters, will win them a majority.

While once presumed to be a difficult task, this strategy has been effective at finally establishing a functioning voter base for the USO. However, the UGT has worked hard to end this siphoning of voters, arguing that the USO represents a moderate break from the revolutionary zeal of former President Pepe Álvarez, hoping to convince the workers that moderation will ultimately lead to the ruin of the revolution. Surprisingly, this position has been shared by the CCOO and the CNT as well, albeit for different reasons. The CCOO has argued that moderation will ultimately spell an intrusion of reactionaries into the government, demanding the people see through the USO’s strategy of tempering the unfinished revolution and campaigning on the plan to bring Leninism and the true revolution to Madrid.

No voice has been stronger on the matter than the CNT, who has criticized the UGT for slipping towards authoritarianism and abandoning the revolutionary principles it had once fought for, demanding that all representatives still loyal to the revolution, to anarchy, side with them against the UGT. However, the CCOO has likewise ran a successful campaign of slander towards the UGT decrying it as a group of hypocrites that have now stolen their platform of supporting the revolutionary vanguard, suggesting that if the people desired a true defender of the revolution they would side with them and reject the false pretenders of socialism. While a fierce condemnation, the CCOO has been unable to reach through the masses, with many instead supporting the USO.

Similarly, the USO has likewise denounced the anarchist system, calling into question how viable the current policies of the CNT are in the long term, believing that what is needed now, more than ever, is a return to the policies of the early days of the revolution where there was little debate over whether authoritarian or libertarian socialism works and more emphasis on the common worker. However, while this rhetoric has been well received, the USO’s continued emphasis on catholicism has caused some to reflect on whether their policies will truly work for them.

Leading the charge on this is the UGT, who have argued that the election of the USO has jeopardized the constitution, which has long stated that the working class will be represented by a revolutionary government that shall put their interests first. While the definition of revolution is up for debate, the UGT has argued that the only way for the government to succeed is if the zeal once held by its leadership in the early days of the Federation is restored. This, however, has been questioned by the CNT, who have argued that a revolution must come from the people and not the government, once more trying to put forward the case for an anarchist society where all are equal and the threat of moderation is eradicated.

While not expecting to receive the support he had done, Iglesias’ call to arms ushered in the establishment of the Spanish Provisional Republic and the beginning of a new Spanish Civil War. Now, having believed himself to hold an iron grip over Spain, General Bucher has been forced to accept the reality that the working people of Spain, its middle and upper classes, and even elements of the military have rejected the continued dominance of Francoist policy that has done little more than divide the Kingdom since its consolidation of power in 1939. While General Bucher and his forces believe that such a campaign against the Republican government will be a quick and short-lived campaign, owing to the uprisings armed forces comprising of anti-fascist militias, others have refused to undermine the Republican strength, recognizing that foreign intervention may be inevitable with both the Democratic League and Warsaw Pact eager to support the Republican movement."

While not expecting to receive the support he had done, Iglesias’ call to arms ushered in the establishment of the Spanish Provisional Republic and the expansion of the secessionist wars into the beginning of a broader civil war. Having believed to have held an iron grip over the Kingdom, Felipe has now been forced to accept that the war against the secessionist movements has spiraled out of his immediate control and that the working people of Spain, its middle and upper classes, and even elements of the military have rejected their leadership. What had once been believed to be a quick campaign against a group of rag-tag terrorist cells has now engulfed the entirety of Spain, with none safe from the horrors of war last seen in 1936.

As the Kingdom of Spain now enters a state of mourning for its monarch, the rest of the world, having offered its condolences, has viewed this passing as a moment of opportunity for the isolated monarchy. The soon-to-be Felipe VI has made his desire for reform well-known in the past, and while none are expecting the Kingdom to break away from its authoritarian system, there has been a gradual acceptance that the new King may soon bring his Kingdom out of a near four-decade isolation.

spain_news.8.d:0 "With the near collapse of central authority across the Kingdom of Spain, largely caused by alleged radical socialist elements and independence movements, General Fulgencio Bucher, along with the majority of the armed forces stationed in Madrid have now marched on Zarzuela Palace, forcing Felipe VI into house arrest. Following a relatively peaceful march on the Palace, in which even Felipe’s guard turned against him, General Bucher has now declared an immediate end to the failed policies of the monarchy, pledging to defend Spain from the domestic threats that Felipe had willingly allowed to multiply. While stopping short of ordering Felipe’s abdication, instead opting for house arrest, General Bucher’s actions have now once more cemented power in Spain around its military, effectively neutering the hopes of reforms that many had clung to and restoring the Francoist constitution. Although now the de jure head of the Kingdom, Bucher’s rule is far from secure, with more radical military elements now seeking to utilize the situation to their advantage, it seems as though the instability that had plagued Spain has not been healed merely calmed with Bucher now facing threats from his military and the Spanish working class who seem poised to ignite a general strike in defiance of his coup."

Arriving at the Palace in the early hours of the morning, protestors and agitators were quick to trample through the defensive lines hastily constructed by the Royal Guard. With several of the Royal Guard defecting to the Republican movement, it did not take long before the Palace itself was seized, Felipe VI placed under house arrest, and the flag of the Third Spanish Republic hoisted above the royal palace. While the culmination of a months long struggle organized by the Republican movement and aided by the various independence organization across the now former Kingdom, the speed at which such dramatic change has occurred in Spain has been profound with not even acting Prime Minister Pablo Iglesias having expected such a peaceful revolution to have occurred so suddenly. While such change has been celebrated across the new Spanish Provisional Republic by many, a great deal more have already offered objections to Iglesias’ leadership, demanding that he push for reforms that would see communism finally arrive on Spanish shores."

Declaring themselves to be new independent Republics, the secessionist movements have issued a joint statement saying that the time of inaction is over and that Madrid can either willingly allow the independence of their so-called troublesome regions or face the combined wrath of a people oppressed for centuries by the tyranny of a foreign crown. As expected, such demands were scorned by the crown and the Cortes, who quickly called for immediate military intervention to quell the violent uprising and restore order to the now-divided Kingdom. With the Spanish armed forces now being sent across the Kingdom to restore order, there have begun whispers amongst its high command that should the situation not be contained within an acceptable time frame drastic action may have to be taken to ensure the stability of the Kingdom, with the blame expected to fall at Felipe’s shoes."

As a result, the Provisional Republic has yet to finally settle the age-old divide that has permeated throughout Spain over the last century. Yet, for the time being, it appears that much of Spain, including Prime Minister Iglesias, is eager to avoid the issue and merely celebrate the end of an eighty-year-long dictatorship."

While many have accepted the necessity of an elected head of state, a great deal within the Spanish military has questioned handing power over to such a radical figure, especially one who believes that Franco did not go far enough in his pursuit of power and revolution. Having already promised to turn Spain into the first Falangist state, which Bencomo has as a centralized state that seeks to establish a third position while rejecting the failures of capitalism and socialism, there is an element of uncertainty about the future of Spain.

As the brother of the late Carlos Hugo and, therefore, not the heir to the Carlist line, the coronation of Enrique V has been anything but straightforward. Denouncing the heir apparent, his nephew, Carlos Javier, as an ardent socialist and a tyrant, Enrique has only emerged victorious in the battle for the crown due to his successfully stoking fears of his nephew’s radicalism to members of the military junta and Catholic church. Having found an ally in both, Enrique V has now sworn to protect his nation from the group of subversive radicals that have silently been festering among the populace since the turn of the millennium. While many had hoped that the deposition of Felipe and the restoration of a new claimant to the throne may have been enough to continue the demands for reform across Spain, it seems as though the Carlist dynasty will differ very little from its Bourbon counterparts, with Enrique eager to rule with an iron grip to ensure the safety of his new Kingdom."

Denounced as a socialist and decried as a tyrant, Javier has only emerged victorious in the battle for the crown due to ardent monarchists within the Spanish junta demanding that the line of succession be maintained to avoid further political instability. As such, it seems the new King faces an immediate uphill battle against those who have deemed him a radical and, in the most extreme of cases, an agent of Berlin. Despite these denunciations, Javier has begun to mend the divides within Spanish society, with many seeing his coronation as confirmation of the beginning of reform. While such hopes have been dashed before, Javier has, for much of his life, spoken openly about the need for radical political reform ranging from the implementation of stronger workers' protections to the moderate implementation of decentralization within Spain. While some have deemed these views as antithetical to the rule of an absolute monarch, many more have deemed the King’s hypocritical beliefs as essential if Spain is to enter the twenty-first century."

While many have denounced the actions of the United Left, decrying their actions as inherently undemocratic and a betrayal of the recent revolution, these complaints have largely fallen on deaf ears following the hurried assembly of the new government under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader], who has received the support of most unions, ranging from the Workers' General Union to the National Confederation of Labor.

While not all members of the Spanish government have welcomed this announcement, seeing the adoption of Santiago’s doctrine as a step back into the twentieth-century of communism, the ideological dominance of Santiago’s bloc has assured that there will be no course correction any time soon. As Spain heads towards a new era under socialism, one in which there has been little room for democracy or the rights of man, there remains much to be said for the methods of Madrid’s reforms and whether Eastern Europe will be an effective model to mimic, owing to the growing instability across Europe."

Though much of the Communist Party has questioned the decision to shift towards this Eurocommunist vision, arguing that the political system of these nations differs vastly from the one envisioned by the revolution, the dominance of Centella’s bloc in the Cortes, combined with the support of the people, has ensured that these seemingly democratic reforms will not be reversed any time soon.

This unexpected revival of what is effectively syndicalism has, however, been met with significant challenges from those within Spain’s borders and those across it. With European ambassadors arriving to discuss Suárez’s project, and the United Left denouncing the plan as too ambitious, the only, perhaps required, respite for Suárez has been that the unions, the newly liberated organ of Spain, have been wholeheartedly supportive of the reformation of the Republic.

While not seeking to return to lead the party, the aging revolutionary was forced to as the party he spent decades leading from the underground continued to tear itself apart, only being confirmed as General Secretary of the Communist Party and President of Spain by the seventeenth ballot. While many had hoped that Frutos would return and act as a gentle guiding hand for the party, it appears the new President has been anything but calm, demanding that the party pull itself together before the revolution can be destroyed by internal or external subversive forces. Calling for his constitutional amendments to be implemented immediately for the survival of the Republic, it seems as though this student of Stalin has now set the course for a far more radical revolution than many had hoped for, as the eyes and ears of the state now turn against both the people and the alleged reactionaries within the Communist Party."

With the execution of Felipe taking place in the center of Madrid, the images of watching his wife and daughter's deaths still fresh in his mind, any hope held by the remnants of the monarchist resistance in Spain that the incoming revolution would be one less brutal than its 1917 counterpart have been shattered. With the bodies of the House of Bourbon-Anjou now lying in an unmarked grave somewhere in the Spanish countryside, the fate of Spain has now been sealed with its recent political deadlock no doubt to blame for such an aggressive turn, as its new President, Francisco Frutos, seems poised to eradicate all traces of the royalist past. Having barely managed to escape the country, the duties of the Spanish crown have now fallen to Carlos Javier and the House of Bourbon-Parma, who have vowed to ensure that justice is dealt to those who would dare seek to emulate the horrors of the Soviet Union onto his Kingdom."

However, such attempts by the King to void the election results have now backfired as, despite continued warnings from former Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, the combined efforts of the barricades established across Madrid, the rejection of the military to crackdown on protests, and the level of support for the incoming Prime Minister, Felipe IV has now fled the country with his family. While not officially abdicating, Felipe’s decision to flee Spain has left Zarzuela Palace and the throne empty. While many had anticipated newly inaugurated Prime Minister Cristina Narbona to abolish the monarchy, the succession laws have instead been altered to pass the crown to the head of the House of Bourbon-Parma, Carlos Javier. With the Carlist claimant having been supportive of the government, it is clear that the alteration of the succession laws is a purely political move, with the Prime Minister seeking the validation of the crown and hoping to avoid the lingering slander that her government will seek to impose Marxist policies."

spain_news.34.d:0 "In a rocky start to Spanish democracy, Mariano Rajoy has been removed from office following the passage of a motion of no-confidence in his leadership. Having uncovered systemic levels of corruption within Rajoy’s government, with findings concluding that various members of the government had been profiteering from the privatization of the Spanish military, it did not take long for the Cortes to instigate a motion of no-confidence in the once-thought incorruptible politician. With loopholes in the legislation intentionally allowing cabinet officials to make millions of pesetas, the bipartisan motion of no-confidence has now confirmed that Rajoy will be forced, once more, to resign from politics. With calls for the Prime Minister and the various members of the government who partook in the profiteering to be placed on trial for defrauding the government, these demands are unlikely to materialize given the King’s continued influence over politics. Despite reforms to its system, the crisis has proven that even though Spain has shown a willingness to change, its politicians have not. As Rajoy’s right hand, Soraya Sáenz de Santamaría, now succeeds her mentor, becoming the first female Prime Minister in Spanish history, there is concern that her leadership will be no different."

With calls for the Prime Minister and the various members of One Spain who also partook in the profiteering to be placed on trial for defrauding the government is quickly silenced by the King’s decision to pardon these officials the whole situation has proven that even though Spain has undergone reform, there remains significant progress to be made before it can be called a full democracy. As Rajoy’s right hand, Soraya Sáenz de Santamaría, now succeeds her mentor, becoming the first female Prime Minister in Spanish history, there is concern that her leadership will be no different and that the lessons learned over the last few years have already been forgotten."

spain_news.36.d:0 "News has now left Madrid from the Hospital Universitario Madrid announcing the passing of President Francisco Frutos, who, following a lengthy year-long battle with lung cancer, has now succumbed to his illness. While being granted the best healthcare services available, it seems as though the aging revolutionary's time had come with multiple surgeries having already failed to cure his cancer. As the Republic now enters a month-long period of mourning, the Communist Party of Spain has now assembled to discuss and elect Frutos’ successor, with the future of Spanish communism now once more in the hands of its representatives. Hoping to avoid a repeat of the United Left debates, the Communist Party has spent much of the last few years carefully establishing a clear line of succession, with Ástor García now receiving the support of the Communist Party, being elected its General Secretary and the next President of Spain. While deviating from Frutos slightly, García’s success has come from the Communist Party’s recognition of the need for the continuation of the status quo and a stable hand for the continuation of the revolution, as opposed to the radical fanaticism suggested by some. With García having little to prove to his party, it seems the Spanish revolution shall continue relatively unaltered."

While some had hoped that the passing of Frutos would see a gradual relaxation of revolutionary rhetoric, it appears President Vaquero will seek to double down on the nature of the revolution, calling on the people of Spain to finish what the father of Spanish communism had started. As the Spanish revolution now enters its second stage, it seems as though the legacy of Frutos is poised to carry Spain on forever."

SPR_uphold_sanctity_of_crown_desc:0 "For nearly its entire existence Spain has existed as a monarchy and through our will it always will be. Our government will now officially move to recognize and uphold the sanctity of the crown, protecting it and all the traditions it guards from the radical republicans who seek to tear it down. Through reverence of the monarchy and it’s tradition Spain will finally find stability."

SPR_king_in_parliament_desc:0 "Debate over the new constitution has led to the issue of governance and the power of the King, who we have decided will be a figurehead. Instead the duty of governing now falls almost entirely upon the Cortes and the Prime Minister and to guarantee this duty can be fulfilled we shall create the position of Deputy Prime Minister, who will serve as the Prime Minister's right hand, helping them govern effectively. The King’s role in legislation will be limited to a seat in parliament."

SPR_king_as_sic_desc:0 "Debate over the new constitution has led to the issue of governance and the power of the King, who we have decided should retain extensive legislative powers. Since Spain’s founding the King has guided and protected us and he will continue to do so throughout the new century. The more moderate members of our coalition see this as a betrayal of democratic values, but we are certain this is the right choice."

SPR_rc_ties_to_church_desc:0 "Spain is a nation with deep Catholic traditions that are core to the Spanish national identity itself. While the Church contributes to education and charity, its political influence remains a contentious issue and stirs debate, with critics on the left condemning it as an assault on democracy itself. Nonetheless, the government sees it as vital for fostering stability and protecting traditional values."

SPR_universal_suffrage_desc:0 "Another issue dividing our coalition has reared its ugly head- voting rights. After much deliberation it was decided that we must guarantee universal suffrage for all Spanish citizens above the age of 18. Although the most conservative members of our coalition view this as a reckless expansion of voting to reckless people, it is by far the most popular option, and the only option if we are to truly call ourselves a government of the people."
SPR_limited_suffrage:0 "Limited Suffrage"
SPR_limited_suffrage_desc:0 "Another issue dividing our coalition has reared its ugly head- voting rights. After much deliberation it was decided that it is optimal to reform the old Francoist voting laws, regardless of the outrage from the moderate members of our coalition. By lowering the voting age to 18 and loosening certain restrictions we can expand the right to vote to more Spaniards whilst still guaranteeing voting remains in the hands of only responsible citizens."

SPR_rc_new_military_admins_desc:0 "The Spanish military is deeply outdated. This holds true for more than the equipment though as many of the military’s highest ranking bureaucrats and advisors are also far past their prime and in need of replacement.

Though they may have failed, their memory must not be forgotten by modern Spain. Heroes from across our country will be memorialized, taking the places of the despicable fascists.

Local elections will be held throughout our republic, and multiple figures will be allowed to appear on the ballot.

SPR_limited_union_autonomy_desc:0 "Our revolution was founded through a general strike and the valiant efforts of organized labor. The unions must remain free, and they must continue to have the power to defend the rights of the workers, but perhaps it would be best if they were kept on a tight leash regardless.

SPR_nationalize_the_trade_unions_desc:0 "Though to some, it may seem contrary to the ideals of socialism, independent trade unions are a dangerous liability. The UGT is infested with syndicalists, liberals, and bourgeois leftists, an ailment that can only be cured via direct control from the vanguard party. As such, the UGT must be merged with the Workers’ Commissions, the official labor union of the Communist Party of Spain. Our workers are the heart and soul of our revolutionary state, and they will come to understand that this was not done to curtail their rights but to strengthen them."

Though some may cry foul, there is no place for liberal dissent in the revolutionary state.

#leader descriptions
POLITICS_ARNALDO_OTEGI_DESC:0 "For years now, Arnaldo Otegi has held the high honor of being among the most wanted men in Spain. A longstanding champion of Basque independence and a devoted socialist, his status as a political dissident goes without saying. His position in the upper echelons of Basque Homeland and Liberty, better known as ETA, has been something of an open secret for decades, and yet, he has managed to dodge the law at every turn. Charged with everything from glorifying terrorism to being directly involved in the assassination of Prime Minister José María Aznar in 1995, the Spanish justice system has yet to be able to definitively prove Otegi’s connections to ETA, despite the numerous times the Spanish Civil Guard has attempted to pry evidence out of Otegi and his alleged associates through the means of torture. As such, every time he has been arrested, the Spanish state has been forced to release him in short order, lest his unjust imprisonment or execution spark mass uprising in the Basque Country. With the conditions in Spain changing and the struggle for Basque independence begun, few should be surprised to see Arnaldo Otegi taking center-stage, organizing and leading a broad coalition of Basque separatist groups and directing the fledgling nation’s army. It’s impossible to say how long Otegi’s coalition will survive, but for the time being, he stands as the first man in living memory to offer the Basque people a genuine chance at freedom from Spain."
POLITICS_XOSE_MANUEL_BEIRAS_DESC:0 "Xosé Manuel Beiras is among the most accomplished and charismatic intellectuals in Galicia, if not in the whole of Spain. Holding various degrees in law, economics, linguistics, and literature, Beiras has both studied and taught at universities throughout Spain and Western Europe. During the decades of Francisco Franco’s dictatorship in Spain, Beiras helped to found the Galician Socialist Party, and used his position in the party to make contact with other European socialist parties prior to the fall of Western Europe to communism. Franco, likely on account of his own Galician heritage, never devoted extensive effort to repressing Galician nationalism, and so Beiras was able to spread his influence and notoriety without excessive risk of imprisonment. Things changed in 1976 when King Juan Carlos I seized absolute control of Spain. During the ensuing Years of Lead, the Spanish Civil Guard frequently clashed with Galician left-wing nationalist militants, who often collaborated with the Basque left-wing nationalist group Basque Homeland and Liberty, better known as ETA. As a result of this violence, Galician nationalist and socialist organizations were recognized by the Spanish state as dangerous and subversive, and Beiras was forced to tone down his activism to avoid falling afoul of the law. Nevertheless, Beiras has remained the charismatic face of Galician independence, and with Spain in chaos and the fires of revolution already burning in Catalonia, there was never any doubt that Beiras would be the one to unite Galicia’s nationalists in armed resistance to Spanish rule."
POLITICS_CARLES_PUIGDEMONT_DESC:0 "Coming from a family of Catalan nationalists, Carles Puigdemont is but the last of many who have fought for an independent Catalonia. Born and raised in the village of Amer, Puigdemont joined underground Catalan youth groups already in his teenage years. At the same time, he lived an unassuming public life as a journalist at the local news paper, using its facilities to also run his own underground newspaper, El Punt. But his involvement in the independence struggle only grew. Eventually coming into contact with the Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia, Puigdemont was convinced that Catalonia's best chances for independence lied with the European Union. Coming from a family of business owners, Puigdemont was never the Communist stalwart, but he joined the party nevertheless. Rising in the ranks speedily thanks to his ownership of El Punt, Puigdemont joined the Politburo at the age of 33 in 1995. Thanks to his connections from working with El Punt, the Unified Socialists were able to establish relations with other separatist groups, like the Workers' Front and the exiled Republican Left, unifying the separatist left. But as time went by, the price on his head grew, and eventually, he and the other leaders of the separatist movement were ratted out. In a daring raid by Spanish authorities on a joint meeting, most of its leadership were captured. Puigdemont, however, managed to escape to Brussels, from where he has been the de-facto leader of the Catalan separatists since. In a historic echo, the Catalans are once more taking up arms. Once, they struck at their foes with their sickles, as the anthem Els Segadors alludes to. Now, under his leadership, they will strike with both hammer and sickle. The culmination of his life's work is about to begin."

SPR_RED_WORLD_DESC:0 "Since the failure of democratization in 1976, the Kingdom of Spain has held firm as one of the few anticommunist holdouts left in Europe. While many see Spain as the torchbearer of modern absolutism, the reign of King Juan Carlos I has been plagued by military politicization, partisan violence, economic isolation, and separatism, among other ailments. Through all of this, Spain has held together, seemingly by the sheer force of its king’s will. But the years have not been kind to him. Many worry about the king’s health and the efficacy of his heir apparent, the pampered Felipe. Change appears to be on the horizon. All it may take is a leap of faith."

galicia.1.t:0 "Debates in the Nationalist Bloc"
galicia.1.d:0 "After a hard-fought and bloody struggle for independence from Spain, the guns at last lie quiet. Yet the days of celebration have been short-lived, with the political realities of running a newly independent and deeply divided state quickly set in. The Galician Nationalist Bloc, long held together by shared convictions in socialism, Galician nationhood, and the desire for independence from Spain, no longer holds the unity it did before the war. Xose Manuel Beiras may have founded this coalition, but he is not the only influential figure within it. Most notable are Anxo Quintana, a trained nurse and vocal syndicalist who wields the support of many of the nation’s trade unions, and Néstor Rego, a teacher-turned-guerilla backed by a majority of Galicia’s military and many radical university students. With Bloc unity on the decline, it has been decided that comprehensive debates must be held to determine the country’s path going forward. The announcement of these debates, however, has been met with criticism, with the country’s many social democrats and conservatives taking issue with the fact that no party outside of the Galician Nationalist Bloc is allowed to participate in these debates. Nevertheless, it seems that the future of Galicia shall soon be decided at the debate table."
galicia.1.o1:0 "This shouldn't take too long"

galicia.2.t:0 "Opposition Calls For Elections"
galicia.2.d:0 "In a surprising joint statement following a wave of protests, the People’s Party and the Socialist Workers’ Party of Galicia have demanded that we hold elections now instead of allowing the Bloc debates to continue their natural course. They accuse the BNG of using the war for independence to unjustly usurp the reins of the nation for political reasons. While we should not legitimize their baseless claims with a response, the mounting pressure to call for an election has reached the highest halls of power, as President Beiras has been rumored to begin drafting a resolution to call for elections as soon as possible. This would prove to be a hard pill to swallow for the Bloque Nacionalista Galego and the most radical factions, as the PP and the PSdeG stand as great political opponents should an election be held, with it being estimated that either party could be elected and remove the BNG from power. The most radical factions of the BNG also see the two parties as leftovers of a legacy of Spanish colonialism, therefore, their demands do not fit the new Galizan nation. This mounting pressure is rocking our young republic, and something must be done to quell these demands - be it by acquiescing to them or outright rejecting them."
galicia.2.o1:0 "They just need some patience"

galicia.3.t:0 "Nationalist Bloc Delays Elections"
galicia.3.d:0 "As both General Secretary of the BNG and President of the Republic of Galiza, Xose Manuel Beiras has much power over the Galician Nationalist Bloc and, therefore, the Galician government. But his power is certainly not absolute, as was proven today when, without the permission of Beiras, hardline members of the BNG voted down Beiras’ proposal for elections, citing national security concerns. It would seem this was more of an effort to prevent the two other major political parties in Galicia, the People’s Party and the Socialist Workers’ Party, from taking power. Though this may secure the power of the Galician Nationalist Bloc for the time being, many within the Bloc are outraged by what they consider to be a blatant infringement of democracy, including President Beiras. Beiras, who promised free and fair elections after the revolution, was outraged by the hardliners’ refusal to let elections occur. In a press conference, President Beiras condemned the hardliners of his party and proclaimed that he would work to see democracy come to Galicia, one way or another. It appears that it is up to President Beiras alone whether his allegiance lies with the Galician Nationalist Bloc or with the Republic’s democracy."
galicia.3.o1:0 "The Bloc Must Be Maintained"
galicia.3.o2:0 "Democracy is Non-Negotiable!"

galicia.4.t:0 "Opposition Condemns Beiras' Hypocrisy"
galicia.4.d:0 "Our government is once again under repeated attack by both the People's Party and the Socialist Workers' Party of Galicia, now with President Beiras being the main target of their vitriol. After conceding on the election issue this morning at a BNG event in Lugo, the President soon after held a speech where he stated, and hopefully convinced the nation, that all citizens are united under the future of a free Galiza, with it their duty to hold strong in the face of uncertainty. Concluding the event, the President was photographed with members of the hardline wing of the BNG, with the opposition in the PP and PSdeG seeing this as nothing more than a capitulation to anti-democratic forces, condemning what they see as the hypocritical actions of a man who promised elections but caved into radical demands. President Beiras' loyalty to the BNG and socialism has caused the already large protest movement to energize and expand the scope of their operations, with some demonstrations even becoming violent, though it's nothing our security forces can't handle. Even with our promise that democracy will come in its own time, it seems like the opposition is uninterested in our assurances, they demand elections right now on their terms. "
galicia.4.o1:0 "All in due time!"

galicia.5.t:0 "Civil Guard Join Protests"
galicia.5.d:0 "As the situation on the streets deteriorates, more and more forces join the side of the protesters. Now former Guardia Civil officers, plain clothed and uniformed alike, have begun marching alongside those who oppose the Bloque Nacionalista Galego. In opposition newspapers, Guardia Civil talking heads like anti-communist police agent José Amedo claim that their participation in the protests is a crusade for justice, stability, order, and peace, and they also say that our government is acting directly against these same principles. Their actions in these protests are worrying, to say the least, as reports say they acted as muscle for the opposition, with their members being some of the most provocative during demonstrations and getting into scuffles with our supporters and security forces. The Hard Left and the Revolutionary Army alike warn Beiras of what this may mean and say that a counter-revolution is nigh if we do not take action, especially because the PP has even come as far as to support the involvement of the Guardia. While we are not as paranoid as they are, the BNG can agree that the mobilization of these men is only a warning of what is to come, and the Revolutionary Army as well as local police forces have already been mobilized to their full extent."
galicia.5.o1:0 "Reactionary fools"

galicia.6.t:0 "The Battle of Santiago de Compostela"
galicia.6.d:0 "What was just yet another protest in front of the Presidential Palace of Pazo de Raxoi has now turned into a bloody riot. As the opposition tried to push the police line, a huge fight broke out, with armed officers of the old Guardia Civil failing to breach our defenses, with any arrests we made being dwarfed by the planned reinforcement of opposition forces. As the situation deteriorated, barricades were set up by rebel forces who retreated into the city, occupying the Santiago de Compostela University, while another fight broke out near the Parliament Building where, once again, the Guardia was the main instigator of violence. To quell the situation, we have sent independence war veteran Colonel Xosé Cid Cabido alongside his Anova battalion, where we are now faced with a difficult situation. Should we risk losing the Parliament and bunker down in front of the Palace, attritioning Guardia forces, eventually sieging the University, or split our forces evenly to hopefully be able to stop both attacks and conduct a pincer maneuver to crush this revolt, this option leaving our forces in the Palace weaker. Fires burn, snipers take position, trigger fingers itch, tension runs high, and time ticks by. With time running out, Colonel Cid must now make a decision."
galicia.6.o1:0 "Protect the Palace at all costs!"
galicia.6.o2:0 "The Parliament must not fall!"

galicia.7.t:0 "Revolutionary Army Triumphant"
galicia.7.d:0 "After heavy fighting and a lucky break, Guardia Civil officers breached our Parliament Building. While they tried to make arrests and coup our government, they soon realized that Parliament wasn't in for today. So they did as their fellow traitors in the University of Santiago de Compostela and barricaded themselves inside. Hours passed as the quick skirmishes that characterized this battle made their way into a drawn-out siege, with any fascist attempts to break out or reinforce their positions met with swift arrests from our police or, if necessary, hot lead from our army. In the middle of the night, the Anova battalion, SWAT forces, and commando troops stormed both the Parliament building and the Presidential Palace simultaneously, making arrests, taking out any resistance, and liberating staff that got entangled in the crossfire. With sniper positions watching over any possible escape routes, helicopters watching over the city, and all exits blocked by armored police cars, it was over. The leaders of this revolt were carried off in black vans towards prison for the crimes of treason. This was a resounding victory for Galiza and all her loyal citizens, and it has crushed any hope of the opposition for overthrowing our peaceful government of the people."
galicia.7.o1:0 "Os fascistas non pasaron!"

galicia.8.t:0 "Debates Resume"
galicia.8.d:0 "As the smoke cleared out and the cleanup process of the capital city began, normalcy had mostly returned to the nation. As protests and opposition rallies died down, the process of debates within the BNG resumed. All across the nation, union halls, football stadiums, university assemblies, school gyms, and community centers all host lively debates on the course of workers’ cooperatives, central planning, Hispanophone rights, national defense, and most importantly, the way intra-party democracy operates, and who is to lead the party after the recent tumultuous times that grasped our young republic. As debate continues, a small culture war has now sparked up during these same party debates regarding the national flag, with moderate forces defending the traditional flag, which displays the royal crown of Spain, arguing that the historical nature of the banner overrules its supposed alignment to a foreign crown, with older-minded Galicianists, in vain, siding with the moderates, opposing the change to a possible Estreleira flag, only to be shut down by the more vocal student activists and socialist radicals who oppose flying the old flag. With these discussions escalating, they truly mirror the rising factionalism within the party, and it becomes clear that the debates are as lively as ever."
galicia.8.o1:0 "We will reach consensus"

galicia.9.t:0 "Quintana Gaining Influence"
galicia.9.d:0 "Hundreds have today gathered at the assembly hall of the Universidade de Vigo to be present at yet another debate poised to decide the future of the BNG. In attendance, various party officials from all over the Republic gathered, ranging from President Manuel Beiras to the cadres of the party Politburo, to cabinet members and even mayors from all over Galiza. However, despite the belief that such an event would be filled with debate from all voices in attendance quickly spiralled into a one-man show. What had started as a seemingly rehearsed discussion of the future of healthcare and the need for social inclusion, quickly became a lauding speech of Anxo Quintana and his unionization drives for nurses and his attempts to develop rural healthcare after the mayor of Ourense took the podium, with the President of the University continuing to praise Quintana, citing his academic achievements. This then gave way to Quintana, giving a lengthy presentation on his plans for the economy, health networks, public projects, and so on. What had started as a debate then wound up becoming something of a campaign rally for Quintana, with the syndicalist finishing his speech chanting three words along with the crowd: “Galiza, Labor and Freedom!” - all while the rest of party leadership stared at this with looks of confusion and befuddlement, asking themselves as to how this even happened."
galicia.9.o1:0 "Something is suspicious"

galicia.10.t:0 "Beiras Accuses Quintana of Corruption"
galicia.10.d:0 "It was a cloudy morning in Santiago de Compostela, and as the people went about their day, another debate was being held. This time, the Teatro Principal was the locale chosen by Bloc organizers. Hundreds of nationalists gathered there with figures such as Anxo Quintana and even President Beiras. As rounds and rounds of debates developed, the cloudy day gave in to a rainy morning. As the raindrops fell on top of the over one-hundred-year-old building, Xosé Manuel Beiras took to the podium, and what many expected to be a stump speech to begin a round of debates about public transportation quickly became a public denunciation of Anxo Quintana, whom Beiras called "an opportunistic scoundrel" who was seeking to corrupt Galiza's nascent democracy and twist its institutions for his gain. While Quintana rushed to the microphone as he shoved Beiras aside, the mild rain became a downpour. Quintana defended himself by utterly rejecting the president's claims, with a hand firmly on his shoulder, calling him a "useful idiot for reactionary forces" who was in his way, dooming Galizan nationhood. This almost turned into a generalized fistfight and was only stopped by other members of the BNG present on stage, who then promptly canceled the day's debate. As people poured out and were met with a thunderstorm, they knew they had been the audience of the first act of a play that may destroy our nationalist coalition."
galicia.10.o1:0 "Now isn't the time for fighting!"

galicia.11.t:0 "Quintana and Beiras seek Rego's Support"
galicia.11.d:0 "With party unity deteriorating, democratic socialists and syndicalists find themselves stalemated. As ballots in debates see no clear majority, with clear abstention or just no solid party line for student radicals and nationalist soldiers, the other main groups in our coalition seek their support. Professor Néstor Rego, General Secretary of the UPG, has participated in many backdoor meetings with both Anxo Quintana and Xosé Manuel Beiras. Anxo Quintana promises Rego "rightful power" to the Galizan population, a crackdown on private property, and closer adherence to Marxist principles, warning Rego of Beiras' reformist tendencies and him possibly handing power away to reactionary forces. Beiras has tried to appeal to Rego on the principle of protecting Galiza's national institutions from whom he calls a demagogue, while giving him his word to maintain and expand the independence and power of universities. As Rego consults his inner circle, with veterans who served alongside trade union militias favoring Quintana and students who took the streets for the Bloc favoring Beiras, party stalwarts within the UPG have warned him that he may be throwing away his shot on these two men, and that their current weakness shows how he may be the only one who can rise to the occasion. After one last meeting with UPG leadership late into the night, the decision has become very clear what Rego will do."

galicia.12.t:0 "Rego and Quintana Merge Factions"
galicia.12.d:0 "Tipping the current scales of the party's power struggle strongly to Anxo Quintana's side, UPG leader Néstor Rego has officially decided to form a "Nationalist Popular Front" within the Nationalist Bloc, effectively merging his faction of guerrilla veterans and student activists with Quintana’s trade union militants. Speaking in an event held in Santiago de Compostela, where both Anxo and himself were present, Rego lauded this joining of forces, calling it the "first step of the march of millions of free people into true independence", before giving space for Quintana to continue the merge of party factions as he listed off the Popular Front's thorough belief of the need of the Nationalist Bloc's primacy for defending national stability and independence. This alliance has already bore fruit, as in a debate held mere hours after the formation of the Nationalist Popular Front, motions to open party wide voting on the formation of a "Collectivization Bureau" inside the BNG's political committee of A Coruña province have been approved, with the Bureau well on its way to be ratified by other municipal chapters of the provincial section of the party. Leaks from the Presidential Palace paint a bleak picture for President Beiras, with his attempts to call and arrange meetings with people he thought were his allies giving him empty platitudes, or just not picking up at all, with the staffer who leaked such info describing it all as a "sad, but inevitable affair.""
galicia.12.o1:0 "A new dominant force in the Bloc"

galicia.13.t:0 "Debates Continue"
galicia.13.d:0 "As the debates go on with days of silence despite continued party infighting, Néstor Rego of the UPG has seemingly decided to back neither side of the Beiras-Quintana faction dispute. In an interview conducted by journalists of Faro de Vigo, after being asked about the current factionalism in debates, Rego simply said that he believed intra-party democracy was taking its course and that a "unifying, reasonable and ideologically consistent position should be found soon". This comes against the backdrop of tacit support from Rego's allies of Quintana during party debates, where the trade unionist has continued to make big waves, recently scoring a big win after his home province of Ourense decided to open a commission on a referendum that, if successful, would let trade unions have four reserved seats on the Galician parliament out of its fourteen, with members of the general congress of Ourense trade unions being able to vote on who is sent to Parliament. While the constitutionality of such a policy is currently discussed, UPG members in Ourense were enthusiastic supporters of Quintana's project. Even more surprisingly, former Beiras allies and UPG members have begun a similar measure in Pontevedra. The President himself continues to try and rally his supporters, who grow smaller in numbers as enthusiasm for his government steadily deflates, with Quintana’s support surging."
galicia.13.o1:0 "The Bloc must remain strong"

galicia.14.t:0 "Rego and Beiras Launch Investigation"
galicia.14.d:0 "A quiet yet consequential recalibration of power within the Galician Nationalist Bloc has emerged. Néstor Rego, now throwing his weight behind Xosé Manuel Beiras, has forged an unlikely alliance aimed at stalling the meteoric rise of Anxo Quintana. Following protracted behind-the-scenes negotiations, the two men, divided by temperament but now united by political necessity, have agreed to initiate an internal investigation into Quintana’s conduct, citing growing concerns over his influence within the party and the speed with which he has consolidated support. The investigation, while officially framed as a routine inquiry into procedural irregularities, is widely viewed as a strategic attempt to unearth or manufacture evidence of corruption. Beiras, who has previously accused Quintana of seeking to bend democracy for personal gain, now finds himself aided by elements of the armed forces. These units, operating under a veil of discretion, have begun assisting in the probe, combing through records and correspondence for anything that might tarnish the populist’s ascent. While no findings have yet been released, the move marks a dramatic escalation in the Bloc’s internal conflict and may set the stage for a legal showdown at the heart of the Republic."
galicia.14.o1:0 "When the ballot falters, reach for the dossier"

galicia.15.t:0 "Debates Continue"
galicia.15.d:0 "In a move that has signaled the accelerating fragmentation of Galicia’s post-independence, the newly formed Nationalist Popular Front has entered parliamentary debate with the clear intention of removing Xosé Manuel Beiras from power. The debates, ostensibly convened to finalize a working constitution, have devolved into a series of increasingly sharp exchanges, in which Beiras, once the emblem of the Bloc’s wartime unity, now finds himself sidelined and silenced. His speaking time is cut short, his motions are tabled, and then buried. The floor, instead, belongs to Anxo Quintana and Néstor Rego. With the Popular Front holding a commanding majority, the outcome of the vote appears foregone. Yet beneath the polished facade of unity, Rego’s allegiance to Quintana remains uncertain. Now in quiet control of the armed forces and possessing strong ties within the state apparatus, the General Secretary of the Galician People’s Union stands poised to claim the presidency for himself, should he choose to do so. As ballots are cast beneath the frescoed ceilings of the new Republican Chamber, Galicia’s future hangs not in principle, but in personal calculation."

galicia.16.d:0 "Finally ending months of uncertainty within the Galician Nationalist Bloc, Anxo Quintana has formally succeeded Xosé Manuel Beiras as leader of the BNG and, by extension, as head of the newly independent Galician Republic. The vote, conducted in a closed session of the Bloc’s central committee, was swift and near-unanimous, a reflection of the bloc’s shifting loyalties since the end of the war with Madrid. At the heart of Quintana’s triumph lies the steadfast support of Néstor Rego, whose decision to remain loyal has extinguished any speculation that Rego's loyalties had lain elsewhere, perhaps only to himself. Together, Quintana and Rego have now presented a consolidated front, populist in tone, methodical in approach, and with a mandate forged in both military victory and political maneuvering. Beiras, whose moral authority once anchored the independence movement, left the chamber in silence, hardly noticed by the cheering representatives of parliament, and his role was reduced to that of a witness to the order he helped create. With the transfer of power complete, attention now turns to constitution-building and the first test of governance without the man who defined its struggle."
galicia.16.o1:0 "Beiras led the revolution, but Quintana shall build the state"

galicia.17.t:0 "Rego Emerges as Leader"
galicia.17.d:0 "Despite beliefs that the new alliance between Quintana and Rego would hold throughout the debates and well into the Republic's future, a stunning escalation of the power struggle within the Galician Nationalist Bloc has now presented itself for all the Republic to see. Néstor Rego, once believed to have been Quintana's second, has surged to the forefront of parliamentary debate, sidelining both his opponents and, unexpectedly, his ally. Though the Nationalist Popular Front was formed to challenge Xosé Manuel Beiras jointly, it is now Rego who commands the floor, his voice bolstered by a growing consensus and the quiet pressure of military presence in the chamber’s periphery. At Rego’s request, the armed forces, newly emboldened in the political arena, have adopted a more visible posture, reinforcing his authority without explicit intervention. Former allies of Beiras, weary and disoriented after the Battle of Santiago de Compostela, have begun to drift into Rego’s orbit, citing pragmatism and stability. Quintana, the original challenger, now finds himself increasingly overshadowed in the very campaign he helped initiate. With Rego dominating the debate, parliament was quick to confirm him as Beiras' successor, with a near-unanimous vote, with the only objections coming from a handful of loyalists within Quintana and Beiras' circles, now ensuring his ascendancy to President of the Republic."

galicia.18.t:0 "Quintana Emerges as Leader"
galicia.18.d:0 "In a development that has formalized a long-simmering political shift within the Galician Nationalist Bloc, Anxo Quintana has been elected as the new head of the BNG and, by extension, President of the Galician Republic. The vote follows weeks of increasingly lopsided debates, where Quintana’s presence at the table grew steadily more commanding as supporters of Xosé Manuel Beiras, once the undisputed figurehead of the independence struggle, drifted away in search of fresh direction and firmer leadership. Néstor Rego, whose decision to remain neutral was widely seen as pivotal, ultimately watched from the sidelines as Quintana built consensus without him, watching on dismayed at the failings of early Galician democracy. Though the two had briefly shared a common front, it was Quintana alone who seized the momentum. The motion to remove Beiras was passed with little resistance, reflecting not only the erosion of his support but also the Bloc’s desire to begin the next chapter with a clean break from its founding generation. With his ascent, Quintana becomes the first post-war president to hold office through internal party democracy, a sign, perhaps, that the institutions of the Republic are beginning to settle."
galicia.18.o1:0 "The war hero is out, the party man is in!"

galicia.19.t:0 "Investigation Reveals Corruption"
galicia.19.d:0 "A dramatic and deeply destabilizing turn within the Galician Nationalist Bloc has now taken place, as the internal investigation spearheaded by allies of Xosé Manuel Beiras and Néstor Rego has now produced what it claims is irrefutable evidence of widespread corruption orchestrated by Anxo Quintana. According to documents unveiled during a charged parliamentary session, Quintana, with the assistance of union operatives loyal to him, maintained a clandestine network of blackmail and bribery designed to coerce support, silence dissent within the Bloc, and ensure Quintana’s rise to the office of President. The revelation, delivered to audible gasps from within the chamber, has prompted an immediate backlash. While a core of Quintana loyalists remained defiant, dismissing the evidence as fabrication or politically motivated sabotage, the majority shifted decisively. Within the hour, a motion was passed to expel Quintana from the Bloc and physically remove him from the debate hall. Security officials, acting on parliamentary orders, escorted him from the building under a cloud of suspicion and disgrace. With an official police investigation now expected to follow, one that will certainly find Quintana guilty on all charges, the meteoric rise of the populist has now been crushed, with the future of the Republic now secured for Beiras."
galicia.19.o1:0 "That rat!"

galicia.20.t:0 "Debates Continue Without Quintana"
galicia.20.d:0 "With the fall of Anxo Quintana, the storm within the Galician Nationalist Bloc has narrowed to two figures, Xosé Manuel Beiras, the aging revolutionary and architect of independence, and Néstor Rego, the calculating tactician whose quiet influence now permeates both party and state. Though other voices remain, most notably Francisco Jorquera, the rising syndicalist whose rhetoric has stirred certain sections of the Bloc, none have managed to step out from the long shadows cast by Beiras and Rego. Jorquera, like others, now finds himself cornered into alignment, his principles reduced to a strategic endorsement. As the debates wind down, what remains is not so much consensus as exhaustion as the Bloc now moves to enshrine Beiras as the President of Galicia. However, despite the assumption that Rego would merely sit down and accept his partner's ascension to the presidency, it appears as though Beiras' younger counterpart now seeks the role himself. Having utilized his position as the right hand of Beiras, Rego has declared that it was he who brought down Quintana and that every move made by Beiras in the last few weeks was only allowed due to his influence and connections. Seemingly hoping to sway the BNG to his side and reveal Beiras as a man too old to lead, the once-thought-unanimous ascension of the revolutionary, has now become a divisive election."

galicia.21.d:0 "In a decisive culmination of weeks of political intrigue, Néstor Rego has emerged as the new leader of the Galician Nationalist Bloc and, by extension, the President of the Galician Republic. With Anxo Quintana expelled in disgrace and Xosé Manuel Beiras increasingly cast as a relic of a bygone revolutionary age, Rego and his supporters have deftly seized control of the party’s internal machinery, reshaping the debate space into a platform for his quiet, calculating ascent. Playing to anxieties over Beiras’ advanced age and waning political acuity, Rego continued to publicly claim full authorship of the operation that brought down Quintana, painting himself as the Republic’s protector rather than a schemer in the shadows as his opposition had been so easy to paint him as. It was a narrative most found convenient to believe. Through a carefully choreographed mix of omission, flattery, and suggestion, Rego transformed suspicion into trust, cementing a majority behind him. What began as a power struggle within a fragmented movement has now ended with a singular victor, one whose methods, while questionably democratic, have proven brutally effective. Now, Galicia enters a new chapter under Rego, led not by the firebrand or the populist, but by the man who outlasted them both."

galicia.22.t:0 "Beiras Retains Leadership"
galicia.22.d:0 "In a stunning political reversal, Xosé Manuel Beiras has reasserted his dominance within the Galician Nationalist Bloc, emerging from a period of internal crisis not weakened, but emboldened. With Anxo Quintana cast out and Néstor Rego increasingly painted as a manipulator rather than a statesman, the veteran revolutionary has rallied the Bloc around his leadership, securing his mandate as both party leader and President of the Republic. Far from shying away from questions of age, Beiras instead leaned into them, evoking the sacrifices of the independence war and framing himself as the living embodiment of Galician resilience. His experience, once seen as a liability, became a talisman as those once questioning his capabilities found a renewed sense of hope in a future where Beiras maintained his position. In contrast, Rego’s calculated maneuvers and growing influence among the armed forces began to arouse suspicion. As murmurs spread through the halls of the debating chamber, many began to see in him not a successor, but a potential threat to both Galician independence and the future of socialism. By the end of the deliberations, the Bloc had shifted decisively. Rego’s challenge evaporated, and Beiras stood unopposed. The old lion remains atop the hill, for now."

Firing and disrupting their march, we were able to generate enough chaos to begin to move into the Palace. As sniper fire rang out, chaos worsened after the Socialist Commanding Officer was seemingly struck down by his forces, being shot by sniper fire. Our men quickly moved into the weakened position and stormed the Presidential Palace, where we caught several members of the government, including the hypocritical despot Xosé Manuel Beiras, whom we arrested on the spot. Then, after our soldiers were able to seize Parliament, we forced the army and police forces to stand down and accept our noble saving revolution. As the socialist cowards of the BNG fled the nation, we swore in Lieutenant Jesús Gayoso as interim president. With the corrective moment finished and order slowly returning to the streets, we are faced with a conundrum: Is the nation ready for democracy? Are communist forces still lingering, waiting to sabotage the democratic process and return to power? Men with experience in the anti-communist struggle like José Amedo demand we don't give in an inch to the forces of socialism.

The experienced old guard is right to say that communist subterfuge and agitation leave no chance for a true election to take place, and if our quest is one for order and peace, liberal politics simply are not compatible with it. Lieutenant Jesús Gayoso met with José Amedo privately, and while not much is known of what their conversation was about, it was clear they discussed the path the nation was to take. Flanked by armed guards, Jesús Gayoso spoke in Santiago de Compostela, denouncing the socialists in the BNG as nothing more than lying terrorists, proclaiming that a new path for national unity was to come, one where elections had to be postponed, finishing the speech by retiring from politics, and returning to public service. With José Amedo quickly being able to rally influence among officers and secure control of the nation petulant crypto-communist and outright Bolshevik forces gathered in the streets in a vain attempt to dissuade the Galician people from a path of law and order under our rule, as our brave officers now begin to patrol the streets aided by the strength of our army. More worryingly, some of these communists have taken to armed warfare, typical of the terroristic nature of their doctrine. With all our forces mobilized and with a man like José Amedo in control, the fatherland can take upon a true path of Galicianist, nationalist, and prosperous government."

galicia.25.d:0 "In a moment long delayed by war and political turbulence, the Galician Republic is today holding its first democratic elections, though not without controversy. With Xosé Manuel Beiras imprisoned following the dramatic fall of the Galician Nationalist Bloc in the Battle of Santiago de Compostela, and the Bloc itself barred from the ballot under emergency measures enacted by interim President Lieutenant Jesús Gayoso, the political space has narrowed sharply. Yet even within these constraints, the atmosphere across Galicia is electric. Voters have turned out in droves, flooding polling stations in Vigo, A Coruña, and Ourense, many waving flags, others carrying banners calling for reconciliation or justice. For many, this is the first time their voice will shape the new Republic’s future, not through bullets, but ballots. Now rising to the forefront are the People's Party, led by the familiar conservative figure of Alberto Núñez Feijóo, and the Socialist Workers' Party of Galicia under Emilio Pérez Touriño. While polls suggest a strong showing for Feijóo and his platform of national reconstruction and order, Touriño has tapped into deep disillusionment, especially among younger voters and former Bloc sympathizers who still maintain that socialism is a possibility in Galicia. Now, with the ballots being counted, it is only a matter of time before the first victor in our Republic's democracy is declared."

galicia.26.d:0 "To the shock of the Republic, President Xose Manuel Beiras and his party, the Galician Left, have split from the Galician National Bloc! After Beiras’ attempts to call for an election were blocked by hardliners within the BNG, Beiras had been vocally outraged at his party’s anti-democratic tendencies. Though many outside observers expected Beiras to eventually reconcile with the rest of the Bloc, days of infighting have finally come to a head. Citing the Bloc’s anti-democratic and radical tendencies, President Beiras announced his party would be withdrawing from the BNG effective immediately. The remaining members of the Bloc, comprised of the syndicalist Union of Nationalists and the hardline communist Galician People’s Union, are apoplectic with rage, condemning Beiras as a “traitor to the Galician people” and calling for all “loyal Galicians to find Beiras and bring justice to him.” With the threat of insurrection by the radicalized BNG now all but certain, President Beiras has ordered Galicia’s municipal police to protect him until the situation has improved. However, many members of the municipal police are ardent supporters of the radical BNG, and it is unknown whether or not the police will agree to protect the President."

galicia.27.d:0 "In a charged and chaotic scene emblematic of Galicia’s fractured politics, the remnants of the Galician Nationalist Bloc stormed the Parliament building in Santiago de Compostela, determined to unseat Xosé Manuel Beiras and reclaim control over what they now derisively call a bourgeois Republic. Once a revolutionary hero, Beiras’ decision to denounce the Bloc and align himself with the opposition parties in defense of open elections has split the soul of the Republic, and today, the rupture has become physical. However, as Bloc-aligned deputies and activists pressed toward the presidential chamber, they were met not by cheering crowds or passive halls, but by lines of riot police, calm, armed, and resolute. In a stunning reversal of loyalty, the police, whose ranks were long believed to lean sympathetically toward the Bloc, chose instead to defend Beiras. The crowd was dispersed, hundreds were arrested, and the Parliament doors were sealed behind shields and batons. Now protected by the very forces the Bloc once co-opted, Beiras has avoided ousting, if only narrowly. In doing so, he has transformed the police into the final guarantors of the democratic experiment he once hesitated to fully embrace."

With the police choosing loyalty to the Nationalist Bloc over the faltering authority of the President, agents aligned with the Bloc stormed the Palacio de Raxoi at dawn. Beiras caught mid-consultation with members of the Socialist Workers’ Party, was detained without resistance. No shots were fired, and none were needed. Now, with the constitutional framework abandoned and emergency broadcasts looping across the Republic’s airwaves, power has been transferred to the Galician People’s Union, the Bloc’s most radical faction and the one with the closest ties to the Revolutionary Army. Néstor Rego, long a shadow behind the Bloc’s most dramatic decisions, has emerged from behind the curtain to assume the role of interim President. His tone, in a brief but pointed address, struck a blend of calm reassurance and revolutionary certainty. With the entirety of the Republic hearing his declaration that order had been restored and the betrayal of the Republic was finally over, the Bloc has now resumed control over the national debate, ready to initiate discussions on the future of Galician socialism."

Both presidential and parliamentary contests are now scheduled for three weeks from today, a tight but deliberate window designed to give legitimate opposition parties a chance to organize, while granting the police breathing room to neutralize lingering Bloc loyalists still believed to be planning acts of sabotage. Declaring from the steps of the recently liberated capital, Beiras, flanked by senior members of the Socialist Workers’ Party and the People's Party, announced that the time had finally come for the people, not the vanguard nor bullets, to decide Galicia's future. His statement has now marked a final break with the revolutionary past that brought him to power and a gamble that his new allies in the democratic opposition and the security forces can keep the fragile Republic from sliding back into chaos. Already, the People's Party and Socialist Workers’ Party are ramping up their campaigns, while leaflets bearing Beiras' face are being torn down by Bloc loyalists in the night."

The first truly democratic elections of the new Republic are underway, marked by heavy turnout, tight security, and a quiet but growing sense that history is again tilting on its axis. Though Beiras’ stature as the father of independence and his last-minute commitment to democracy have earned him admiration across generational lines, the political landscape has shifted. The conservative People’s Party, led by Alberto Núñez Feijóo, has capitalized on lingering fears of instability and positioned itself as the party of order and normalcy. Their message has found particular resonance in rural Galicia and among the business community, many of whom feel alienated by Beiras' revolutionary legacy. Meanwhile, Emilio Pérez Touriño and the Socialist Workers' Party have run a spirited campaign, but few seriously expect them to claim the presidency, largely in part because their messaging and campaign has been overshadowed by Beiras. Touriño’s popularity has grown, particularly among youth and civil servants, but many believe it will take an upset for the Workers' Party to achieve electoral success. Now with ballots being counted, the first results of our young democracy are expected soon."

galicia.31.d:0 "Reassembling what remains of the Galician Nationalist Bloc within the scorched and hollowed halls of the Palacio de Raxoi, where cracked marble still bears the scorch marks of recent conflict, President Néstor Rego has declared the immediate commencement of constitutional debates. Standing beneath the torn banners of the Republic, flanked by members of the Revolutionary Army and Bloc delegates loyal to the People’s Union, Rego made clear that the question of Galician socialism would not wait for the capitalist pawns in the streets to find their footing. With Beiras deposed and the liberal opposition either in hiding or under arrest, Rego now shares the floor primarily with Anxo Quintana, his on-again, off-again ally and perhaps the only other figure within the Bloc with enough sway to shape the coming order. Though tensions between the two have yet to fully subside, both men have committed to what Rego has termed revolutionary permanency, the idea that socialism must not just survive in Galicia but be constitutionally entrenched against reaction. What began as a war for independence is now fast becoming a war for ideology, written not in blood but in law."

galicia.32.d:0 "With the opening volleys of the constitutional debates echoing through the still-cracked walls of the Palacio de Raxoi, the fleeting alliance between Néstor Rego and Anxo Quintana has now crumbled into open ideological warfare. Though both men once stood united in their desire to entrench socialism into the foundations of the new Galician Republic, the drafting of the constitution has made clear that they share little else beyond rhetoric. Now, at the heart of the debate stands a single sentence, one whose wording threatens to divide not just the Bloc, but the country itself. Rego, backed by the urban syndicates and the Revolutionary Army, has demanded that the constitution declare that the revolution will be “guided by the workers,” a phrase that implies a future of forced transformation, smokestacks, railways, planned economies, and steel, a vision of Galicia reborn in iron. Quintana, ever the populist, insists the phrase must instead read “guided by the peasants.” With his power base rooted in the unions, his bloc has warned that anything less would be a betrayal of the land and the people who fought and died under the Republic’s banner. With a single word now dividing the debate hall, the future of the Republic's economy now rests on which group the Bloc is willing to leave behind."

galicia.33.d:0 "The cavernous chambers of the Palacio de Raxoi have once again erupted into a heated debate, this time over a question as delicate as it is defining: what tongue shall carry the voice of the Galician Republic? With Rego’s communist delegates adamant that Galician must be the sole official language of the state, a symbol of cultural sovereignty, and a revolutionary break with Madrid, the stakes could not be higher. Recent census data speaks in Rego’s favor, as a majority of citizens claim fluency in Galician, with over a third using it daily. For Rego, anything less than full linguistic independence risks inviting cultural recolonization through the backdoor. His allies have accused those in favor of Spanish co-recognition of linguistic cowardice, warning that a divided tongue will yield a divided nation. However, Quintana, whose power rests in the sprawling union confederations, has staked his claim on a broader, more pluralistic vision. Backed by several urban Spanish-speaking syndicates, he has proposed that Spanish be retained as a second official language, an olive branch to the twenty-five percent of Galicians who still speak it at home, arguing that revolutionary inclusivity need not come at the expense of linguistic pride. With both sides entrenched, the debate has grown bitter. Shouts of betrayal and chauvinism now ripple through the Bloc’s ranks, and consensus seems increasingly remote."

galicia.34.d:0 "In what many inside the Palacio de Raxoi are calling the final battle of the constitutional debates, a fundamental question now grips the chamber: who shall carry the torch of socialism in the Galician Republic, the vanguard or the workers themselves? With tensions already worn thin by previous disputes over industry and language, this latest divide cuts straight to the ideological marrow of the revolution. Rego, ever the orthodox Marxist, has insisted that the party, as a disciplined vanguard of the proletariat, must oversee the process of socialization. For him, the nationalization of all key sectors under a centralized direction is not a question of control but of survival. Arguing from the dispatch box that, while the people march, the party must lead, Rego's fiery rhetoric has been quick to gain the favor of the more hardline elements of the Bloc. However, Quintana, by contrast, rose to the pulpit to thunderous applause from the syndicalist benches, denouncing any attempt to subordinate the unions to party rule. Warning that a vanguard is a direct path toward a red bureaucracy, the face of decentralization has proclaimed that Galicia should be a state of federated socialism, one guided by workers' congresses and accountable party delegates, not central directives."

galicia.35.t:0 "Debates Come to an End"
galicia.35.d1:0 "Following weeks of fractious debate within the battered halls of the Palacio de Raxoi, Anxo Quintana’s syndicalist bloc has emerged triumphant in shaping the ideological spine of the newly founded Galician Republic. With the constitutional debates now concluded, the final draft, firmly aligned with Quintana’s vision of union-led governance, decentralized control, and dual-language recognition, was passed with a narrow yet conclusive fifty-five percent majority among members of the Galician Nationalist Bloc. Despite holding the title of interim president, Néstor Rego’s authority has all but evaporated, as the Bloc swiftly followed the constitutional vote with a motion to elect a new head of state. Clearly following ideological lines, that vote too, saw a fifty-five percent majority, this time to install Quintana as the President of the Republic. Rego, notably absent from the inauguration of his counterpart, has seemingly accepted the results of the vote, offering no resistance as the Bloc confirmed Quintana’s ascent. Though his presidency is young, Quintana’s rise marks a symbolic and structural shift away from the dreams of vanguardism and centralized control and toward a union-led model of Galician socialism that will no doubt guide our young Republic toward a bright future."
galicia.35.d2:0 "After weeks of intense and often volatile debate within the Galician Nationalist Bloc, Néstor Rego’s faction has emerged as the unchallenged architect of the Republic’s foundational order. Securing an overwhelming seventy-three percent vote in favor of his constitution, one that places the vanguard party, the Revolutionary Army, and a highly centralized state apparatus at the helm of Galician socialism, Rego has transformed what began as a precarious interim presidency into an uncontested mandate. The subsequent vote on the presidency mirrored the constitutional result with seventy-three percent of delegates throwing their support behind Rego, effectively eliminating Quintana’s once-formidable syndicalist bloc from meaningful opposition. The result is not just a victory for Rego, but a formal pivot toward a new ideological framework, Galicia’s flirtation with syndicalist pluralism has given way to the iron discipline of National Bolshevism, with a centralized party, mass nationalization, and a tightly controlled revolutionary project at its core. Rego, now officially President of the Republic, has wasted no time in declaring the opening of a new era of unbroken revolution, one that shall never again be challenged by syndicalists or any other factionalist wings within the Bloc."

idea_gal_divided_revolution:0 "Divided Revolution"
idea_gal_divided_revolution_desc:0 "While Galician nationalism runs deep, many had hoped to avoid violent revolution as a means of achieving Galician self-determination. This division has only been compounded by the fact that the Galician Nationalist Bloc, a socialist alliance, has emerged as the opportunistic leader of this violent uprising, despite the lack of broad popular support. As such, the war remains unpopular, and the People's Party presents an ever-present thorn in the side of the ruling regime."

While not widespread, this tradition of guerrilla warfare has resulted in a number of skilled tacticians prepared to defend Galicia from its historic oppressors."

basque.1.t:0 "Basque Homeland and Liberty Infighting"
basque.1.d:0 "While we may have now secured our independence from the insidious grasp of the Castillian menace, and while the newly appointed Prime Minister Arnaldo Otegi may reside over a Republic desperate for his leadership, the ranks of ETA are far from united. Within the halls of power, a power struggle is intensifying as those once united behind Otegi have recognized that now, with independence secured, there exists a chance for the revolution to chart a different course. From the hardliners in the military, who have continued to demand the adoption of a European-style Marxist-Leninist party-state, to the moderates in Herri Batasuna, who dare call for electoral pluralism, the future of our revolution remains far from certain. However, despite this new surge in factionalism, the people of our newly independent Republic are, for the time being, united around the surviving war-time coalition, which has ensured the continued survival of our nation. As long as the wartime coalition can survive, which has encompassed socialism to moderate conservatism, the future of the Basque Country is secure. Yet, with the rise in factionalism within our ranks, perhaps it is only time before the Socialist Party and Basque Nationalists see the futility of our agreement and move to strike an independent course."

basque.2.d:0 "Despite every effort by Prime Minister Otegi to ensure the survival of our coalition that championed Basque independence, our once unified movement has now had the first domino fall. The PSE-EE, previously aligned with Spain's PSOE until the beginning of our war, has formally declared it will seek to distance itself from the coalition and ETA. Arguing that the differences between the two movements are too great for reconciliation, pointing to the growing influence of the hardliners within our ranks, the PSE-EE now seeks to utilize its position outside of government to pressure the Prime Minister to engage in legitimate discussion on democratization, and the abandonment of ETA’s sustained militaristic grip over the Republic. Despite this rejection of the wartime coalition, the PSE-EE has, at least, recognized that it would happily work with Herri Batasuna, arguing it to be the only sensible branch of ETA in a post-independence environment. With this public fallout already sending shockwaves through the Republic, the Prime Minister has been quick to move to secure the backing of the Basque Nationalist Party, hoping to reach its leadership and settle any disputes before they too seek to abandon the successful wartime coalition."

basque.3.d:0 "In another blow to our coalition, Iñigo Urkullu has declared that the Basque Nationalist Party will sever all ties with ETA, denouncing our revolutionary principles as contradictory to the very idea of Basque liberation. Effective immediately, the party has announced an independent course, backing the establishment of a liberal democracy in our newly independent Republic to stand against the supposedly inevitable swap of Spanish rule with a new form of European dominance. This abrupt shift has sent shockwaves through nationalist circles once more, as for a second time in mere days another party has abandoned our leadership pursuing a new type of politics. While accepting the loss of these capitalist pawns, Otegi has been quick to denounce the decision, seeing it as an attempt to play politics with the early days of the Republic before a constitution had been properly drafted. As the first weeks of peace unfold, the question remains whether this rupture will continue to unify the nation under a new democratic order or merely deepen the existing fractures within its nationalist movement. For now, Urkullu has made his choice: demanding that the future of the Basque Country be won not with bullets, but with ballots."

basque.4.d:0 "In a stark challenge to Otegi’s leadership, protesters aligned with the PSE-EE and the Basque Nationalist Party have taken to the streets, demanding immediate democratic elections. Their calls come in the wake of both parties’ declarations that they will no longer submit to ETA’s influence, marking a dramatic shift in the post-independence political order. Chanting slogans denouncing the Prime Minister’s rule as an emerging tyranny, demonstrators have insisted that the time for revolutionary governance has passed and that only free elections can grant legitimacy to the new Basque state. While we have yet to respond formally to this growing annoyance, the unrest has signaled a clear fracture within the nationalist movement, as our former allies now turn against the man who once embodied their struggle. To at least contain any emerging violence, unarmed members of ETA have been instructed to organize themselves near the protests and exercise restraint. While it is unlikely that this protest will lead to anything significant, with Otegi seeing the movement as a mere distraction from the issues facing our new Republic, only time will tell whether these turncoats continue to agitate and divide us or if they will soon see the benefit of restoring our united front.

basque.5.d:0 "The protests against Prime Minister Otegi’s government have now taken on a volatile new dimension, as radicalized Spaniards, primarily from Navarre, have joined the demonstrations, not in pursuit of elections, but in outright opposition to Basque independence. While the PSE-EE and the EAJ continue to push for democratic reforms, these Spanish unionists are calling for full reunification with Spain, tapping into deep linguistic and cultural divides that persist in our newly sovereign nation. With nearly half of the Republic's population not speaking Basque, the presence of these demonstrators threatens to transform a struggle for democracy into a larger identity crisis. If their cause gains traction, it could fracture the nationalist movement, peeling away hispanophone support from the independence project. Thus far, the government has sought to contain the unrest without heavy-handed intervention, wary of escalating tensions further. However, the growing size and ideological breadth of the protests leave our administration at a crossroads. If action is not taken swiftly, what began as a call for elections may soon evolve into a full-scale challenge to the very existence of the state."

basque.6.d:0 "The emergence of Spanish unionists in the ongoing protests has radicalized Jarrai, ETA’s youth organization, into taking direct and violent action, sparking brawls without clear orders from Otegi and other senior leadership. In a catastrophic moment for our nation, the first test delivered onto our Republic has now devolved into street-level clashes, as Jarrai militants are attempting to disrupt the growing presence of Spanish unionists through any means available to them. Within ETA leadership, there is no consensus on how to handle this rogue escalation. Some argue that Jarrai must be reined in immediately, warning that unchecked violence risks delegitimizing the independence movement and reinforcing the very narratives used by these unionists to condemn Basque sovereignty. Others, however, view Jarrai’s actions as a necessary response, an unrestrained force capable of breaking up reactionary demonstrations before they gain further traction among the Basque Country’s hispanophone population. As the protests grow increasingly chaotic, the question now facing the government is whether to distance itself from Jarrai’s militant response or tacitly allow their intervention to serve as an unspoken deterrent against those who would see the Basque nation undone."

By distancing ourselves from rash and unsanctioned street violence, we have reinforced our commitment to legitimacy and democratic order. However, this calculated move has come at a cost. Jarrai, feeling betrayed by what they see as our abandonment of revolutionary principles, has grown increasingly distant and embittered. Their frustration has now culminated in a dramatic and public declaration: they will no longer operate under ETA’s banner. Instead, they have proclaimed themselves an independent organization, untethered from the leadership that once guided them. While some within the nationalist movement fear that a leaderless Jarrai could spiral further into unchecked radicalism, others worry that their separation signals the real fracture in ETA. Until Jarrai manages to consolidate itself as a legitimate movement run by an established leader rather than clinging to the belief that they are upholding the revolution, these worries have largely been disavowed as an overreaction that will soon correct itself once the Prime Minister has consolidated control over the streets once more."

basque.8.d:0 "By refusing to condemn Jarrai’s actions, we have made a calculated gamble, one that has, for better or worse, shifted the political landscape in unexpected ways. While we successfully dealt a blow to the unionist movement, the backlash has been swift and profound. The result has been a rare convergence of interests between the unionists and the EAJ, both now united in their shared disdain for the political violence openly wielded by our government. Though Jarrai’s loyalty has been secured, it has come at a significant cost. We have reaffirmed to the Republic what many feared: we remain the same movement we have always been, one willing to resort to violence to achieve our goals. The difference now is that this violence, once aimed at the Castillian tyrants, is now being directed inward against our people and institutions. While our revolutionary zeal remains undiminished, it has become clear that our approach may alienate even some of our most loyal supporters, leaving us to wonder whether the price of unity with Jarrai will ultimately fracture what little support is left for our movement outside of ETA circles, and if our support will ultimately be what forces our movement from power."

basque.9.d:0 "As tensions continue to escalate across the country, the growing discontent with Otegi’s inaction has begun to strain the once thought of unshakable unity within ETA. His failure to address the mounting crises has not gone unnoticed, particularly within his own military faction, which has started to openly question his leadership. With unrest simmering on the streets and political fractures deepening, these hardliners, led by Juan Carlos Ramos, are increasingly pressuring their once beloved leader to take decisive action, warning him that time is running out. The internal divisions are now impossible to ignore. While Otegi’s political faction continues to champion diplomacy and a gradual transition towards stability, the military wing, long accustomed to direct confrontation, sees this as a dangerous path to irrelevance. They argue that without swift and forceful intervention, the state’s resolve will harden, leaving ETA marginalized in a rapidly changing political landscape. Having survived the ordeal with Jarrai, Ortegi now finds himself beginning a dangerous battle with his own party, having spent years ensuring their cohabitation, it seems as though the careful unity of ETA is now beginning to unravel, with there seeming nothing Otegi can do that would satisfy the protestors, unionists, and his own movement."

The Republic is slowly unraveling, and his silence is no longer an option. The weight of the nation’s fate rests squarely on his shoulders. While having attempted to avoid such a choice so soon before the nation was ready, the nation can no longer wait and a choice must be made if the Republic is not to succumb to chaos. While he could resign, surrendering power to the political-military wing of ETA and in doing so capitulate to the hardliners who demand a return to the old ways, this would be a tacit admission of failure. However, it may restore internal cohesion within ETA at the cost of alienating the wider populace. Alternatively, plans have steadily been drafted for the implementation of a democratic system, and while incomplete, capitulating to the demands of the protestors may undercut the support of the EAJ and PSE-EE once the time comes for the elections. However, despite the mounting pressure, there is nothing official demanding the resignation of Otegi, and with the backing of the military wing of ETA, he could simply choose to remain in power."

basque.11.d:0 "Following Prime Minister Otegi’s decision to resign, the political landscape of the Republic has shifted. With the moderate factions sidelined, ETA’s Political-Military branch, now the dominant force under the leadership of Juan Carlos Ramos, has seized control, consolidating the movement’s hardline Marxist-Leninist faction into the country’s new ruling power. Ramos, having successfully united the hardliners and the remnants of ETA under his leadership, has made his position clear: there will be no concessions to the democratic protesters. Dismissing their demands as reactionary and their movement as infiltrated by crypto-fascists, he has refused to entertain the notion of elections, positioning himself as the final bulwark against what he sees as an imperialist counter-revolution. But rather than crushing the democratic opposition, Ramos’ intransigence has only fueled its fire. Rejecting the regime’s accusations, the protest movement has redoubled its efforts, rallying the disillusioned and calling for mass mobilization against the new government. Demonstrators now openly denounce Ramos as a tyrant, drawing comparisons between his rule and the European socialist states he claims to despise. With the Republic at a breaking point, the struggle between revolution and democracy has reached its most dangerous phase."

Weeks of street clashes, once confined to scuffles and threats, have now erupted into something far more severe, as the streets now run red with the blood of both unionists and nationalists. The first deaths of this struggle have sent shockwaves through the Republic, raising urgent questions about our role in the spiraling unrest. In response, some within our ranks have argued that the Prime Minister must immediately rein Jarrai in, requesting their actions be more closely monitored to prevent further chaos. The risk, they warn, is not just to the movement’s legitimacy but to Jarrai itself, as unchecked violence could turn them from a feared vanguard into an uncontrollable liability. Yet others see no reason to temper their fury. Is Jarrai, not the hammer with which we shall break the Spanish resistance once and for all? If the unionists wish to fight for the soul of this nation, then let them taste the full weight of its defenders."

What began as street clashes has now evolved into open warfare, as Jarrai militants, emboldened by their mandate, have taken their fight to the heart of the unionist resistance. The latest skirmishes have left entire districts scarred, their meeting places set ablaze by Molotov cocktails. Dozens have already perished in the flames, many more lie wounded, and yet the fires continue to burn, each one a signal to those who still dream of reunification with Spain. With the violence continuing in the streets, where fistfights have become a common occurrence, there has now grown a worrying source of conflict among ETA. Despite our successes, which have continued to impose significant strain on the organizational efforts of the reactionaries, some have begun to whisper that this violence risks consuming us, that we are forging a state not through justice but through vengeance.

Troops have rolled into major urban centers, with Bilbao seeing the heaviest deployment, their arrival signaling an end, not to the chaos, but to any illusion of neutrality. What followed was not the swift imposition of peace that many had expected, but a massacre. The military crackdown has already claimed more lives than the so-called glorified gang fights that preceded it, with scores of dead now littering the streets of our capital, yet the casualties tell a story of their own. None among the dead belong to Jarrai. The soldiers’ bullets have found only unionists and protesters, a fact so blatant it hardly requires acknowledgment. There is no pretension of even-handedness, no careful balancing act to maintain a veneer of legitimacy. This is power exercised in its rawest form. Perhaps some among the people still clung to the belief that the military served the Republic rather than its ruler. If so, today has dispelled any lingering doubt, however, given our recent rhetoric, surely, by now, they knew better."

Standing before the press, their leaders did not mince words, branding Ramos the architect of a red terror so ruthless it would make Dzerzhinsky himself blush. The message was clear: this was not a revolution but a descent into unchecked tyranny. With this declaration, the so-called socialists have made their choice: they have turned their backs on the Republic, aligning themselves with those who would see it undone. There is no neutrality left in this conflict, no room for half-measures. By condemning Ramos, they have betrayed our revolution. For now, they remain untouched, their defiance confined to their protests on the streets and the hurried printing of posters that displayed the faces of those lost and newspapers branding the Prime Minister as the Butcher of Bilbao. But history does not look kindly upon traitors, and the Republic has a long memory. In time, these social fascists shall meet their end, and their betrayal shall be met with the utmost retribution."

The Prime Minister’s word is evidence enough, those within the party ranks are not mere dissenters, but traitors in league with the fascist unionists. The raids have unfolded with cold efficiency. Doors have been broken down in the dead of night, offices ransacked, and members dragged from their homes, their protests drowned out by a swift beating. As ordered by the Prime Minister, there will be no trials, no hearings, and these fascists will disappear from the light of day. The Socialist Party had its chance to stand with the Republic, and instead, it chose the side of reaction. Now, it is being erased.

With ETA and Jarrai stretched thin across the country, the revolution’s very survival hangs in the balance. The high command, caught off guard by the scale of the uprising, has scrambled to formulate a response. Two plans have been hastily drafted, each carrying immense risk. The first calls for sheer force, every able-bodied man, every rifle, every bullet thrown into a full-frontal confrontation. A test of endurance, one that would see our forces grind down the social fascists in brutal street-by-street combat. The second, more daring, seeks to divide our forces into two groups, executing a swift encirclement to crush the enemy from both sides. It is a gamble, one that would leave the forward line dangerously exposed. However if successful, the PSE-EE could be eradicated in a single stroke.

The PSE-EE’s final gamble has collapsed beneath the sheer force of our ranks. Their so-called revolutionaries, unionists, traitors, and social fascists are either dead, scattered or too broken to fight. No longer will they darken the halls of power, no longer will they threaten the independence we bled for. At last, the work of the revolution is complete. Prime Minister Ramos has done what Otegi would not: he has secured our freedom, crushed dissent beneath the weight of history, and carved a future in which the Republic stands unchallenged.

But the terror they once wielded with impunity has now come full circle when their second group moved to complete the maneuver; it was not the enemy they met, but the people themselves. Tired of fear, weary of bloodshed, the residents of Bilbao poured into the streets, blocking the advance. This was no orchestrated uprising, no planned resistance, this was a city refusing to be ruled by force any longer. When ETA forces tried to push forward, the mob descended, armed not with rifles but with sheer rage. Outnumbered and isolated, the encirclement collapsed before it could begin. As the battle for the Prime Minister’s office raged on, it became evident that ETA forces were no match for the continued advance of the PSE-EE. Overwhelmed and cornered, Prime Minister Ramos was captured. His final order was not one of defiance but surrender, ETA is to stand down across the Republic to accept that their rule is over.

Therefore, effective immediately, the political wing of ETA has been ordered, not to crush Jarrai outright but to ensure that its leadership would never have the opportunity to corrupt the revolution. A reorganization here, a subtle adjustment to a ballot there, a well-placed whisper of blackmail where necessary, each move executed with the precision of a scalpel, not the recklessness of a blade. Ekaitz Sirvent, Garazi Rodríguez, and Euken Villasante, once rising stars, now fading embers.

With their leadership carefully dismantled before they could rally resistance, no coordinated opposition to our withdrawal of support has emerged. What remains of Jarrai now operates under the quiet understanding that their survival depends on their obedience. They are still ours, still a part of the revolutionary cause, but only within the limits we set. As expected, despite this new understanding come to with Jarrai, true peace remains distant.

Although the Prime Minister and his cabinet remain firm in their refusal to entertain demands from the EAJ, PSE-EE, or unionists, the persistence of these demonstrations raises pressing questions over long-term stability. Officials within the government have begun to explore potential strategies to contain the movement before it gains further traction, with several even suggesting that we revert course on our decision to undermine Jarrai, formally letting loose our dogs of war once more. However, as expected, Prime Minister Ramos has refused to sanction this action now that peace has begun to be restored. The challenge of finding peace, therefore continues and lies in striking a balance, offering enough to pacify moderate demonstrators while ensuring that the fundamental authority of the state remains unchallenged.

The PSE-EE’s initial departure was driven by fundamental objections to our authoritarian methods, particularly our use of political violence to consolidate power. However, with the suppression of Jarrai and a renewed emphasis on stability, Ramos is now positioning his administration as one willing to adapt, if not fully reform. Whether the PSE-EE interprets this as genuine change or merely a tactical maneuver remains to be seen. As negotiations commence, the balance of power hangs in the hands of the Prime Minister. A successful renewal of the coalition could provide much-needed legitimacy to his government.

While the accord stops short of committing to general elections, it has been broadly accepted that Madariaga’s leadership, backed by the PSE-EE, will continue to guide the Republic toward democratic reform. This tentative step toward pluralism has been met with a mix of relief and frustration. Within ETA, the decision has stirred discontent among hardliners who view it as an unacceptable compromise with social fascists. However, the political calculus appears clear: by securing the Socialists' cooperation, the government has successfully dismantled the most vocal pillar of the democratic protest movement, reunified the socialist movements of the Republic, and restored a fragile order.

Despite ideological fissures within ETA, Otegi has managed, only through careful concessions, to secure a tentative agreement: before addressing broader demands for political liberalization, the immediate priority must be restoring order on the streets. This commitment, however uneasy, marks the first step toward consolidating control over a Republic still teetering on the edge of chaos. While Ramos remains skeptical of any compromise that veers toward democratic reform, and Madariaga pushes for a long-term transition, the agreement signals a temporary ceasefire in ETA’s internal divisions.

Juan Carlos Ramos, though denied a full-scale crackdown, has been partially appeased as security forces redouble efforts to neutralize the most violent elements within the demonstrations. The message is clear, any and all violence will be met with swift and uncompromising force. Protestors aligned with the PSE-EE and EAJ, initially emboldened by weeks of unrest, have begun to recalibrate their approach, wary of provoking a direct confrontation with the military and ETA’s operatives. While isolated clashes continue, particularly with Spanish unionists who still refuse to accept the fact that they, like all others under our flag, are no longer Spanish citizens, seemingly still unwilling to accept the Republic’s new reality, these incidents have largely been contained.

Despite the effort, skepticism lingers. Unlike previous coalition talks, this meeting is set to take place without Herri Batasuna’s direct involvement, a concession that has unsettled some within ETA’s political wing. While Otegi has pledged to advocate for their interests, the decision to exclude Madariaga from negotiations has raised concerns over whether the Prime Minister intends to prioritize realpolitik over ideological purity. Nonetheless, despite this worrying caveat to the now ongoing negotiations, there has been little reason for Madariaga to believe that the Prime Minister will do anything that will intentionally undermine the renewed unity seen among ETA over the last few weeks. However, given the existing tensions between them, only time and words will prove if anything can be achieved towards the restoration of the wartime coalition."

How long this fragile alliance will endure remains an open question. The Socialists have made clear that their cooperation hinges on tangible democratic reforms, a prospect that still unsettles hardliners within ETA. Any sign of hesitation from Otegi could quickly unravel the agreement, reigniting tensions that had only just begun to subside. For now, however, the political horizon appears momentarily steadied. The specter of continued unrest lingers, but with the coalition revived, at least in part, the Republic has been given a brief reprieve from the chaos that has gripped it for weeks.

basque.29.d:0 "A troubling yet unsurprising discovery has now been uncovered as ETA reconnaissance units along the Spanish border have found evidence of sustained material support flowing to the Spanish unionists. Financial aid, food supplies, and perhaps even manpower, have quietly crossed into the Republic, fueling the resistance to our independence. The precise duration of this operation remains unknown, but its implications are deeply unsettling, our borders, once thought secure, have been compromised. Though whispers of Spanish interference had long circulated, confirmation of direct assistance to the unionists presents a stark challenge to our authority. With Madrid’s involvement now an undeniable reality, pressure will mount on Prime Minister Otegi to act decisively. Hardliners have already begun to demand immediate countermeasures, suggesting the borders be lined with soldiers to prevent the arrival of this aid. Moderates however have questioned the necessity of such a move, given that we can easily defeat the unionists in a protracted battle for legitimacy. For now, however, we cannot allow the Spanish to know we know of their meddling, or else we risk either further, more direct involvement, along with undermining our efforts to infiltrate the unionists.

basque.30.d:0 "In a calculated move to stabilize the Republic, Prime Minister Otegi has now extended an invitation to the EAJ leadership for negotiations in Bilbao. Unlike the Socialists, whose ideological proximity to Herri Batasuna allowed for a fragile accord, the Basque Nationalists remain a force apart, pragmatic, wary, and deeply skeptical of our governance. The initiative, largely driven by Julen Madariaga, stems from a strategic imperative rather than ideological alignment. Though openly dismissive of the EAJ’s political vision, Madariaga sees their cooperation as a necessary condition for ending the unrest that continues to simmer in the streets. Yet, given their conservative allegiances and flirtations with the Spanish unionists, there is significant doubt that these negotiations shall make any headway. Recognizing the complexities of these negotiations, Madariaga has already urged a broader approach. The inclusion of both himself and PSE-EE leader Patxi López in the talks could lend credibility to the discussions, ensuring Otegi does not face the EAJ’s leadership alone. However, with longstanding grievances and political ambitions at play, it remains uncertain whether even a carefully orchestrated diplomatic effort will be enough to bring the EAJ into the fold."

The unprecedented meeting, framed as a turning point for the Republic, sought to convince the EAJ that ETA’s leadership is committed to both stabilizing the nation and laying the groundwork for democratization. While no formal agreement has yet been signed, the EAJ’s decision to de-escalate signals a tentative willingness to engage with Otegi’s government. For now, the streets are quieting, and the specter of further violence appears to have subsided. Yet, this fragile peace is entirely conditional, resting on Otegi’s ability to prove that his words were more than mere political theater. Should we fail to make concrete steps toward political reform, the EAJ’s withdrawal from the talks, and a resurgence of mass demonstrations, remains an inevitability. With trust in short supply and past betrayals still fresh, Otegi’s next steps will determine whether this moment is remembered as the Republic’s turning point or the calm before an even greater storm."

The breakdown has sent shockwaves through our fragile political landscape, undoing hopes of securing a broad coalition to stabilize the nation. Urkullu, now emboldened by the failure of talks, has returned to his party with renewed resolve, vowing to intensify street protests and mobilize support until Otegi resigns and a free democratic system is enshrined. The EAJ’s refusal to stand down places the Prime Minister in a precarious position; having secured peace with the PSE-EE, we now face an even more determined nationalist opposition that sees our government as little more than an extension of ETA’s political dominance. The Republic, momentarily quiet, is now poised for further unrest. Preparing for such confrontation, Prime Minister Otegi has now called upon ETA to ready itself for any possibility from the EAJ, with both wings of the political wings of ETA recognizing that the failure of these talks signals, perhaps, the turning point in the history of our young Republic."

The assassin, cut down by return fire before he could be interrogated, carried with him proof of what we long suspected, Madrid’s hand in arming the enemies of our revolution. The timing of this attack is no coincidence, coming just as our government has begun to pacify internal opposition and stabilize the Republic. Although it had previously been assumed that the Spanish were merely smuggling financial aid, people, and food across the border, it was not anticipated that any arms were being sent, leading to the question of how much firepower had been smuggled through unnoticed. Regardless of such questions, the sudden assault on our military is a clear warning, a calculated attempt to remind us that our enemies will not rest until our independence is erased. With the military now on high alert, and ETA forces doubling their patrols on the streets, only time will tell whether this incident will soon be replicated across the Republic, and if Spanish hands seek to strangle our freedom once more."

Despite the ferocity of our soldiers, the unionists have pushed deep into the city, their numbers threatening to overwhelm us. The military, recognizing the existential threat, has made a desperate request demanding Prime Minister Otegi authorize artillery strikes within our capital. A strategy that could break the unionists once and for all, yet one that would leave us ruling over rubble and ash and obliterating the legitimacy we have painstakingly built, the fragile peace with the renewed wartime coalition. Yet, to hold the line without artillery means trusting that our soldiers alone can repel the advancing horde. It means rationing bullets, fortifying every street corner, and bracing for the long fight ahead. If we endure, if we withstand this siege, then perhaps our Republic can emerge from this war with its soul intact. Prime Minister Otegi stands at the precipice, faced with an impossible choice: to save the city by destroying it or to gamble everything on the strength of his army."

Through sheer determination, our military held firm, each soldier knowing that failure meant the end of our Republic. With fresh ammunition flowing in and strategic defenses tightened, our forces turned the tide, grinding down the unionists in a battle of attrition they could not sustain. Their leadership now lies dead among the rubble, their movement shattered. The nightmare of counter-revolution has been extinguished. However, as always, victory comes at a cost. The streets of Bilbao are littered with the scars of battle, its people shaken by the violence that has once again engulfed them. With the dust now beginning to settle, Madrid will no doubt be watching with eager eyes to see our next moves, to attempt to influence us once more, ever hoping that our weakness will provide them with an opportunity.

However, their timing, once again, is intentionally controversial. Bilbao still smolders, its streets washed in blood and littered with the scars of war. Thousands remain in mourning, too fearful to venture out into a city that only days ago was a battlefield. To suggest that democracy can be restored while the wounds of war are still open is either naive or opportunistic. However, the EAJ is no longer merely asking, its leadership has now seemingly grown a spine, and is threatening our nation, our government, and our restored peace. Their members are mobilizing once more, their so-called peaceful protests growing ever more radicalized, seemingly ready to march on Bilbao and hold a final peaceful protest.

Hoping to maintain control, ETA has embarked on a fierce campaign, presenting themselves as the champions of Basque independence and the defenders of the revolution. Yet their message has been swiftly countered by the EAJ, who accuse ETA of dragging their feet on democratization out of fear of losing power, urging voters to remain cautious of ETA’s continued influence. Meanwhile, the PSE-EE has positioned itself as the moderate alternative to the radicalism that has defined Otegi’s government, steadily siphoning support from those unwilling to commit to ETA’s uncompromising stance.

Citing the chaos brought by the unionists in Bilbao as proof of the dangers posed by reactionary forces, Otegi has ordered the immediate outlawing of the EAJ and authorized a sweeping crackdown to dismantle its leadership and militant base. ETA militants, alongside the police, have surged across the Republic, raiding known EAJ strongholds and apprehending its most prominent figures. In a wave of arrests and purges, the once-influential nationalist movement is being methodically dismantled, and its influence extinguished. Just days ago, public support for such drastic measures would have been unthinkable. However, the brutality witnessed on the streets of Bilbao has hardened the resolve of the populace, uniting them behind Otegi's leadership and their desire for lasting stability.

The heart of our Republic, the cradle of our revolution, has fallen into enemy hands. The artillery, once primed to break the back of the insurgency, now sits silent as chaos consumes the city. But worse still, Prime Minister Otegi, along with several high-ranking officials, have been taken hostage.

With Otegi still held in custody within Bilbao as a guarantee of their submission, the government of ETA has now been deposed. The revolution, once thought unbreakable, has been shattered in the streets of its capital. In its place, a new leader and vision has risen, Enrique Rodríguez Galindo, a hardened Civil Guard commander who has spent his life waging war against ETA, has now been sworn in as the interim Prime Minister of the Basque Country and Navarra.

In towns and cities across the Republic, disparate movements have surged into the open, not as coordinated fronts, but as spontaneous bursts of anger, disillusionment, and grief. These are not the polished rallies of political opposition, but the raw outcry of a people stripped suddenly of the revolution they had been told was theirs. While security forces have, so far, been able to isolate and suppress many of these disturbances before they spiral out of control, several demonstrations have erupted into full-scale riots. The scale and ferocity of some have caught the administration off-guard, suggesting that the consolidation of power on paper is not yet matched by true legitimacy on the ground.

Initial police deployments managed to form a perimeter around the advancing nationalists, halting their progress at the city’s outskirts. However, that defensive line has now crumbled under sustained pressure. The EAJ forces, armed, emboldened, and swelling in number, have breached the inner boroughs and begun a slow, grinding advance toward the governmental quarter, mirroring the very scenes that ousted ETA only days ago. In response, police and auxiliary units have been granted full discretion to repel the advance, with tear gas, rubber bullets, and live ammunition now being deployed in an effort to drive back the insurgents.

The streets of Bilbao once again bear the scars of political fanaticism, littered with the bodies of the fallen. Dozens of nationalist fighters now lie dead, their blood soaking the same pavements they had once promised to liberate. Their push was desperate, a final, flailing act of defiance, and in the end, it has served only to reaffirm the futility of opposition. Such a decisive victory that has not only secured our control over Bilbao but the entirety of the Republic has now sent a clear message that any further attempts to dislodge this government, any illusions of reclaiming what was lost, will meet the same fate, death or irrelevance.

Despite initially holding the line, within hours, Bilbao was once again a battleground, and this time, the balance shifted. Police units loyal to Prime Minister Galindo crumbled under the sustained pressure. Barricades fell one by one as EAJ forces swept through the streets, pushing deep into the capital and eventually storming key government buildings. By nightfall, Galindo was in custody, and his administration was formally dissolved by the insurgents. With little resistance remaining and widespread public celebration in the wake of the victory, the Republic has once again changed hands.

Many argue that elections should proceed with only ETA on the ballot, believing that any opening to rival factions, particularly those who once doubted our path to independence, could weaken the unity we fought to establish. Pointing to the incomplete constitution, which, crucially, does not mandate a multiparty system, the Hardliners have insisted that the structure of the electoral process rests entirely at the discretion of the Prime Minister, hoping that he will follow in the example of Soviet democracy and ensure that the vanguard can and will lead, now and forever.

Even the People's Union, a staunchly unionist voice, has begun to whisper in the ears of the people, questioning whether independence will truly offer prosperity.

Despite their frustration, Otegi has remained resolute. While acknowledging the emotional weight of the EAJ’s appeal, he has rejected their demands outright, insisting that the result must be respected regardless of its implications. To reverse course now, he has said, would be to betray the very democratic principles on which the Republic was founded."
basque.52.o1:0 "Democracy has been our undoing, but Otegi remains a man of his word"

basque.53.t:0 "ETA Announces Official Disarmament"
basque.53.d:0 "Continuing to honor his commitment to a peaceful transfer of power, Prime Minister Otegi has issued a sweeping decree ordering the immediate disarmament of all wings of ETA. In a decisive move to formally end the militant phase of Basque independence, Otegi has called for the retirement of key generals, the closure of ETA military operations, and the transfer of remaining authority to the police and formal military institutions of the Republic. Initial resistance was fierce. Several hardline commanders denounced the order as a betrayal, insisting they would never lay down arms while the threat of Madrid’s return lingered. But Otegi, meeting personally with these groups over the last twenty-four hours, is understood to have appealed to their sense of duty, reminding them of the cost already paid in lives and the danger of reigniting a war that the Republic no longer has the will or numbers to fight. Though the disarmament process remains ongoing, the bulk of ETA’s structure has now been dismantled, with arms depots secured and remaining commanders stood down. For the first time since the Republic’s founding, the specter of ETA has begun to fade, not through defeat, but by decree."
basque.53.o1:0 "Let history be our judge"

basque.54.t:0 "Spanish Unionists Take Office"
basque.54.d:0 "With ETA now effectively disarmed and the opposition gradually coming to terms with the new political order, Prime Minister Otegi has officially tendered his resignation. In a solemn address to parliament, he declared that he had fulfilled his final duty, ensuring the will of the people was respected and that democracy, however fragile, could begin to take root in the Basque Country without further bloodshed. The moment, though expected, marks the end of an era. For years, Otegi had been the face of the independence struggle, at once its architect, its defender, and its most controversial figure. Now, with his departure, he leaves behind a fractured Republic, a disarmed movement, and a nation unsure of what future lies ahead. Javier Esparza, the leader of the People's Union and architect of the recent electoral upset, has officially assumed the office of Prime Minister. With him comes a vision starkly different from that of his predecessor, one aligned with reintegration, reconciliation, and the restoration of ties with Madrid. Whether the Republic can endure, or whether it will soon be folded back into Spain’s embrace, now rests in Esparza’s hands."
basque.54.o1:0 "We shall soon return to Madrid’s loving embrace"

basque.55.t:0 "Jarrai Refuses Disarmament"
basque.55.d:0 "Despite Prime Minister Otegi’s formal decree ordering the disarmament of all ETA factions and the peaceful transition of power, a sudden and violent resurgence has shattered hopes for a quiet end to the Republic’s revolutionary chapter. Jarrai, which only recently severed ties with ETA in protest of electoral politics, has now outright refused to comply. Declaring the disarmament a betrayal of everything fought for, the group has launched coordinated attacks on military and Civil Guard stock houses across the region, reigniting conflict in the heart of Euskadi. The situation has been further complicated by growing unrest within the armed forces themselves. A number of prominent generals, previously reported to have stood down following Otegi’s order, have now resurfaced in open defiance. Among them is Juan Carlos Ramos, long a hardliner within ETA’s military command, who is believed to have resumed his position and aligned himself with Jarrai’s effort to preserve the Republic from within. While Otegi remains Prime Minister, it is now clear that his grip on the situation is slipping, as an organization once thought to be nothing more than a small handful of radical youths is now turning into the new national movement of Basque independence."
basque.55.o1:0 "What are they doing?"

basque.56.t:0 "Jarrai Overthrows Unionist Government"
basque.56.d:0 "With Jarrai continuing to amass support from across the Republic, including from unlikely quarters once skeptical of ETA’s brand of socialism, Prime Minister Otegi has now been forced out of office. The final blow came as armed factions loyal to Jarrai entered Bilbao virtually unopposed, cheered on by crowds who lined the streets and welcomed the returning ETA soldiers as liberators. What began as a fringe youth movement that once undermined our independence through continued assaults against the local Spanish community, has now become the uncontested vanguard of a new revolutionary wave. Forcing the resisting ETA government to resign at gunpoint, assurances have been given regarding Otegi’s safety, however, the same cannot be said for the leadership of the People's Union. Denounced as collaborators and traitors, key party figures have been arrested and imprisoned for their attempts to restore Spanish rule and dismantle the foundations of Basque sovereignty. With Jarrai’s decentralized leadership now assuming command, the structures of power are being rapidly overhauled. In place of traditional governance, revolutionary committees have begun to form, and with them, the first signs of a sweeping purge targeting suspected unionists and counter-revolutionaries. The Republic has been reborn, not in negotiation or reform, but in the hands of its youth, who vow to defend Euskadi with fire if necessary."
basque.56.o1:0 "Euskadi will live free or die!"

basque.59.t:0 "Basque Nationalist Party Leadership Contest"
basque.59.d:0 "After months of instability, violence, and sacrifice, the Basque Nationalist Party has achieved leadership of the country. However, even in triumph, cracks within the party have begun to surface, revealing a bitter struggle for the office of Prime Minister. Since independence, Iñigo Urkullu has served as the official head of the EAJ, steering the party towards moderation, compromise, and an enduring commitment to democracy. Yet, this approach has now come under fire from a growing faction within the party, led by Iñaki Anasagasti. Anasagasti, emboldened by the the party's position of paramount power, has challenged Urkullu’s leadership, condemning his willingness to work with socialists and declaring that the turmoil of recent months demonstrate a need for committed and unwavering leadership. Seeking to rally the right and revive traditional values, he has gone as far as to reach out to the isolated Carlist movement, hoping to secure their backing and tilt the party in his favor. As the EAJ faces an internal reckoning, the battle for the premiership will shape the party’s, and the Republic’s, future."

He has, like Anasagasti, long been a fan of both Basque and Catalan nationalism, despite being neither Basque nor Catalan himself. He is, however, a polyglot, speaking German, Romanian, Italian, Spanish, Basque, Catalan, and English. Also, to be fair, most monarchs aren't the same ethnicity as the people they rule over.

basque.94.d:0 "With the Basque country's conquest of and unification of east iberia complete, the tensions between the old guard of the basque nationalist party and the increasingly dominant monarchists have grown to a fever pitch. Iñigo Urkullu has left the Basque Nationalist Party, and gone with other liberal-conservative republicans to form the Christian Democratic Republican Party. It's a big tent party meant to attract Christian Democrats and republicans and proponents of liberal democracy. With this exodus from the party, the Basque Nationalist Party is effectively dead. Regardless, it's not a great name for a party that now governs a multinational region. So, the monarchist wing of the EAJ-PNV has decided to rename itself to the Carlist Party"

So Jarrai is going to purge a bunch of ETA members, solidifying Jarrai's control over the state and keeping the organizations old guard far away from power and responsibility. Some are being killed, some aren't. But yeah, no one with any kind of political, economic, or military experience is really gonna be left."

idea_bsq_revolutionary_solidarity_desc:0 "With the war for Basque independence begun, the time for bickering and factionalism is over. Basque Homeland and Liberty, better known as ETA, has formed an uneasy alliance with the Basque branch of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party and with the more right-wing oriented Basque Nationalist organizations. For how long this alignment of former rivals will last is anyone's guess, but for now they stand together to secure Basque independence from Spain."

This paramilitary group has waged a guerrilla war against Spain for decades, and adheres to an ideology that synthesizes militarism, socialism, and Basque nationhood. However, not everyone in the country is pleased with being ruled by a militant, extremist political organization. Opposition to the current regime runs deep, especially among the country's Spanish speakers, and ETA itself is subject to bitter factional division."

idea_cat_beating_heart_of_iberian_industry_desc:0 "For almost two centuries, Catalonia has been the centre of industrialisation in the Iberian peninsula, being termed 'Spain's factory', reflecting its high levels of output. This has made the region quite wealthy, especially compared with the other regions of the country. This industrial bounty has, however, also led to Catalonia becoming a hotbed of labour militancy, and as history has showed, even radical trade unionism, with Revolutionary Catalonia being the first anarcho-syndicalist society in human history. Despite the decades gone by since the end of the Spanish Civil War, the Spanish state was never quite able to quell the embers of revolution within it. Now, with the Catalan War of Independence having begun, the CNT-FAI have once more made its move, pledging itself and the plentiful industries of Catalonia to the separatist cause. Now, the factory of Spain is being turned against it, and the separatists are hoping that this may be their trump card."
idea_cat_francoist_law_enforcement_desc:0 "When the Mossos d'Esquadra went into exile at the end of the Spanish Civil War, the new Francoist government instead ended centuries of independent Catalan law enforcement, and put the Guardia Civil, loyal to the Francoist government, in charge of enforcing the laws of the Spanish state upon Catalonia. This state of affairs continued until recently, when one of the first acts of the Puigdemont government in the War of Independence was to dissolve the Guardia Civil in Catalonia. The realities of war demanded that most forces to be sent to the front, however, and as such independent Catalonia has had to rely upon the self-same Municipal Police that served under the Juan Carlos regime. While these have appeared loyal, and dutifully if not cheerfully fulfil their duties, some in government wonder where their true loyalties lie, especially as former Guardia Civil men keep popping up among their ranks."
