  ALA_Final_Frontier:0 "The Final Frontier"
  ALA_Final_Frontier_desc:0 "Alaska sits on the furthest frontier of the American Continent, with the northernmost parts of the country crossing the Arctic Circle. Due to the climate of the country, agriculture is extremely limited and cost of living remains high, as most needs have to be imported from outside sources.\n\nStill, Alaska remains unique as one of the few places in America still not completely conquered by man, and while the untouched beauty of the Boreal frontier draws tourists, it also brings a myriad of logistical and technological challenges."
  ALA_Perfidious_Canucks:0 "Perfidious Ottawa"
  ALA_Perfidious_Canucks_desc:0 "Alaska was unceremoniously broken off from the Union following the Dissolution of the United States and almost immediately fell into a humanitarian crisis. Even while a US State, Alaska was heavily reliant on imports of food, electronics and daily necessities. Now, with supply lines disrupted and the economy in shambles, Alaska was teetering on the edge of a full blown famine.\n\nCanada, either out of concern or opportunism depending on who you ask, chose to intervene and offer their economic and humanitarian support. Alaska became heavily dependent on the support of the Canadian government, and in exchange Canada acquired a certain degree of unspoken economic and by extension political control over the country. This state of affairs has kept Alaska from starving, but some feel it has instead robbed Alaska of her sovereignty as a nation. Other more radical voices push for the idea of §RAnnexationism§!, the idea that Alaska should pursue further integration with Canada, potentially even opting to become the country's eleventh province."
  ALA_Oil_Pipeline:0 "Boreal Black Gold"
  ALA_Oil_Pipeline_desc:0 "Alaska sits atop substantial natural resources in both crude oil and natural gas and thanks to the pre-Dissolution United States, it has the means to access and exploit it. The Trans-Alaskan Pipeline, while nowhere near as productive as concerns in the continental states, can pump hundreds of thousands of gallons of crude oil across the country.\n\nThis has, ironically, been both Alaska's boon and curse. While oil has brought wealth to some parts of the country, the importance of the pipeline has also brought foreign meddling. The Canadian government, as part of their agreements with Alaska, maintains a significant share of stock in the Alaskan National Energy Corporation, a state-run conglomerate created to manage oil and natural gas. This, coupled with Canada's already extensive economic and political influence, have become a major point of contention between Ottawa and Anchorage."
  ALA_Voglers_Dream:0 "Vogler's Dream"
  ALA_Voglers_Dream_desc:0 "'I'm an Alaskan, not an American. I've got no use for America or her damned institutions.'\n\n these words have echoed in the hearts of every Alaskan something, Vogler got to see his dream come true and was buried on Alaskan Soil something, Alaska has a strong national identity something."

  alaska.1.t:0 "The Ice-Cold Republic"
  alaska.1.d:0 "Originally purchased off the Russians for the cheap, Alaska was long dubbed as 'Seward's Folly', a useless and barren mess of ice and snow; until of course, Alaska proved its worth. Gold, Silver, Copper and Petroleum were all found in spades on the lands of our icy frontier, and suddenly, everyone in this state praised the heavens that Seward was dumb enough to buy this worthless chunk of ice. Despite the riches provided to America by the Last Frontier, America's relationship with Alaska remained as cold as our barren plains. Denied representation until 1951, a general feeling emerged within Alaska that they'd be better off alone.\n\n This feeling culminated in the creation of the Alaska Independence Party by Joseph Vogler, a movement dedicated to the foundation of an independent Alaskan nation, and one of the few successful separatist movements in the pre-collapse United States. The AKIP's success led to Alaska being the first nation to break off the United States, with the Joe Vogler himself famously declaring Alaska's complete independence to a riotous applause in Anchorage. A snap Presidential Election swept Vogler into power with a landslide, with Vogler being among the first leaders of the post-collapse United States to unilaterally reject any attempts at re-unification with America and decisively set their nation on the course of independence. All was not well however, as Alaska would soon find itself isolated and alone; unable to provide for itself after the collapse of their main supplier and trading partner. Luckily, the Canadians graciously stepped in and provided us with the aid we so desperately needed. Unfortunately, this gave the Canadians a great degree of control over Alaskan affairs. Vogler had lived to see his dream of an Independent Alaska come to fruition, and would eventually pass away in 1997; being succeeded by Vice-President Wally Hickel. Hickel would go on to lose the 2002 Election to former Senator Ted Stevens, who toned down much of the AKIP's pro-independence rhetoric, while still acknowledging Alaska's status as an independent nation. While Alaska may not truly be free, we are one of the few nations in the post-collapse United States with lasting political stability and a solid national identity; something which few Post-USA nations can boast about."

  alaska.3.t:0 "Ted Stevens Killed in Plane Crash"
  alaska.3.d:0 "Disturbing news has come out of Dillingham today, detailing the crash of a de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter floatplane near a nearby mountain slope. The plane, which was carrying Alaskan President Ted Stevens, was late to arrive at its intended destination; and after a brief search of the area, our worst fears were confirmed, as the wreckage of the small plane was located near a mountain slope. It is unknown whether this was a deliberate act of terror or a mere accident, with Alaska's Aviation Authority as well as Canada's Transportation Safety Board looking into the potential causes of the accident. The flight was being conducted under visual flight rules and was not monitored by radar at the time of the accident, since there is no such coverage in the area under 4000 feet. Other pilots who had flown in the same area during the course of the day described weather conditions in the region as "very bad". This gives credence to the theory that the crash was merely a freak accident, and not a deliberate assassination. Despite theories, there is still no conclusive cause for the crash, and it seems like the death of one of Alaska's most beloved figures will remain a painful mystery."

  alaska.5.t:0 "Death of Wally Hickel"
  alaska.5.d:0 "Second President of the Republic of Alaska, Walter Joseph Hickel, has died of natural causes today. Before serving as Vice-President and later President of Alaska, Hickel presided over a number of successful business practices, and later served in the administration of President John M. Ashbrook. While more moderate than his mentor Joseph Vogler in regards to his relationship with the former United States, Hickel contributed to a strong sense of Alaskan Individualism, and helped steer the populace away from loyalty to one of the many American claimants. This strong Alaskan Nationalism was a contributing factor to Alaska becoming the first American Breakaway to gain international recognition and join the United Nations\n\n With Hickel dead, leadership of the AKIP has been transferred to influential Native American leader, Doald Rose Wright."
