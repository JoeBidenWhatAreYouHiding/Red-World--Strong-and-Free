 CSD_President_idea:0 "President of [CSD.GetNameDef]"
 CSD_President_idea_desc:0 "The Presidency of Cascadia is an officially apolitical office that serves as Head of State of the Republic. With Cascadia's Constitution modelled off of Canada's, the position of President occupies the position of Governor General or Monarch in the Westminister System, with the bulk of governmental power being vested with the Prime Minister. The Office of President is set for election every six years, with Presidents confined to two terms, even if it is generally understood that Presidents only seek a single term in office. While the President in an official capacity is an apolitical role, the President also has many reserve powers, reserve powers that can possibly cause complications if the President and the Prime Minister are from differing parties, a situation known as 'Cohabitation'.\n\n The Current President is: [CSDGetPresident] [CSDGetPresidentStatus]"

Cities remain smouldering ruins, crops remain burned, and infrastructure stands decimated, all as Cascadians struggle to recover from the War for Independence. While it shall take time, Cascadia shall hopefully soon fully recover from the damage done during the War."

### Events ###

 cascadia.200.t:0 "Presidential Veto Restricted"
 cascadia.200.d:0 "It is understandable why the choice was made to model Cascadia's Constitution on our northern neighbors in Canada instead of the old American one. The United States' collapse, combined with the relative stability of nations such as Canada and the United Kingdom in the aftermath of the victory of Communism has proved a point to many, and while Richardson has no intention of returning Cascadia to the failed systems of pre-1987 America, our stability cannot come at the price of the Prime Minister's authority. With that in mind, all three parties in the Coalition for Freedom have passed new legislation substantially expanding the powers of the Prime Minister's office. Included in these provisions are legislation abolishing the ability of the President to unilaterally veto legislation. Previously, President Kate Brown, who has very much not seen eye-to-eye with Prime Minister Richardson, has utilized her signature to prevent much of the Coalition's agenda from becoming law. Given Richardson's staunch Christian Conservatism and Brown's status as the first openly bisexual office holder within Cascadia, this is no surprise. Under these new terms, the Presidency has very much been reduced to a symbolic position; with a two-thirds majority now required to utilize veto powers."
 cascadia.200.o1:0 "The Prime Minister must remain Paramount."

 cascadia.201.t:0 "Universal Basic Income Introduced"
 cascadia.201.d:0 "Universal Basic Income is a novel proposal. Proponents of this measure have pointed to potential expansions in economic growth and an increased ability for Cascadians to innovate and create without having to dedicate their entire lives to work. Others, especially those within the Conservative Party, have pointed to data suggesting implementing a UBI could crater productivity and lead to widespread unemployment within the country. Proposals for a UBI have previously been dead in the water, with both the Libertarians and Conservatives threatening to torpedo the coalition if such legislation is announced. However a shock breakthrough for UBI proponents came when several members of the Independence Party vocally supported the UBI proposal. With backing from the Greens, the Labour Front, and a keen few within the CIP, the new Universal Basic Income bill has become law, and now lands on the desk of President Kate Brown to sign. As it seems, Conservative and Libertarian threats were all bluster, as the implementation of a UBI already sees an increase in the polls for the Progressive Party. Meanwhile, deficit hawks continue to bemoan the potential costs of such a measure."
 cascadia.201.o1:0 "Wonderful."

 cascadia.202.t:0 "Centralization Measures Introduced"
 cascadia.202.d:0 "Cascadia is in many ways a nation of contradictions. The status of highly-urbanized areas on the coast contrasts radically with the 'Cascadian Heartlands' of the East. The extent of Centralization within Cascadia has always been a hot-button issue, especially to those on the political right. In another move primed to agitate the fellow members of the Coalition for Freedom, Prime Minister Stine has signalled an intent to empower the Federal Government, in stark opposition to those who wish to see local authorities remain paramount. While this action has been devoid of any concrete Legislative action, internal memos from the Stine Government have signalled a dramatic shift when it comes to Federal-Local relations. To some this move harkens back to the forced merger of Washington and Oregon under the Columbian SR during the days of the UAPR, with protesters already calling Stine a Communist for this action. However this move also has its supporters, as many, especially those within the Urban areas in which the Progressive Party thrives, yearn for a stronger Federal Government capable of real change, separate from more stubborn local authorities."
 cascadia.202.o1:0 "Localism has brought nothing but trouble."

 cascadia.203.t:0 "Christianity in Cascadia"
 cascadia.203.d:0 "Faith has unfortunately been lost on much of the Cascadian Populace. From the Hippie-bent of many of Cascadia's denizens to the State Atheism forced upon us by the UAPR occupiers, it seems that the Cascadian Church is in dire straits. Luckily, Prime Minister Walden has attempted to tear down the legacy of Atheism within Cascadia. After a meeting with the Archbishop of Portland, John George Vlazny, and other Religious officials from other faiths such as Judaism and Islam, Walden has announced that new legislation aimed at protecting faith-based institutions shall be tabled. With a commanding majority, the only real obstacle to this new legislation stands as the President, who has already protested this legislation as weakening the bounds between Church and State. Regardless, the facts remain that Religion appears to be on the upswing in Cascadia, as attendance in Churches and Synagogues break records. Already the data shows that the amount of Cascadians attending religious services regularly has risen to 43%, a shocking turnaround from the previous figures."
 cascadia.203.o1:0 "We are a nation of faith."

 cascadia.204.t:0 "International Trade Slows"
 cascadia.204.d:0 "The ports of Seattle and Portland have experienced a lull as of late. This is very much intentional. PM Walden, determined to keep Cascadia safe from the clutches of Environment-Killing Globalism, has signed new legislation dramatically expanding tariffs and import levies on just about every nation on the planet. These measures are meant to encourage the consumption of local, sustainably-made goods, instead of contributing to the destruction of our planet by purchasing goods made in nations with less-then-stellar environmental records. Previous boycotts of non-sustainable products have been done in an unofficial capacity up until now, as Prime Minister Walden has utilized his authority to make these boycotts formal government policy. In order to further protect the environment from the harm of infinite-growth policies, Walden has put forward a formal policy of 'Reduce, Reuse, Recycle', championing more durable and reusable goods instead of the consumer culture that has long plagued the post-United States. While some have protested this option, if we wish to save this planet, then we must learn to live with less."
 cascadia.204.o1:0 "We shall make Reduce, Reuse, Recycle into law."

 cascadia.205.t:0 "Universal Healthcare Implemented"
 cascadia.205.d:0 "A lack of public healthcare options has been one of the most prevalent issues of the Former United States. Cascadia, as of today, is no stranger to a lack of affordable healthcare, with countless Cascadians still being forced to pay outrageous out-of-pocket sums, or in the most horrifying cases, being forced to forgo medical treatment to save money. Prime Minister Franz has declared that no longer shall Cascadians be torn between paying for rent and paying for healthcare. A new model of Universal Healthcare, modelled on the healthcare system of our Northern Neighbors in Canada, has been formally implemented across Cascadia. Implementation is set to be a gradual process as those who can't afford care are transitioned to a public model, but within due time Cascadia's new healthcare system shall hopefully be moving smoothly. While 'Moderates' and Conservatives alike have cautioned against embracing 'Socialized Medicine', declaring this to be step one in a return to UAPR rule, the Labour Front's new healthcare reforms enjoy widespread support among the Cascadian electorate."
 cascadia.205.o1:0 "No longer shall Cascadians have to choose between medicine and healthcare."

 cascadia.206.t:0 "Isolationism Embraced"
 cascadia.206.d:0 "The ports of Seattle and Portland have experienced a lull as of late. This is very much intentional. PM Franz, determined to keep Cascadia safe from the clutches of Environment-Killing Globalism, has signed new legislation dramatically expanding tariffs and import levies on just about every nation on the planet. These measures are meant to encourage the consumption of local, sustainably-made goods, instead of contributing to the destruction of our planet by purchasing goods made in nations with less-then-stellar environmental records. Previous boycotts of non-sustainable products have been done in an unofficial capacity up until now, as Prime Minister Franz has utilized her authority to make these boycotts formal government policy. In order to further protect the environment from the harm of infinite-growth policies, Walden has put forward a formal policy of 'Reduce, Reuse, Recycle', championing more durable and reusable goods instead of the consumer culture that has long plagued the post-United States. While some have protested this option, if we wish to save this planet, then we must learn to live with less."
 cascadia.206.o1:0 "We shall make Reduce, Reuse, Recycle into law."

 cascadia.207.t:0 "Small Business Embraced"
 cascadia.207.d:0 "There is perhaps no greater contributor to the destruction of Earth's environment than the harmful practices of Big Business. It is clear that the best solution to the problem of Big Business is to embrace Small Business, allowing more local concerns to continue economic growth while avoiding environmental damage. In embracing local business, we balance the economic needs of Cascadia with our environmental heritage, striking a balance between Commerce and Conservation that is sure to reflect positively in the polls. As it stands, a record 76% of Cascadians have a positive opinion of Small Business, and even though the Greens have accused Small Business of often being as complicit in environmental damage as their larger counterparts, this stance has not brought the Honourable Opposition any friends. Furthermore, many of the businesses supported by these new grants have been startups in the realm of Green Technology, further benefiting the environment with this initiative. While Industrial Leaders have protested this action as weakening Cascadia in the face of foreign powers, we trust that the future of Cascadia will not be forged by the titans of destructive industry, but rather by the salt-of-the-earth local business owners who have long been stomped out by the big players."
 cascadia.207.o1:0 "The future lies with small business."

 cascadia.208.t:0 "Single Use Plastics Banned"
 cascadia.208.d:0 "In an effort to fight back against the environmental damage done to our planet, the Green Party-aligned Government of Prime Minister [CSD.GetLeader] has moved forward with a proposal to make single-use plastics illegal across Cascadia. From Plastic Straws to single-use packaging, all single-use plastics have been made illegal across Cascadia. Already 'Straw Smugglers' are being stopped at the border with contraband goods, with their haul of countless straws publicly shredded and turned into park benches. The use of single-use plastics is now punishable by a 300 $CSD fine and up to three months in prison, all while a new task force has been assembled to get straws and other single-use containers and packages off our street. Restaurants have protested the illegalization of such containers, as others move to utilize more eco-friendly alternatives. Already cardboard and glass have emerged as popular alternatives to non-biodegradable plastics, with many already beginning to adjust to the new changes in policy. However not everybody has been content with the immediate end to single-use plastics within Cascadia, with many criticizing the suddenness of the move and proposing a more gradual phase-out. Their proposals have not been heeded, as we move to rapidly remove all harmful waste from within Cascadian society."
 cascadia.208.o1:0 "The future is cardboard."

 cascadia.209.t:0 "Degrowth Initiatives Announced"
 cascadia.209.d:0 "Perpetual-growth economies have led to untold environmental destruction. As much as the Communists wish to claim to be above the concept, they are just as guilty as the Capitalist powers in the destruction of our world. They share the same blood on their hands the same as Capitalism. The cynical policy of growth for growth's sake has all but destroyed our world, and up until now Cascadia has been no different in taking part in this rat race. The time has come to at last say that enough is enough. Degrowth shall allow Cascadians to slow down and embrace the finer points of life. From now on the only economic development that shall take place shall be in essential industries operating on Green Energy. Grocery Stores, Hospitals, and the like shall be allowed to remain open, but economic pursuits deemed 'frivolous' and unduly harmful to the environment shall be forcibly shuttered. Already some are predicting Cascadia's economy to completely collapse - something which we are entirely fine with, for what is an 'Economy' - nothing more than fanciful words to describe the rape of our planet. The time has come to tune out so-called 'Economists', and focus on Cascadia as an environment, not just a nation. Of course, a complete end to Cascadia's consumer economy is entirely off the table due to a fraught majority in Parliament, so hopefully some reasonable compromises are on the table."
 cascadia.209.o1:0 "Growth for the sake of growth is the ideology of the cancer cell."

 cascadia.210.t:0 "Legitimization of Anarchism"
 cascadia.210.d:0 "Anarchists have often had a frosty relationship with the Labour Front. While we are certainly the preferred party of voters aligned with Anarchist theory, the practical connection between those engaged in Anarchism as a political ideology and the LF voter base has always been few and far between. Electoralism has not often been a winning appeal for the Anarchists, who often declare such measures as doing nothing more than legitimizing the oppressive institutions of Governance. And yet still, the most moderate wing of Anarchist organizations within Cascadia have developed a surprising connection with the Labour Front within organized politics. Cascadia itself is no stranger to Anarchism as a political philosophy, with many of our movement's founders aligned to the principles of Anarchism early on. Figures such as John Zerzan and Kevin Tucker, themselves considering the Labour Front guilty dead for daring to embrace Electoralism, have had their supporters provide key support to the Labour Front both as campaign officials and voters. The Black Bloc, of course still a hostile organization, does indeed have some common enemies within the Labour Front. Anarchism, as it stands, is our enemy, as we are at the end of the day a force of Government, but our mutual opponents, that of Fascism and Big Business, remain as such. Perhaps we can use this to our advantage."
 cascadia.210.o1:0 "Politics makes strange bedfellows."

 cascadia.211.t:0 "Urban-Rural Solidarity"
 cascadia.211.d:0 "As the divide between the Country and the City becomes more apparent, Prime Minister Franz has sought to mend the rift between the 'Two Cascadias'. The countryside, which served as the first home of the Cascadian Insurrection during the War of Independence, has never been friendly towards the Labour Front, with the CIP remaining the favoured party of the region. Franz's Party has not claimed a single seat in the 'Insurrection Belt' during her two terms in governance. Seeking to both improve her electoral prospects out East and rekindle the spirit of Urban-Rural solidarity, Prime Minister Franz has launched a new initiative aiming to improve living standards in Rural Cascadia. This new investment drive aims to promote solidarity between workers in the city and workers in the countryside. Even if the average city worker may differ greatly in ideals from a worker in the countryside, their desire for a better life, greater freedoms, and higher pay remains consistent throughout. Franz's initiatives already appear to be showing promise, even if it is a far cry from the desired Rural landslide. The deeply rural riding of Yakima-Ellensburg has been trending towards the Labour Front ever since this initiative was announced, however as it appears, the other districts in the Insurrection Belt have still remained as heartlands of CIP and Conservative support."
 cascadia.211.o1:0 "Politics makes strange bedfellows."

 cascadia.212.t:0 "Investing in the Intranet"
 cascadia.212.d:0 "Cascadia's Intranet is in an interesting place. While we enjoy high computer usage, partially due to our status as home to many large technology companies prior to the Great American Collapse, even becoming one of the first major nations to employ a Government Intranet Website, in terms of a unified Intranet system, Cascadia has fallen woefully behind. Seeking to transform Seattle into a new haven of technological growth, Prime Minister Howard Schultz has put forward extensive tax breaks and grants for businesses in the business of Intranet development. While giants such as Microsoft remain dead, countless new startup businesses are already beginning to fill the shoes of the slain titans of industry that fell during the end of the United States. Seattle is rapidly becoming the home to the former United States' most expansive big tech economy, with countless new developments emerging in the realms of biotechnology and other Intranet companies. Work to establish a cohesive Intranet System has been undertaken by the Ministry for Communications as we move to unify Cascadia across the digital sphere, removing barriers to Intranet operation and subsidizing home computer use. With due time, no Cascadian shall be a stranger, as the Intranet brings people closer together instead of further dividing them."
 cascadia.212.o1:0 "The future is on the Intranet."

 cascadia.213.t:0 "The Seattle Model of Liberalism"
 cascadia.213.d:0 "Prime Minister Howard Schultz is to many a man of contradictions. His own Liberal Party was lagging signifigantly behind in the polls before he took leadership of the Party, delivering a shock result that saw the party which once had next to no representation in the Cascadian House of Commons to enjoying a commanding majority, with opposition on every bloc seemingly crumbling as Schultz's party secured victory. Schultz now seeks to define his Premiership in the ever-shifting realm of Cascadian politics. What has emerged is what commentators have dubbed the 'Seattle Model' - a unique brand of Liberalism that champions both free enterprise and social progress in equal measure. Schultz's vision promotes aggressive investment in education and infrastructure while maintaining a business-friendly regulatory environment, arguing that economic growth and social welfare need not be opposing forces. His government has already begun implementing policies that combine tax incentives for emerging industries with expanded public services, particularly in healthcare and housing. While critics on the Left decry this approach as insufficient corporatism and those on the Right fear creeping statism, the Seattle Model appears to be resonating with Cascadians weary of ideological rigidity, offering a pragmatic middle path in an increasingly polarized political landscape."
 cascadia.213.o1:0 "Schultz's vision shall lead Cascadia forward."

 cascadia.214.t:0 "The Prime Minister Meets with Survivalist Groups"
 cascadia.214.d:0 "Cascadia's status as a nation which's widespread underground insurgency propelled a rag-tag band of militants into nationhood has naturally led to quite the underground survivalist movement forming. Unfortunately, it seems that much of Cascadia's survivalist core has been co-opted by groups not nescacarily aligned with the ideals of the Libertarian Party. Prime Minister [ROOT.GetLeader] seeks to rectify this issue in order to seperate the Cascadian ideal of rugged individualism from the White Supremacist ideals which have unfortunatley sprung up in our neigbours to the East. In a speech to assorted survivalist groups, the Prime Minister hailed those 'preparing for darkness in a time of light', stating that preparing for harsh times is a part of Cascadian life. However the Prime Minister also cautioned against those simply lashing out against modern day life, stating that surviving and thriving are two different beasts in their entirety. At the end of his speech, the Prime Minister hailed 'community willingness' and 'common values prevailing in hard times', cautioning against those who cheer on the end time instead of remaining prepared for situations in which institutions cannot function, declaring the 'Cascadia has already had it's Apocalypse, and it won'."
 cascadia.214.o1:0 "Well said."

 cascadia.215.t:0 "The Cascadian Tax Revolt"
 cascadia.215.d:0 "Taxes are an abhorrent institution. The Libertarian Government of [ROOT.GetLeader] has done their utmost to limit Taxes to the bare essentials, however many have called on the House of Commons to do more to free Cascadians from the oppressive burden of Taxation. Activists across the nation have organized rallies demanding the abolition of what they deem 'unnecessary' levies, with particular ire directed at income taxes and business regulations that they argue stifle entrepreneurship and personal freedom. The Libertarian government now faces pressure from its own base to pursue even more radical tax reform, with some backbenchers calling for the implementation of a purely voluntary taxation system, even as others beamoan the fact that the Libertarians appear to be pushing Cascadia towards bankrupcy. While [ROOT.GetLeader]'s administration has expressed sympathy with these demands, concerns remain about maintaining basic government services and avoiding a complete collapse of public infrastructure. After a tense round of negotiations, instead of additional slashing of taxes, a compromise has been reached, keeping tax rates where they are now, but codifying that any future tax increase must be passed by a popular referendum, ensuring that Cascadia remains solvent, and additional funds can be raised only if allowed so by the people."
 cascadia.215.o1:0 "Taxation is theft, or so they say."

 cascadia.216.t:0 "Police Reform Announced"
 cascadia.216.d:0 "Cascadians have long been on the wrong side of police violence. The UAPR Secret Police, heavily modelled on the LAPD, took part in brutal crackdowns in Cascadia before the Cascadian Independence War, with the crackdowns in Portland still fresh on the minds of the Cascadian people. Years later, much of Cascadia's civilian police force remains modelled on the former Communist secret police, much to the dismay of the people, who have seen the government as culpable for having failed to adequately deradicalize the Cascadian police force. Addressing the House of Commons, Prime Minister [CSD.GetLeader] has declared a need for significant police reform within Cascadia. Already funds are being repurposed from bloated police budgets towards community initiatives aimed at addressing the root causes of crime. As well, independent observers have been empowered to oversee major Metropolitan police agencies. Initiatives to demilitarize major agencies have also been undertaken, ensuring that Police forces act as guardians of local communities instead of acting as reckless occupying forces."
 cascadia.216.o1:0 "Long overdue."

 cascadia.217.t:0 "Reconciling Organized Labour"
 cascadia.217.d:0 "During the era of the Coalition for Freedom, the Progressive Party's partners in the Conservative and Libertarian parties exerted a great amount of influence on the party. Stine's status as a Coalition partner to two decidedly Center-Right parties prevented the Party from pursuing the totality of its agenda in many areas. One such area in which the Progressive Party was constricted by their Coalition Partners was the realm of Organized Labour. Stine himself was regarded as no friend to the Unions, viewing many of Cascadia's major Trade Unions as complicit in the Communist regime and/or being more loyal to the Labour Front than the Cascadian Progressives. Now that Stine is out of the picture, and the Labour Front has managed to take a commanding majority, enough to no longer be forced to rely on the Conservatives and the Libertarians, [CSD.GetLeader] has moved to restore the damaged ties to organized Labour. Major Unions have treated this newfound warmth from the Government with skepticism, even if many seem willing to hear the Prime Minister out and give them a chance to repair ties. Ultimately Organized Labour remains a fraught demographic for the Progressives, with polls showing Unions support is split between the Labour Front, which commands a majority at 54%, and the Progressives,coming in second at 40%."
 cascadia.217.o1:0 "With time, we shall mend the broken ties."

 cascadia.218.t:0 "Walden Denounces Americanism"
 cascadia.218.d:0 "The United States was a despicable failed state that destroyed the environment of our Bioregion with reckless abandon. While countless organizations stand eager to pick apart the corpse of the once-United States and claim the mantle of 'America' for themselves, Prime Minister Walden remains deadset against allowing Cascadia to once more fall into the clutches of Americanism. In a speech today, Walden declared that the concept of Americanism is dead, stating that Cascadia remains committed to the post-1987 order and will gladly spill blood to prevent Cascadia from falling into the hands of an American claimant. With fire in his voice, Walden guarded Cascadian sovereignty against anyone who wishes to see Cascadia subjugated under the Stars and Stripes, tearing into those delusional enough to think life was better under Washington's jackboot. Finishing off his speech, Walden pointed out the irony of the fact that American claimants utilize the Bald Eagle as a symbol, while simultaneously destroying the animal's natural habitat, stating that Cascadia is the only post-American nation to truly care about Conservationism and the looming threat of Climate Change. The people of Cascadia broadly agree with Walden's sentiment, and view Cascadia's wholehearted embrace of the environment as a defining factor in their post-American nationhood."
 cascadia.218.o1:0 "We shall be free from the Stars and Stripes."

 cascadia.219.t:0 "Walden Approval Ratings Skyrocket"
 cascadia.219.d:0 "Greg Walden stands as Cascadia's first and as of now only Prime Minister. Leading Cascadia through the triumphant struggle for independence against the UAPR, Walden's status as 'Father of Cascadia' has worked to his political credit, even as his Premiership has caused a stark divide between members of the wartime Popular Front and his own Cascadian Independence Party. Indeed, wartime comrades have nothing but positive things to say about Walden the Independence War commander. Walden the Prime Minister on the other hand, that's a different story. Nonetheless, Prime Minister Walden has been carefully cultivating an image as Cascadia's 'Father of Independence', something which has worked to the CIP's credit in the polls. As it stands, Walden is the most popular official in the CIP by a large movement, with most other popular figures within the CIP being fellow veterans of the Cascadian Independence War. While some have decried the attempts to foster a 'Personality Cult' around the Prime Minister, accusing the Government of engaging in increasingly authoritarian practices, it seems that the people of Cascadia remain unbothered as the Prime Minister's approval ratings reach new heights among both the CIP base and the wider Cascadian electorate."
 cascadia.219.o1:0 "Salute the Prime Minister!"

 cascadia.220.t:0 "Prime Minister Speaks to East Cascadia Voters"
 cascadia.220.d:0 "Cascadia is divided. One one end, the wretched den of drug users and hippie scum in Seattle and Portland. On the other, the honest, simple folk of East Cascadia that have been so often ignored by ineffectual Liberal Governments. The Prime Minister has declared that this paradigm shall stand no longer. MPs in the 'Insurrection Belt' - the heartland of Cascadia's independence movement, have joined the Prime Minister today on a tour of the oft forgotten regions of Cascadia. Despite serving as the grounds in which Cascadia's national identity first sprouted, these areas have been all but abandoned by the degenerates in Portland and Seattle. East Cascadia, which votes lockstep with the Cascadian Tories and the CIP, has been loyal to our government, and we seek to repay the voters of this area in kind. A new investment spree towards East Cascadia has been announced by the Prime Minister, as we move to ensure East Cascadia remains a shining haven of prosperity and morality, in stark contrast to the crime-ridden hellholes that are Urban Cascadia. While scum-sucking Urbanites have called this move paramount to Fascism, the Prime Minister doesn't care about the opinions of those dens of Drug-Users and Sodomites, realizing that the chances of the Urban ridings voting for the Cascadian Tories is slim to none. While East Cascadia remains a Conservative core constituency, this new investment spree has served to ensure the Cascadian Conservative's primacy in the polls, as support for the CIP slips in key ridings."

 cascadia.221.d:0 "Cascadia originated as an Environmentalist concept, pitching the concept of a unified Bioregion formed in the Pacific Northwest. While originally conceived as a nation dedicated to the environment, our heritage has since evolved to be much more closely linked to anti-Communism than the concept of a Bioregion. Cascadia has at last decided to abandon the lie of Environmentalism as its founding ideal, instead embracing our status as a continuation of the Empire of Astoria, a Conservative project dedicated not to Hipster ideals of environmentalism, but rather staunch regionalism and anti-Communism. While many, including some of the early supporters of the Cascadian ideal have decried this break with Environmentalism as a betrayal of Cascadian heritage, Prime Minister [CSD.GetLeader] seems unbothered by their whining. Cascadia's heritage shall remain as a natural extension of Pacific Northwest individualism, steeped deeply in anti-Communist thought and separate from the fanciful dreams of 'Bioregionalism' and business, killing Environmentalism. Eco-freaks may protest, but the Prime Minister remains adamant about this break from Cascadia's Ecological ideals. Polls have shown that Cascadians broadly disagree with the Prime Minister's claims that Cascadia as a concept bears no loyalty to the dreams of a 'Green Society', however [CSD.GetLeader]'s focus on a strong economy still enjoys widespread support from the Cascadian electorate. As of now, it seems that people are split on the issue."

 cascadia.222.t:0 "Office of President Established"
 cascadia.222.d:0 "The American System has proven to have bitterly failed over the last 40 years. The inflexibility of the United States was seen by many as a primary reason for the Great Collapse, and despite this fact being apparent to most within the Post-United States, the vast majority of new nations that broke off of Washington in '87 still continue to follow the former American System without many modifications. We seek to avoid the pitfalls of the old United States, and with our independence secured, now aim to form a cohesive national structure outside our previous status as a disorganized rebellion. Canada and the United Kingdom have proved remarkably stable, even as the rest of the Capitalist World withers away. With this in mind, the Constitutional Convention has decided to model Cascadia's system upon the Westminster System, with a mostly-ceremonial office of President serving as Head of State, and most power lying in the Prime Minister. Until elections can be held, Kate Brown, a formidable former Communist official who served as Walden's de-facto Second in Command, has been elected unanimously by the Cascadian Provisional Parliament. Walden, for the time being, has shifted from being Supreme Commander of the Cascadian Resistance to being Prime Minister, already taking up a post in the newly-created Riding of Dalles City-East until proper elections can be held. Of course, bickering within the Popular Front could lead to these elections coming sooner rather than later. As grizzled Resistance fighters leave their rifles to take up the task of forming a new nation, Cascadia sleeps, for its future will not be decided by the rhythmic pattern of gunfire, but the ever present sounds of pens scratching against official documents."

 cascadia.223.t:0 "Cascadian Presidential Election of [GetYear]"
 cascadia.223.d:0 "President Kate Brown's six-year term has expired today. The controversial Head of State of Cascadia has decided not to seek another full term in office, having been first appointed to her role after Independence and not remaining confident that voters would give her another mandate. With Brown bowing out of the race for the Presidency, several different candidates, each vying for the endorsement of a major Cascadian Political Party, have thrown their hat into the ring, despite the Presidency's status as an apolitical figurehead role. First is Ron Wyden, a prominent ally of Kate Brown and fellow Oregonian who seeks to continue Brown's positions from the last four years. Despite garnering a fair deal of controversy, Brown remains a popular figure within Cascadia due to her status as a wartime leader, making her endorsement a formidable tool for Wyden. Next is prominent Cascadian MP Jay Inslee. Inslee is a highly-popular figure within his native Progressive Party, even if rumours persist that Inslee himself is being kicked upstairs to the mostly-powerless Office of President to avoid him seeking leadership of the Party. The Cascadian Conservatives have put up prominent radio broadcaster and party official Glenn Beck, who appears to be using this run as a platform to seek greater power within his native Cascadian Tory Party. Indeed, Beck's highly-partisan campaign clashes heavily with the apolitical nature of the Presidency, making his victory unlikely, and making many ponder if Beck, like Inslee, is being thrust into the Presidency as a way to remove a potential threat from within the party. Next, the Greens have put forward Ajamu Baraka, a human rights activist and longtime Green supporter. Baraka, while previously nominated on a joint Green/Labour Front ticket, has had the Labour Front withdraw their endorsement after a string of controversial statements by Baraka, including ones praising the UAPR occupation of the region prior to independence. The Labour Front has thrown their support behind Jeff Merkley, a prominent LF Senator from Oregon. For the Libertarians, while many suspected that longtime party stalwart Wes Wagner may seek the office, a high-profile bid from prominent filmmaker David Lynch has taken the Libertarian Party by storm. Lynch's Campaign has garnered widespread attention, particularly due to Lynch's use of the surrealist themes that often featured in his work, all while promising to promote Cascadian culture and respect the apolitical nature of the office. Finally, the Cascadian Independence Party has put forward Academic and hero of the Independence War Theodore J. Kaczynski. Kaczynski, who supports the Right-Wing Environmentalism of Walden, is known for several acclaimed books, notably his bestselling work 'Industrial Society and its Future', a novel which tore into the encroachment of man on nature. Kaczynski left his home in Montana to join Cascadia as a member of an elite unit dedicated to producing explosives for the revolutionary cause. While undoubtedly hostile to the Conservatives, Kaczynski has vowed to respect the apolitical nature of the Presidency, with many predicting that Kaczynski would maintain his focus on Academic endeavors in the President's chair, even if some worry that an election result that puts a party deemed insufficiently committed to the Environmentalist struggle, Kaczynski's volatile personality may cause a political crisis.\nWith control over Cascadia's destiny in the hands of the voters, many view this mid-term election as a referendum on the success of the [GetRulingParty] Government, with a victory for their chosen candidate greatly aiding in their agenda, and a loss possibly stonewalling their government.\nWith the votes counted, it has become clear that the next individual to occupy the post of President of Cascadia shall be..."

From the 'Pac Man' and 'Donkey Kong' machines that have remained untouched throughout the years, it seems that the Arcade staples are here to stay throughout the new century. Despite attempts by the UAPR's Communist Secret Police to crack down on 'Counter-Revolutionary' Entertainment, it seems that the Cascadian love of the classics trumps any ideology. Despite countless people saying otherwise, it seems that a new gaming sensation has hit the Pacific Northwest. Polybius, a game that has no record, is taking Cascadia by storm, despite seemingly not existing at all. The psychoactive, abstract arcade game has been described as being so addictive it borders on the dangerous, with those claiming to have played it describing seizures, insomnia, night terrors, and hallucinations. The Arcade cabinets themselves, mainly confined to Portland, Oregon, are claimed to turn on at random, with those servicing the machines mentioned as having collected only unknown data, leaving the coins inside. No evidence of the game's existence has ever been proven, with authorities denying any claims that such a game exists beyond urban rumours and deliberate hoaxes. While some are adamant that evidence has either been suppressed by the Cascadian Intelligence Bureau or another mysterious 'Men in Black' agency that is using the game as psychoactive stimuli, it appears that this game is indeed an urban legend, no matter how many claims of players of this mysterious game surface. For the time being, it seems that 'Polybius' remains a popular urban legend. To some, these illusive games have disappeared without a trace, the players themselves going insane or taking their own lives, something which has only added to their mystery, while others claim that the untraceable Polybius games never existed in the first place. Indeed, the utter lack of evidence of the game's existence has swayed those who claim that Polybius is a hoax. However there still remain some die-hard fans who claim that the game is indeed real..."

 csd_flavour.2.d:0 "Everybody loves Soda. Despite the official phase-out of Capitalism during the period of UAPR, Vending Machines remained to dot the West Coast, with even the UAPR's own government buildings being stocked with junk foodstuffs. Cascadia is no different in this regard, and while the presence of vending machines is typically nothing of note in Cascadian society, one *particular* vending machine in Seattle has been a landmark of note due to its mysterious nature. Coca Cola is a thing of the past, a company which perished with the fires of the Great American Collapse, fitting its status as a symbol of the old American Empire, with the only way to get a can or bottle of the once-eponymous Soft Drink was to dip into decades-old reserves... unless you live in a particular part of Seattle, Washington. In this area of Seattle known as Capitol Hill, RC Cola is not the post-United States' most popular Soft Drink. This machine, restocked consistently with fresh Coca Cola, including flavours discontinued even before the collapse of the United States, has been one of the Pacific Northwest's most enduring mysteries. Theories range from a jilted Coca Cola executive who stole the secret recipe, to a newfangled way to make 20 year old soda taste brand new, to a time machine, to even rumours of the machine being haunted. This 1970's era Coke machine dispenses drinks for 55 cents worth of old American currency, with change vendors nearby exchanging Cascadian Dollars for old American quarters upon request just so Americans can once more enjoy the refreshing taste of this long-lost beverage. While a portal in time to a universe where the United States did not collapse seems unlikely, no concrete explanation for the machine's existence seems to exist as of now, with locals and travellers content in enjoying the taste of genuine Coca Cola on their tastebuds instead of asking questions."

 csd_flavour.3.d:0 "Bigfoot, or 'Sasquatch' as he's referred to in Cascadia, is a creature that needs no introduction. As perhaps the most famous Cryptid in the post-United States, and possibly the world. From the Jersey Devil in the Commonwealth to the so-called 'Fresno Nightwalkers', strange entities appearing to be walking pairs of pants that spurred a formal investigation by UAPR Secret Police in 2007, it seems that the infamous Sasquatch has little in the way of competition among the world of creatures that may or may not exist. If you ask any veteran of the Cascadian independence war, their answer to the question of if Sasquatch exists is always the same: a resounding yes. Aside from being a highly-popular mascot of the Cascadian Armed Forces, many have gone so far as to claim that Bigfoot assisted Cascadia's forces in their battle against the UAPR, with stories ranging from Sasquatch taking up a rifle stomping out a whole brigade of LA's finest to Bigfoot distracting the American Red Army enough for whoever's telling the story to make a miraculous escape. Now that Cascadia has secured independence, many are proposing paying it forward to the big fella, if he indeed does exist. A growing movement to amend the Endangered Species Act to include the eponymous creature has gained traction within [CSD.ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Despite the actual evidence of Sasquatch's existence being fraught, confined to word-of-mouth and suspiciously grainy footage, it seems that Cascadians remain committed to ensuring that the nation's beloved mascot shouldn't be hunted for sport on the off chance that he (or possibly she) does indeed exist. The hypothetical codification and government acknowledgment of Bigfoot's existence would certainly be a big win for believers in Sasquatch's existence, even if many don't wish to waste time with such silliness. Even those who don't believe in Sasquatch have expressed an amount of tongue-in-cheek support for such a proposal, while others wish to avoid emboldening the pseudoscientific beliefs of cryptozoology that have popped up around Sasquatch, declaring that no evidence of the creature's existence exists besides from anecdote and grainy footage, further warning that such pandering could risk embarrassing the valid cause of conservation by association.

 csd_flavour.4.d:0 "45 years ago today the town of Florence, Oregon was subject to quite a sight... and smell... A whale had washed up on the shore of the small town. At 45 feet long and a weight of more than 16,000 lbs, options to dispose of the rapidly decomposing carcass were few and far between. Naturally, officials proposed disposing of the carcass in an ingenious way. By blowing it up with 450 kg of dynamite. It was a foolproof plan, or so they thought. Officials from the Oregon Highway Department, which had oversight over the State's beaches, consulted with the US Navy on the best way to dispose of the carcass, with those consulted assuming that the force of the blast would reduce the whale carcass to a size where it could easily be scavenged by local wildlife. Unfortunately, as history would tell, things would go horribly wrong (or right, depending on your view) from there. Signs that things would go awry when the Engineer on scene, George Thornton, who himself passed away in 2013, appeared to be unaware of the proper amount of explosives needed to properly dispose of the washed up marine mammal, with a local veteran stating that the slated amount was far too much. Bystanders and media officials alike gathered to see the festivities. Instead of the manageable explosion that was planned, the whale was obliterated in a flash, even if much of the carcass remained, and chunks of the creature that once was were sent flying throughout the totality of the local area. Large chunks of blubber damaged several nearby vehicles, and drenched the town in viscera, leading to a smell that can't quite be described. The footage of this event has spread throughout Cascadia, becoming a popular 'viral' clip due to the advent of the Intranet. Surviving as a popular story and urban legend throughout Cascadia, with the event further contributing to Cascadia's unique national identity."

 csd_flavour.5.d:0 "The concept of Cascadian Nationalism, even if it would appear on the surface to be a more contemporary creation, has roots going back to the days of Thomas Jefferson. An 1813 letter from the great Thomas Jefferson to fur tycoon John Jacob Astor congratulated Astor on the establishment of Fort Astoria, the coastal fur trade post of Astor's Pacific Fur Company, describing Fort Astoria as ‘the germ of a great, free, and independent empire on that side of our continent’, stating in plain terms that the Pacific Northwest was a place of unique beauty and bounty deserving of its own right to autonomy and self-determination free of foreign machinations. This sentiment was agreed upon by fellow Founding Fathers such as John Quincy Adams, who called the region the ‘Empire of Astoria’, and James Monroe who felt that the region would one day be its own country to rival the United States, in an age long before American Manifest Destiny gobbled much of the continent from sea to shining sea. What would be known as 'Cascadian' Bioregionalism was first coined by Bates McKee, describing 'a land of falling waters'. In the early 1970s, the contemporary vision of bioregionalism began to be formed through collaboration between natural scientists, social and environmental activists, artists and writers, community leaders, and back-to-the-landers who worked directly with natural resources. While 'Cascadia' would not be one of the many nations to spawn in the Great American Collapse, the 'Cascadian' identity that formed in the 1970s would eventually enter the mainstream consciousness by the time of Washington and Oregon's merger by Communist officials, eventually 'cascading' into a full-blown war of Independence. Perhaps the most notable facet of Cascadia's identity is the so-called 'Doug Flag', designed by Portland resident Alexander Baretich. Baretich's banner would become the symbol of 'Cascadia', resulting in its illegalization by UAPR authorities by early 2005. Yet that would not deter the people of the PNW, and within time, Baretich's banner would become the official flag of the newly-founded Republic of Cascadia. While some, including Baretich have expressed skepticism about his flag being used by a sovereign nation, it seems that the flag's status as a beloved symbol of Cascadia has trumped any reservations. Baretich himself has been awarded with Cascadia's highest honour for his work in designing the nation's most iconic symbol, as the Doug Flag moves from the art project of a bored exchange student, to being hoisted above every flagpole in the region as the fluttering symbol of Cascadian nationhood.

With the pollution-happy planet killers of the Soviet World driven from the Pacific Northwest, we can turn our complete focus to undo the Soviet damage done to our planet."
CSD_crackdown_on_unificationist_thought:0 "Crackdown on Unificationist Thought"
CSD_crackdown_on_unificationist_thought_desc:0 "Reagan's dissolution of the United States was a just and rightful end to a national experiment responsible for so much environmental damage. We are Cascadians, now and forever, not Americans, we hold no loyalty to the dead nation that is the United States and intend to fight anyone who wishes to include us in any 'New America'."
CSD_venerate_walden:0 "Build the Walden Cult"
CSD_venerate_walden_desc:0 "Greg Walden's status as the 'Father of Cascadia' has greatly contributed to the CIP's continued Electoral success. As the first and so-far only Prime Minister of Cascadia, we ought to encourage the lofty image of Walden as a representative of our nation and hero of Cascadian independence."

CSD_conservative_next_term:0 "A Victory for the Cascadian Tories"
CSD_conservative_next_term_desc:0 "Despite Cascadia's status as a haven of Liberal and Progressive thought, the continued backlash against the Left following the UAPR occupation has thrust the Cascadian Tories back into the Premiership. Fueled by the rural areas of Cascadia often felt ignored in favour of big cities such as Portland and Seattle, the Cascadian Tories shall ensure the continued future of Cascadian Conservatism."
CSD_religious_campaign_contributions:0 "Campaign Finance Reform"
CSD_religious_campaign_contributions_desc:0 "As it stands, campaign contributions from religious contributions have been restricted. The time has come to undo these limits and allow the faithful to donate their hard-earned coin with impunity. The faithful shall be allowed to support the party that best represents their interests."
CSD_reach_out_to_the_forgotten_east:0 "Reach Out to the Forgotten East"
CSD_reach_out_to_the_forgotten_east_desc:0 "For too long Liberals have focused on the wellbeing of Big Cities such as Portland and Seattle, wretched dens of drug use and degeneracy, over the Heartland of Cascadian nationhood, the rural areas that first spawned our nation. The era of urbanism shall come to an end as we focus our sights on the long-forgotten areas of East Cascadia."
CSD_diminish_enviromentalism:0 "Diminish Environmentalist Roles"
CSD_diminish_enviromentalism_desc:0 "While some claim that Cascadia was born purely out of Environmentalism, the fact remain that our nation is much more tied to the ideals of anti-Communism than any fanciful concept of a 'Bioregion'. We shall seek to remind the people of this, and diminish the role of Environmentalism in Cascadia's founding."

CSD_labour_front_next_term:0 "The Renewed Labour Front"
CSD_labour_front_next_term_desc:0 "Hillary Franz has once more scored a key political victory as she defeats the last remnants of the Cascadian Political Establishment. Unconstrained by the Greens, Franz now seeks to cement her legacy, and cement Cascadia's status as a haven for Revolutionary Socialist thought."
CSD_incorporate_the_anarchist_bloc:0 "Incorporate Anarchist Blocs"
CSD_incorporate_the_anarchist_bloc_desc:0 "Cascadia's founding is intrinsically linked to Anarchism, as many within the Labour Front can attest. We shall expand the role that Anarchist theory plays in Practical Governance, even if many Anarchists remain skeptical of Electoralism as a strategy."
CSD_urban_rural_partnership:0 "Urban-Rural Partnership"
CSD_urban_rural_partnership_desc:0 "The Rural areas of Cascadia have long proven less than receptive to the Labour Front's rule. The time has come to remind them that we are not the enemy, and that a prosperous partnership between the City and the Country is indeed possible. Let us re-ignite the struggle of the Frontiers, and ensure that the fight is between rich and poor, not urban and rural."
CSD_grassroots_values:0 "Grassroot Values"
CSD_grassroots_values_desc:0 "The restoration of Democracy in Cascadia has produced some unfortunate reminders of the pitfalls of the old system. The new Establishment sprung up to stop the forces of progress dead in their tracks, and while we have thus far overcome them, we may not always be so lucky. If we are to prevent ourselves from slipping back into oligarchy, then we must ensure that grassroot values support for Progressivism remains."

CSD_green_next_term:0 "Another Victory for the Greens"
CSD_green_next_term_desc:0 "With both Capitalism and Communism standing as butchers of our natural world, Cascadia stands out as one of the few places on earth willing to fight back against the damage done to our Mother Earth. With the Greens now in power, we can focus Cascadia's entire nationhood towards this goal."
CSD_ban_single_use_plastics:0 "Ban Single-Use Plastics"
CSD_ban_single_use_plastics_desc:0 "The prevalence of single-use plastics is a disgrace. Every straw used, every plastic container thrown in the garbage, every piece of litter dotting our streets is a crime against nature itself. The time has come to dramatically cut down on our consumption of harmful plastics, and formally ban single-use packaging within Cascadia, replacing it with more biodegradable alternatives."
CSD_degrowth_initiatives:0 "Degrowth Initiatives"
CSD_degrowth_initiatives_desc:0 "Growth for the sake of growth is the ideology of the cancer cell. We must reject the harmful demands of constant economic expansion, and instead embrace the ideology of Degrowth. The ideology that shall help Cascadians survive is one of a slower way of life, and economic expansion only to survive."
CSD_against_capitalism_and_communism:0 "Against All Enemies of Earth"
CSD_against_capitalism_and_communism_desc:0 "While it is true that decades of Communist rule has done untold damage to our planet, Capitalism's hands aren't exactly clean either. We shall seek to fight against all ideologies that promote destruction to our planet, and remind people both within our Party and across Cascadia that these forces are our enemy."
