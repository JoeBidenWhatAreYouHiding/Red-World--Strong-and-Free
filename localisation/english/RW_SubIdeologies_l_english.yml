quebec_nationalism:0 "Quebec Nationalism"
quebec_nationalism_desc:0 "Social Democracy has, to some extent, always adapted to the particular nation’s environment in which it wanted to manifest its goals. It is no different in Québec, where the current course of parties such as Bloc Québécois has been shaped by the legacy of the Great Darkness and the Quiet Revolution that swept it away. Presenting an outlook on economic and social issues considerably more left to the Canadian establishment, Quebecois mainline politics are concerned with issues such as the welfare state, strong secularism, progressive values and cultural preservation of their ‘Distinct Society’. Surprisingly for many, the ‘Nationalists’ have mostly abandoned their independentist streak following the failure of the 1995 referendum."
reform_populism:0 "Reform Populism"
reform_populism_desc:0 "Originating as a revolt against the Progressive Conservative establishment of Canada, the Reform Party was shaped by a simple idea. The government in Ottawa has abandoned the Western provinces and failed to ensure the safety of the Canadian people in times of global crisis. People like Stephen Harper and Rafael Cruz offered a simple solution to the ills plaguing their once-great nation. A return to traditional values, diverting attention away from the centres of power, immediate end of uncontrolled migration and restoration of genuine fiscal conservatism shall end the recent disorder. For Canada must be strong if it is to accomplish its God-given goal, avenging the shame of the West and total defeat of Communism both domestic and international."
trumpism:0 "Trumpism"
trumpism_desc:0 "Despite Canada’s seemingly anti-American stance ingrained in its history, the people of the Great White North have spoken. And they have chosen the once American, now Canadian Dreamer. Trumpism represents the endpoint of a process began after Donald Trump’s victory in 2011. The exiled mogul has captured the hearts and souls of the Canadian populace with his entertainment flair, commitment to protectionism and support for business, as well as, curiously enough, anti-American rhetoric directed against the ‘Leftist traitors’ to the South. To some, Trump may be a mere opportunist that fled a sinking ship, but to his supporters he is the New Messiah. Without Trump, Canada would have been still rotting away as the Communists and ‘allies’ ripped them off instead of respecting the Superpower’s prosperity and strength."
neo_reactionary:0 "Neo-Reactionary"
neo_reactionary_desc:0 "In an age where people’s freedom is continuously trampled many cling to what they know, what they trust; to democracy. While it’s a simple solution for the masses, there is a select group of individuals which is in a counter-reaction to such notions. The Dark Enlightenment, or the NRx movement, consists of a wide array of figures united against the legacy of the Enlightenment. Writers like Nick Land and Curtis Yarvin, or entrepreneurs like Peter Thiel, do not see any contradiction in ‘freedom without democracy’. For the latter failed, and on the ground it sullied allowed the rise of something forgotten by time. The perfect Neo-Reactionary state, thus, combines the ideals of the Feudal lordships with primacy of the Technocratic barons. A marvel of ingenuity, at least to those worthy of its mantle."
q_theology:0 "Q Theology"
q_theology_desc:0 "During the Trump years a single spark lit a flame that caused the Storm. A mysterious radio host only identifying himself as ‘Q’ claimed to have insider information about the administration. Many within the establishment mocked him, yet there were few who followed the words of the Prophet of their God. Following Donald Trump’s death, the Queen of the movement, Romana Didulo, ascended as the new Prophetess and conduit of the Martyred Don. Under the reign of Canada1st the Northern Behemoth shall march forth and reclaim the legacy it forgot, the British-Israelist truth of Ephraim and Manasseh. And when that happens, the globalist forces scheming against Trump’s children shall tremble. The Reptile NWO Illuminati lodges will have nowhere to hide as the faithful bring the torch of humanity’s salvation to scorch their dens of evil."

idemocracy:0 "iDemocracy"
idemocracy_desc:0 "iDemocracy, also known as 'Thinking Differently', is the ideology espoused by Canada's new Prime Minister, Steve Jobs. Previously the CEO of Tech Giant Apple, Jobs has brought his unique vision for a more forward-thinking society to Canada, exemplifying his aims to get rid of government deadlock in Ottawa and bring true transparency to the Canadian people. Jobs' system has been described as Libertarian in many areas, with a strong focus on deregulation and supporting the Business class - however others have described Jobs' ideology as more Liberal and Technocratic in nature. Regardless, Jobs' ideology favours strong personal and political freedoms, governmental transparency, social Progressivism, and a renewed focus on digital integration and investment. "

sahra_wagenknecht_thought:0 "Sahra Wagenknecht Thought"
sahra_wagenknecht_thought_desc:0 "As the SED lost its way, losing the total monopoly on power and the spirit of German-ness, following the Reunification many within the party sought to remedy this crisis. While the majority sought to liberalize even further, there came to be a group which knew it would lead to nothing but ruin. Sahra Wagenknecht, a relatively young politician of Iranian-German descent, sees the solution to the crumbling Deustchland as a mix of Chinese-inspired economic opening up coupled with a return to a strict, organized, and absolutely dominant party not afraid to pursue Russophobes and anti-Stalinists within its ranks. Although relatively flexible when it concerns socially progressive topics, Wagenknecht is nonetheless wary of left-liberal agenda and adamant in returning the DDR to its Eastern soul, one led by a World-Historical individual - guided by the Geist - to bring the people back to their patriotic roots free of fascistic tendencies, as enabled by the fellow heroic notables of Sahra’s hometown of Jena: Goethe, Fichte, Hegel, Marx, Nietzsche."
eurocommunism:0 "Eurocommunism"
eurocommunism_desc:0 "While the trend of seeking greater independence from the Soviet Union is nothing new when it concerns the continent, already championed by various Neocommunists of Western Europe, the German-originated Eurocommunism puts a different emphasis on the old Warsaw Pact relationship. Claiming that Moscow has abandoned its mission of global liberation in favor of degenerating into a dictatorial state content with the position its historical legacy left it, the ‘Berliner’ Eurocommunists want to move the levers of power from the East towards the Centre. As the nations of the EU tighten their cooperation, and the wayward regimes embrace the renewed vision of Marx free of liberal rot, the Communist age shall begin anew - sweeping the Ost-autokrats into the dustbin of history."
establishment_communism:0 "Establishment Communism"
establishment_communism_desc:0 "When Marx wrote of Communism, he envisioned Socialism to be a mere transitory stage towards the final era of humanity, but what if he was wrong? Real Socialism, having vanquished the bourgeois hegemony of the United States, ushered in an age in which the states founded upon the dictatorship of the proletariat remained, seemingly ending history as we knew it. And what do such systems require, on whom do they thrive? Bureaucrats, ideologically chameleonic opportunists, men going through the motions of Communism without fully understanding it. The people representing such an establishment only do so because there is no other left, and it’s the only reality with which they are comfortable. A thankless existence, real doctrinaires could quip, and just as the walls of bleak mundanity come crashing in the apparatchik repeats a mantra he knows by heart: The Party governs, the Party advises, the Party will never betray you!"
ecological_marxism:0 "Ecological Marxism"
ecological_marxism_desc:0 "The notion of Eco-Socialism is nothing new or unusual, even in a world in which the hyper-productivist regimes have achieved dominance, yet the same cannot be said about Ecological Marxism. As the Stalinists marched through the globe, replacing the reckless capitalists with similarly criminal dictatorships, the natural world suffered immeasurable damage owing to the ‘war with nature’ - as was the case in places like Central Asia or East Germany. However, with technological advancements allowing industrial societies to move towards service economies and post-scarcity futures, the so-called Green Communists re-emerged. Noting that one can find elements of respects towards Earth in Karl Marx’s works, which were furthermore expanded by Alexander Bogdanov of Proletkult fame and the American Communalist Murray Bookchin, these visionaries hope to reject the madness of Stalinist-Lysenkoism and replace man’s conquest of nature with peaceful co-existence and rejuvenation."

globalist_socialism:0 "Hohenwerfen Model"
globalist_socialism_desc:0 "The German Democratic Republic under Premier Merkel finally moved away from the outdated modes of production, from the shackles of High Industrialization and the post-war order, towards the road to the future - yet the Eiserne Frau did not go far enough. Among the ranks of various technocrats and economists rose Klaus Schwab, a mechanical engineer by trade, becoming the second most powerful person in the nation. With his ascension to the highest office the ‘Wizard of Ravensburg’ - as some mockingly call him - is hell-bent on implementing his vision for the DDR, with no chains binding the coming Fourth Industrial Revolution. As the digitalized living cogs are set right, under the ever-watchful eye of the enlightened state, the rational man-machine shall finally transition from Socialism to Communism. Through Science to Utopia, a world void of want."

german_social_democracy:0 "Social Democracy with German Characteristics"
german_social_democracy_desc:0 "Despite the Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands emerging from a foundation built on the KPD and the SPD it failed, never accomplishing the mission with which it supposedly set out. But just as the system the SED established began to change, and many within the party hardened their hearts or lost hope in Marxism entirely, there still remained visionaries that knew the party could be moved onto the right tracks. People like Bodo Ramelow went back to the legacy of the Social Democrats and figures such as Otto Grotewohl in hopes of turning their nation into a place in which the dictatorship of the proletariat could be replaced by the democracy of the proletariat, with the promises of press freedom, electoral non-interference, justice for all, destruction of oppressive secret organizations, and good life enshrined into law for generations to come."

ordoliberalism:0 "Ordoliberalism"
ordoliberalism_desc:0 "Although Ordoliberalism is a well-known term, it’s rather imprecise and tends to be confused with general German neoliberalism, often through their shared history or the changing meanings of economic terminology. What most people think of is the SOME (social market economy), an idea outlined by professor Alfred Müller-Armack and later implemented by CDU’s Ludwig Erhard. Under the so-called Rhine model, the state must use its legal powers to ensure that a healthy and competitive environment exists so the market is as close to being free as possible. Through these regulations, exploitative capitalism is curtailed, while the addition of social welfare keeps communistic agitation in check. Just like Konrad Adenauer saw it as a way to move away from the limited confines of Christian Democracy, so too many modern adherents of Ordoliberalism see it as a remedy to Germany’s ills and a key to unlocking the second Wirtschaftswunder."

volkisch_nationalism:0 "Völkisch Nationalism"
volkisch_nationalism_desc:0 "Despite the Second World War dealing a substantial blow towards the racialist pan-German imperialism, many of the ideas which spawned it were never fully banished into the history books. The Völkisch movement preceeded the Third Reich and, seemingly, it outlasted it - if the existence of the Björn Höcke’s radical ‘Der Flügel’ faction is anything to go by. However, just as an organism has to adapt to the changing environment so too had the Völk reconsider its ideology. Putting the traditional anti-Semitism and pan-Germanism to the side, the modern Völkisch Nationalist instead champion the idea of a Germany free from elements foreign to Europe itself, taking a note from the Nouvelle Droite. A pure Deutschland shall be a state in which genuine nationalism, not barbaric imperialism, thrives - where the hostile aliens of Islam, non-White migrants, and ideological deviants are combated until necessary."

corporate_monarchism:0 "Corporate Monarchism
corporate_monarchism_desc:0 "As the Great French Revolution and subsequent societal upheavals changed the very reality around monarchies, they were forced to adapt to new conditions. While many would point towards the status quo stage of Mussolinism, where Fascism and the King marched hand-in-hand, this relationship was never genuine and ultimately broke down due to outside pressure. The real champions of involving the wider society in supporting the monarch through corporatism were to be found at the same time in Germany. Drawing on the legacy of the DVLP, the DNVP, and the arch-reactionary Alfred Hugenberg, the modern Corporate Monarchists seek to restore the glory of their sovereigns through the elimination of all hostile elements and total devotion of all subjects no matter their class - forming a true Volksgemeinschaft, a People's Community, to serve the new Reich."
reichsburger_ideologie:0 "Reichsbürger-Ideologie"
reichsburger_ideologie:0 "The so-called Reichsbürgerbewegung (Reich Citizens' Movement) characterizes its political programme with one simple statement: Germany does not exist, or rather, the current German state is an illegal private company. Although not a unified movement and rather a collection of ‘anti-constitutional’ individuals - with some notables including Heinrich XIII Prinz Reuss - the Reischbürgers claim that the Federal and Democratic Republics, or even the Weimar Republic, were established without due diligence towards the law, and thus the Second or Third Reich continue to operate. Outside of their standard far-right and neo-Nazi inspirations these Citizens came to embrace many fringe theories while fighting against the ‘puppets of foreign powers’ located in Berlin; with some of them even bordering on downright paranormal, extraterrestrial, and esoteric leans."
prussian_constitutionalism:0 "Prussian Constitutionalism"
prussian_constitutionalism_desc:0 "The term ‘Prussian Constitutionalism’ came to define the unique system of the German Empire, where the prerogatives of the Kaiser were wide and voting was organized according to quite specific rules, such as the three-class franchise which existed in the Kingdom of Prussia. While some monarchists might be quite nostalgic towards this ideal, most recognize that going back to a centuries old system is no longer feasible. Instead, this new incarnation of Prussian Constitutionalism professes a commitment to democracy, yet with a myriad of specific changes concerning weighted and plural voting, ranging from the tax wealth franchise, through educational prowess, and even ending up at royal pedigree. While the people’s ballot is technically free to choose their leaders, the monarch still has the tools to correct any-and-all mistakes a disastrous cabinet would be daring to make."

securocracy:0 "Securocracy"
securocracy_desc:0 "Back in the days of the old United States many of its citizens perceived the Eastern Bloc countries as counterintelligence states, believing every aspect of life to be overseen by shadowy organizations, seemingly unaware of their own spooks. Yet, this assessment was not entirely incorrect, as the internal ministries the likes of Stasi became subject of many legends, leading the parties to forget the anicent wisdom of ‘quis custodiet ipsos custodes?’ But just as these watchmen were left unattended the echelons of power began to slip, forgetting that power is not eternal and devotion to the revolution must be maintained. Be it for personal reasons or actual ideological zeal, the secret agents fully overthrew and replaced their former benefactors, ramping up the ‘Chekism’ to its natural conclusion. Only time will tell if these ‘siloviki’ purge the reformists and the corrupt, returning to their previous stations, or become the very manifestation of a panopticon with a state."
