quebec_nationalism:0 "Quebec Nationalism"
quebec_nationalism_desc:0 "Social Democracy has, to some extent, always adapted to the particular nation’s environment in which it wanted to manifest its goals. It is no different in Québec, where the current course of parties such as Bloc Québécois has been shaped by the legacy of the Great Darkness and the Quiet Revolution that swept it away. Presenting an outlook on economic and social issues considerably more left to the Canadian establishment, Quebecois mainline politics are concerned with issues such as the welfare state, strong secularism, progressive values and cultural preservation of their ‘Distinct Society’. Surprisingly for many, the ‘Nationalists’ have mostly abandoned their independentist streak following the failure of the 1995 referendum."
reform_populism:0 "Reform Populism"
reform_populism_desc:0 "Originating as a revolt against the Progressive Conservative establishment of Canada, the Reform Party was shaped by a simple idea. The government in Ottawa has abandoned the Western provinces and failed to ensure the safety of the Canadian people in times of global crisis. People like Stephen Harper and Rafael Cruz offered a simple solution to the ills plaguing their once-great nation. A return to traditional values, diverting attention away from the centres of power, immediate end of uncontrolled migration and restoration of genuine fiscal conservatism shall end the recent disorder. For Canada must be strong if it is to accomplish its God-given goal, avenging the shame of the West and total defeat of Communism both domestic and international."
trumpism:0 "Trumpism"
trumpism_desc:0 "Despite Canada’s seemingly anti-American stance ingrained in its history, the people of the Great White North have spoken. And they have chosen the once American, now Canadian Dreamer. Trumpism represents the endpoint of a process began after Donald Trump’s victory in 2011. The exiled mogul has captured the hearts and souls of the Canadian populace with his entertainment flair, commitment to protectionism and support for business, as well as, curiously enough, anti-American rhetoric directed against the ‘Leftist traitors’ to the South. To some, Trump may be a mere opportunist that fled a sinking ship, but to his supporters he is the New Messiah. Without Trump, Canada would have been still rotting away as the Communists and ‘allies’ ripped them off instead of respecting the Superpower’s prosperity and strength."
neo_reactionary:0 "Neo-Reactionary"
neo_reactionary_desc:0 "In an age where people’s freedom is continuously trampled many cling to what they know, what they trust; to democracy. While it’s a simple solution for the masses, there is a select group of individuals which is in a counter-reaction to such notions. The Dark Enlightenment, or the NRx movement, consists of a wide array of figures united against the legacy of the Enlightenment. Writers like Nick Land and Curtis Yarvin, or entrepreneurs like Peter Thiel, do not see any contradiction in ‘freedom without democracy’. For the latter failed, and on the ground it sullied allowed the rise of something forgotten by time. The perfect Neo-Reactionary state, thus, combines the ideals of the Feudal lordships with primacy of the Technocratic barons. A marvel of ingenuity, at least to those worthy of its mantle."
q_theology:0 "Q Theology"
q_theology_desc:0 "During the Trump years a single spark lit a flame that caused the Storm. A mysterious radio host only identifying himself as ‘Q’ claimed to have insider information about the administration. Many within the establishment mocked him, yet there were few who followed the words of the Prophet of their God. Following Donald Trump’s death, the Queen of the movement, Romana Didulo, ascended as the new Prophetess and conduit of the Martyred Don. Under the reign of Canada1st the Northern Behemoth shall march forth and reclaim the legacy it forgot, the British-Israelist truth of Ephraim and Manasseh. And when that happens, the globalist forces scheming against Trump’s children shall tremble. The Reptile NWO Illuminati lodges will have nowhere to hide as the faithful bring the torch of humanity’s salvation to scorch their dens of evil."
