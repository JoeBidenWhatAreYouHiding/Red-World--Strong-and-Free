 american_unification.100.t:0 "A Revival of the American Experiment?"
 american_unification.100.d:0 "While it has come as a shock to many, it seems that the Great Lakes Union has managed to conquer the remains of the United States. A collection of independent nations in the Former United States now lie under Muilwakkee's tutelage, the question now is what to do with our new territories. Our nation maintains no formal claim to the United States, instead claiming to be an entirely separate and independent nation from the pre-1987 United States. However, now that we have 'Unified' America under our rule, some have proposed laying claim to the old America, unifying our various satellite states into a new cohesive entity, recreating the United States in spirit. This concept has both supporters and opponents, with many content with seeing the legacy of the old United States left to rot, while others insist we take the mantle of the old United States, seeing as that it's our birthright. Others of course have labelled the United States as nothing more than a Failed Experiment, one in which us in the Great Lakes have no desire to try recreating. Amid fervent debate in Milwaukee's halls of power, a decision has been made. Shall we lay claim to the old America? Or shall we maintain our abandonment of all claims to the old USA."
 american_unification.100.o1:0 "The time has come to restore the United States."
 american_unification.100.o2:0 "We have no claims to the United States, and that is how it will stay."

 american_diplo.11.t:0 "The Americans Approach Us"
 american_diplo.11.d:0 "At long last, the United States has been united under a friendly Democratic administration, one which seems to share our goal of taking down Global Communism and restoring the light of Freedom and Democracy across the world. The Americans, while seemingly intent on joining forces with our movement, also seem to wish to take leadership of the Democratic League once more... something which Canadian leadership is more hesitant to agree to. In a meeting between American President [PCA.GetLeader] and Canadian Prime Minister [CAN.GetLeader], it has ultimately been agreed that the United States shall..."
 american_diplo.11.o1:0 "Be taking leadership of the Democratic League once more."
 american_diplo.11.o2:0 "Become the Democratic League's newest member."
 
 american_diplo.12.t:0 "The Canadians Hand Over Leadership"
 american_diplo.12.d:0 "With the rightful government of the United States restored, it has ultimately been decided that the United States will be restored to their previous position as leader of the Democratic League. In a grand ceremony in Ottawa, President [PCA.GetLeader] met with Canadian Prime Minister [CAN.GetLeader] to formalize the handover. In a grand speech, [PCA.GetLeader] declared that America was ready to step up and lead again, and were already preparing with their allies to take down the Communist menace once and for all."
 american_diplo.12.o1:0 "A great day for America."
 
 american_diplo.14.t:0 "The Canadians Retain Leadership"
 american_diplo.14.d:0 "Although the rightful government of the United States has been restored, it has ultimately been decided that the Canadians will retain their current position as leader of the Democratic League. While a disappointing conclusion for some, the Canadians seem to have their reasons for keeping hold of DL Leadership. America still has deep scars from the Reunification campaign, and as of now Canada's economic prowess still eclipses our own. While we may once more seek leadership when our economy and military has fully recovered, it seems that for now the Canadians are secure in their position as Democratic League leader."
 american_diplo.14.o1:0 "Oh well..."
 
 american_diplo.15.t:0 "America Requests our Participation in their Alliance"
 american_diplo.15.d:0 "Now that the United States has been restored, senior leadership has reached out to our government formally about the possibility of our nation joining the global struggle against Communism. Thay have requested via their ambassador, our full membership for [ROOT.GetName] within their Alliance, which would make us a key strategic and political ally of our nation. However, there are some in the government that oppose approval of this request... How should we respond?"
 american_diplo.15.o1:0 "Join!"
 american_diplo.15.o2:0 "Refuse"
 
 american_diplo.16.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] Accepts"
 american_diplo.16.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] delegation in our capital brought very exciting news for the government. [FROM.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] will officially be accepting our offer for membership in our alliance, and hence will join the alliance. This is a historic day for not just our nation and its future, but for the people."
 american_diplo.16.o1:0 "Wonderful"

 american_diplo.17.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] Refuses"
 american_diplo.17.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] delegation in our capital brought very unfortunate news for the government. [FROM.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] will not be accepting our offer for membership in our alliance, and hence we will not be joining the alliance. This could have been a historic day for not just our nation and its future, but for the people. Unfortunately, this was not the case..."
 american_diplo.17.o1:0 "Disappointing..."
 
### Focuses ###

 AMR_1987_undone:0 "1987 Undone"
 AMR_1987_undone_desc:0 "At last, the greatest tragedy of the 20th Century has been avenged. On that fateful day in 1987, when Reagan's words echoed throughout the nation, many thought that the era of the United States had come to an end. Today, they have been proven wrong. The United States are at last United once more, and now, America once more moves forward as one against the backdrop of a troubled world."
 
 AMR_align_to_the_democratic_league:0 "Join the Democratic League"
 AMR_align_to_the_democratic_league_desc:0 "The Canadians have kept up the struggle for Democracy in America's stead for more than 20 years. Now that the forces of American Democracy have once more been restored, we can link up with our old friends in Canada as we seek to restore the forces of NATO. Communists quiver as the old band gets back together again."
 AMR_take_dl_leadership:0 "Restore American Leadership"
 AMR_take_dl_leadership_desc:0 "The Canadians have done a formidable job leading the Free World since 1987, but the time has come for the United States to retake control of this alliance. While usually such a prospect would be a no-brainer, 20 years of disunity Stateside has seen Canada flourish compared to the US, and with America still reeling from the War, many have wondered if we are in a position to claim leadership of the League. Let us meet with the Canadians in Ottawa to discuss."
 AMR_new_lend_lease:0 "Modern Lend-Lease"
 AMR_new_lend_lease_desc:0 "America's military industry is booming once more, and with the wholehearted recognition of the fires of industry, it has come as an obvious conclusion that America ought to use our industrial prowess to help in the fight to restore Democracy. Across the world American arms shall once more fight for freedom, as the American giant once more begins to wake."
 AMR_on_the_beach:0 "The Eagle's Screech"
 AMR_on_the_beach_desc:0 "The American Eagle has once more spread its wings. The forces of Freedom are back, and they're angry. Our enemies must fear American soldiers landing on their shores, and to that end we must work to ensure that we have the skill and power to take advantage of our longer reach."
 AMR_lion_and_the_eagle:0 "The Lion and the Bald Eagle"
 AMR_lion_and_the_eagle_desc:0 "The United Kingdom and the United States have been close allies for almost 200 years, and while relations with the US previously ceased after our temporary collapse, now that we are back we can bring Britain back into the fight for freedom and Global Democracy"
 AMR_reach_out_to_japan:0 "Friendship with Japan"
 AMR_reach_out_to_japan_desc:0 "We have enjoyed cordial relations with the Japanese ever since the conclusion of the Second World War, and while they have withdrawn into relative isolation after the events of 1987, now that the United States is back on the top of the world, we can begin reaching out to our old allies."
 AMR_leader_of_the_free_world:0 "Leader of the Free World"
 AMR_leader_of_the_free_world_desc:0 "The decades of humiliation have finally been undone. The United States now stands stronger and more united than ever. The Free World stands ready to challenge Communism once more. The Free World has been deprived of American leadership for more than 20 years, but now that we're back, there will be hell."
 
 AMR_american_imperialism:0 "Manifest Destiny"
 AMR_american_imperialism_desc:0 "20 years in the wilderness has made America go feral. The Liberal-Communist World Order spit on our righteous struggle against Communism, and now come crawling back once we've put ourselves back together. No more. The time has come to put an end to the whiny mooches we were once so foolish to call our allies. The time has come to truly Manifest our Destiny."
 AMR_destroy_canada:0 "Day of the Rake"
 AMR_destroy_canada_desc:0 "The Canadians kept alive a disgusting perversion of the old NATO after the collapse of the United States, to little avail. The time has come to overthrow this abomination, and claim Canada for what it truly is: rightful American territory."
 AMR_invade_mexico:0 "All of Mexico"
 AMR_invade_mexico_desc:0 "The Mexicans thought that they would go unpunished for the illegal occupation of American territory following the Great Collapse. With America's bloodlust re-ignited, the hatred and fears of the populace have turned towards Mexico. With plentiful oil reserves and a history of hostility towards Americans, Mexico has naturally fallen within the New America's crosshairs."
 AMR_topple_venezuela:0 "Strike Venezuela"
 AMR_topple_venezuela_desc:0 "The regime of Chavez and Maduro have terrorized Venezuela ever since they were first brought to power in the 1992 coup. With a plentiful reserve of oil, Venezuela has been a natural target for our ambitions, and with a Communist government, the argument for War in Venezuela is both economical and strategic."
 AMR_annex_cuba:0 "Repeal the Teller Amendment"
 AMR_annex_cuba_desc:0 "The continued disloyalty of the Castro Regime has made many within Washington reconsider the value of Cuban independence. An independent Cuba is a recipe for disloyalty and hostility across the straits. The time has come to at last realize Cuba's place as rightful American territory."
 AMR_annex_greenland:0 "Annex Greenland"
 AMR_annex_greenland_desc:0 "The importance of securing the Atlantic can not be understated, especially after Western Europe went Red. Let us end this silly charade of allowing Danish and Canadians diplomats to hold Greenland when they have virtually no need of. Our American Republic could put this territory to actual use - let us send diplomats to pressure them to surrender the territory, and utilize the CIA to drum up support for Annexation within Greenland."
 AMR_the_canal_we_built:0 "The Canal we Built"
 AMR_the_canal_we_built_desc:0 "Panama would not even exist had it not been for America's desire to build the Panama Canal. Now, the Panamanians continue to utilize the Canal for their own means. This must be stopped. The time has come to retake the Panama Canal, and crush the various Socialist regimes in Central America on the way down."
 AMR_retake_the_phillipines:0 "Retake the Philippines"
 AMR_retake_the_phillipines_desc:0 "Decades ago the Philippine archipelago was content under American rule. In the years since, the Philippines has proven a vital ground to ensure American hegemony in East Asia. The time has come to retake our rightful territory, lest the ChiComs get their hands on it first."
 
 AMR_america_first:0 "America First"
 AMR_america_first_desc:0 "The United States is no second-rate power looking to salvage the scraps of a dead world order. Canada and Britain be damned, the only friend America needs is America. The time has come to create our own global power bloc, and destroy all those looking to challenge or usurp us. Tragically, the re-unification of the United States has soured many people's appetite for war, so restoring our nation's bloodlust is a top priority."
 AMR_new_monroeism:0 "New Monroe Doctrine"
 AMR_new_monroeism_desc:0 "The Soviets have long tried to get their hands on the Americas through their support of Communist regimes in Central and South America. While the era of European Colonialism is gone, the era of unwarranted Soviet influence in the Americas is alive and well. We must revive the Monroe Doctrine as a means to stop Soviet politicking in the Continent."
 AMR_align_the_middle_east:0 "Friends in the Middle East"
 AMR_align_the_middle_east_desc:0 "The United States has no shortage of potential allies in the Middle East. Iran, one of the few Democratic Governments in the region, would surely be supportive of our aims, while Saudi Arabia would benefit from American protection, all while Iraq continues to hold a history of friendship with Washington. Which one of these Middle Eastern powers should we reach out to?"
 AMR_demand_greenland:0 "Purchase Greenland"
 AMR_demand_greenland_desc:0 "The Canadians are welcome to continue their, let's be honest, hopeless struggle to restore NATO, but they can't be allowed to do so without the proper tribute. Canadian forces have been de-facto occupying Greenland with backing from the exiled Danish Royal Family for the better part of thirty years. The time has come for them to surrender Greenland to us, so we may be able to utilize the territory's awesome natural wealth."
 AMR_anti_communist_operations:0 "Anti-Communist Black Ops"
 AMR_take_down_latam_communists:0 "Take Down Latin American Communists"
 AMR_take_down_latam_communists_desc:0 "Regimes such as Venezuela, Central America and Cuba have long been scourges to both their populace and to American Foreign Policy goals. We cannot control what happens to Europe, but we have control in our own backyard. It is time to secure the New World for Capitalism. No Communism shall be allowed to flourish in the Americas."
 AMR_friendship_with_brazil:0 "Friendship with Latin America"
 AMR_friendship_with_brazil_desc:0 "The United States has long had a bad reputation among Latin American nations. The new United States seeks to change this negative perception. After all,we didn't hold a grudge against Mexico for illegally occupying our territory for two decades? Let's rub shoulders with American-friendly countries such as Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina, and perhaps bring them into our sphere."
 AMR_cia_interventioneering:0 "CIA Interventioneering"
 AMR_cia_interventioneering_desc:0 "With Langley restored to its pre-Great Collapse prowess, we can get the boys in dark shades back at work killin' Commies and spreading some Democracy all over everyone's asses. It's a real Party in the CIA across the New World as our Black Ops restart the time honoured American tradition of interfering in foreign affairs."
 AMR_world_police:0 "World Police"
 AMR_world_police_desc:0 "Before the tragic fall of the United States, many referred to America as the 'World Police', owing to our policy of attempting to keep the peace and overthrow dangerous regimes. Decades after our fatal fall, America is back, and ready to restore our status as a world power. We shall work with our allies to prevent global conflicts from spiralling out of control, and act as a bulwark against dangerous regimes across the world."
 
 AMR_the_eagles_united:0 "The Eagles United"
 AMR_the_eagles_united_desc:0 "While it may have come off as a great irony even ten years ago, it seems that the US's most natural ally in this brave new world is Russia. Having shedded Communism, it seems that the USSR is now the nation that stands in ruins as America rises again. With a brand-new Capitalist government in Moscow, many have proposed rejecting the battered-down effeminate Liberalism of the Democratic League in favour of the natural strength of the new Russia. With our rivalry behind us, perhaps it is time for the Eagles to fly together?"
 AMR_oil_empire:0 "Oil Empire"
 AMR_oil_empire_desc:0 "The twin giants of petroleum have collaborated to box out the rest of the global market. It's simple commerce really. With a veritable monopoly established on the world's fuel supply, we can begin isolating our enemies and rake in untold profits together as the titans of today's petrol market."
 AMR_target_the_democratic_league:0 "Target the Democratic League"
 AMR_target_the_democratic_league_desc:0 "The Canadians are nothing more than a band of sissified Maple Syrup drinking pansies. Their pathetic continuation of NATO is more sad than it is threatening. Taking down the Canadians and installing a compliant regime in Ottawa will be easy. We could conquer that entire nation in a long weekend."
 AMR_cia_and_fsb:0 "The CIA and FSB United"
 AMR_cia_and_fsb_desc:0 "Old foes have been brought together in the service of a common cause. While once agents of the CIA and FSB interacted on a first-name-basis as bitter enemies, now Russian and American intelligence forces work hand-in-hand subverting the forces of Fascism and Imperialism across the globe. We're lucky to have the only people to ever best American intelligence on our side now."
 AMR_recognize_russian_claims:0 "Recognize Russian Claims"
 AMR_recognize_russian_claims_desc:0 "We too know the pain of losing our core territory, and then having the international community scoff as we seek to reclaim what is rightfully ours. Just like the nations of the post-United States, the nations split from the shattered USSR are nothing more than farces. The time has come to recognize Russia's rightful territory, and work to aid Russia in restoring territorial integrity, just as we did in the United States."
 AMR_alaskan_connections:0 "Alaskan Connections"
 AMR_alaskan_connections_desc:0 "We are lucky to be so close to our allies via the Bering straight. While the possibility of a bridge between Alaska and Chukota is sadly beyond our technological aims at the moment, we can use the physical proximity of Alaska to Russia to our advantage. Joint bases shall be set up across Alaska as we work to connect our two nations like never before. With the barriers of the Cold War removed, we can at last reach our arms across the Arctic in solidarity."
 AMR_private_military_contractors:0 "Private Military Contractors"
 AMR_private_military_contractors_desc:0 "Russia and the new United States both have an abundance of Private Military Contractors more than willing to kick ass for the highest dollar. By pooling together our resources in this area, we can begin chipping back at hostile regimes without sending any of our soldiers to die... officially. While some have been so rude as to call our brave men in privately paid for uniform 'Mercenaries', we know that these Private Contractors are the best that money can buy, and will surely help our Foreign Policy aims."
 
 AMR_neutrality:0 "Neutrality"
 AMR_neutrality_desc:0 "The Reagan years have proven to us that trying to interfere in the affairs of other nations is a losing game. We have fought so hard to reclaim the United States, and have lost so many men. We can't go through the loss and heartbreak of more dead American soldiers again. The time has come to focus inwards, and leave the rest of the world to their squabbles. So long as no other nations desire conflict with us, we desire no conflict in return."
 AMR_naval_prominence:0 "Defense of America"
 AMR_naval_prominence_desc:0 "America has been through hell, and the time has not yet come for us to become embroiled in foreign difficulties. We must look to our home, ensure it is in order, and defend our walls should enemies come knocking on our doors. A strong navy is important to defense and the navy's capabilities shall be invested in to keep away imperial power as that is their only means of reaching us."
 AMR_defend_our_borders:0 "Defend our Borders"
 AMR_defend_our_borders_desc:0 "The first step in our defence must be to ensure our walls are well-guarded. Borders with Mexico and Canada have been far too porous. The time has come to guard our borders instead of open them. A complete fortification network on our borders shall help make any attempts to conquer American territory impossible."
 AMR_trade_empire:0 "The Business of Neutrality"
 AMR_trade_empire_desc:0 "Neutrality has its benefit in that our enemies are few, and thus our trading partners plentiful. If America is to build itself into a true world power, we must do so on the back of the mighty American dollar."
 AMR_international_arms_dealer:0 "International Arms Dealer"
 AMR_international_arms_dealer_desc:0 "With our industry fired up following the restoration of the United States, we have plenty of guns and nobody to use them on. With our neutrality secured, the United States can make some money selling weapons to conflict zones the world over. Our scruples about the wars these weapons are used in shall be washed away by the only thing that truly matters in this world: the almighty Dollar."
 AMR_british_model:0 "The British Approach"
 AMR_british_model_desc:0 "Unlike those who continued a foolish resistance against the forces of Communism, Britain chose to retreat into self-imposed isolation following the fall of Capitalism. We have much to learn from Britain in their pursuit of Neutrality. Let's take inspiration from the British Isles Protection Union in our geopolitical pursuits."
 AMR_city_on_a_hill:0 "The City on a Hill"
 AMR_city_on_a_hill_desc:0 "With the hardship of the last 20 years behind us, America has once more become a shining beacon of progress. We shall further our prosperity by further diverting military and diplomatic funding to industry, subsidizing popular American needs in the process, especially in the motor and consumer electronics industry."
 AMR_city_on_a_hill:0 "An End to the American Century of Humiliation"
 AMR_city_on_a_hill_desc:0 "The great ideological struggle for world peace has established the explicit power of the American industry and economy once more. The humiliations of the last 20 years have been clawed back as America once more rises as a beacon of peace and stability in the New World. Let the Communists and Democratic League struggle in their own pointless conflicts - America is content to sit by on the sidelines, reaping in the benefits as we play both sides off each other."

 AMR_strategic_bases:0 "Worldwide Strategic Bases"
 AMR_strategic_bases_desc:0 "To challenge the Soviet World order which has emerged in America's absence, we must get to work establishing strategic points of attack across the world. Former American Allies shall once more receive the call to join our cause, and aid one day in the liberation of Red Europe."
 AMR_atlantic_outposts:0 "Atlantic Outposts"
 AMR_atlantic_outposts_desc:0 "We can not take Europe without the Atlantic and as such will build our capabilities there. Iceland would be an ideal starting point but it is yet to be seen whether they will cooperate or not. Considering our historical protection of their island, they are likely to accept - however many wonder if they are willing to forfeit their neutrality. It is worth a try."
 AMR_new_marine_corps:0 "New Marine Corps"
 AMR_new_marine_corps_desc:0 "The Marine Corps must be expanded and invested in to emphasize our goals of invading regions around the globe. Their training, and fortitude will be far greater, and they will be emphasized as spreading American interests for all of us."
 AMR_destroy_the_warsaw_pact:0 "Destroy the Warsaw Pact"
 AMR_destroy_the_warsaw_pact_desc:0 "The day we have been waiting for for half a century has finally arrived. We have tried and failed to bring a peaceful resolution to the problem of global Communism, and have been forced to take violent measures. The despicable stain of Global Communism shall finally be wiped off the earth as we move to finally end the rule of the USSR and their red offspring. "
 
 AMR_contain_chinese_agression:0 "Contain Chinese Aggression"
 AMR_contain_chinese_agression_desc:0 "The pre-1987 United States employed to great success a strategy to contain Chinese influence in Asia by making strategic allies along Chinese borders. With the Chinese Tiger awakening once more, there seems to be no shortage of nations in Asia who would welcome American protection once more; even if their governments are less than friendly to our ideals. Let us bury the hatchet with the Vietnamese."
 AMR_strike_beijing:0 "Strike Beijing"
 AMR_strike_beijing_desc:0 "The time has come to mobilize our allies and put an end to the CCP's despicable regime once and for all! Soon, American Marines will be patrolling the very streets of Beijing itself - the Stars and Stripes rising over the forbidden city."
 AMR_chinese_ambivalence:0 "Chinese Ambivalence"
 AMR_chinese_ambivalence_desc:0 "Our policy towards China, no matter how friendly or antagonistic it may be, does not need to extend beyond the parameters we have already set. The time has come to pledge our neutrality in Chinese Affairs, and lock ourselves on to an eternal staring contest with Beijing."
