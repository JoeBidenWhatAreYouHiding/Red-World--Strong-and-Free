american_unification.100.t:0 "A Revival of the American Experiment?"
american_unification.100.d:0 "While it has come as a shock to many, it seems that the Great Lakes Union has managed to conquer the remains of the United States. A collection of independent nations in the Former United States now lie under Muilwakkee's tutelage, the question now is what to do with our new territories. Our nation maintains no formal claim to the United States, instead claiming to be an entirely separate and independent nation from the pre-1987 United States. However, now that we have 'Unified' America under our rule, some have proposed laying claim to the old America, unifying our various satellite states into a new cohesive entity, recreating the United States in spirit. This concept has both supporters and opponents, with many content with seeing the legacy of the old United States left to rot, while others insist we take the mantle of the old United States, seeing as that it's our birthright. Others of course have labelled the United States as nothing more than a Failed Experiment, one in which us in the Great Lakes have no desire to try recreating. Amid fervent debate in Milwaukee's halls of power, a decision has been made. Shall we lay claim to the old America? Or shall we maintain our abandonment of all claims to the old USA."
american_unification.100.o1:0 "The time has come to restore the United States."
american_unification.100.o2:0 "We have no claims to the United States, and that is how it will stay."
