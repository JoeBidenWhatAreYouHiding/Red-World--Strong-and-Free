While usually such a prospect would be a no-brainer, 20 years of disunity Stateside has seen Canada flourish compared to the US, and with America still reeling from the War, many have wondered if we are in a position to claim leadership of the League.

 american_unification.100.t:0 "A Revival of the American Experiment?"
 american_unification.100.d:0 "While it has come as a shock to many, it seems that the Great Lakes Union has managed to conquer the remains of the United States. A collection of independent nations in the Former United States now lie under Muilwakkee's tutelage, the question now is what to do with our new territories. Our nation maintains no formal claim to the United States, instead claiming to be an entirely separate and independent nation from the pre-1987 United States. However, now that we have 'Unified' America under our rule, some have proposed laying claim to the old America, unifying our various satellite states into a new cohesive entity, recreating the United States in spirit. This concept has both supporters and opponents, with many content with seeing the legacy of the old United States left to rot, while others insist we take the mantle of the old United States, seeing as that it's our birthright. Others of course have labelled the United States as nothing more than a Failed Experiment, one in which us in the Great Lakes have no desire to try recreating. Amid fervent debate in Milwaukee's halls of power, a decision has been made. Shall we lay claim to the old America? Or shall we maintain our abandonment of all claims to the old USA."
 american_unification.100.o1:0 "The time has come to restore the United States."
 american_unification.100.o2:0 "We have no claims to the United States, and that is how it will stay."

 american_diplo.1.t:0 "The New United States Asks to Join the Democratic League"
 american_diplo.1.d:0 "Incredible. There are no other words to describe what has happened South of the Border. The United States, despite all odds to the contrary, has pulled itself out of the dustbin of history. The cause of Freedom and Democracy championed by the US (to some degree) before Reagan mucked it all up has been restored. The Statue of Liberty's torch once more gleaming across the once-more-United States. Ottawa has breathed a tremendous sigh of relief as this newly-reunited America has proven to be a friendly one, very much in tune with the US of Old. [var:901.owner.GetLeader] is apparently eager to get back into the business of beating up Commies, hopefully with more success than the last time around. A restoration of the United States is in every way a game-changer for the DL, and would almost single-handedly triple our capacity to oppose the Soviet World Order. However some remain weary of this new United States, and worry about Canada's place in the world should the Americans be formally inducted into our alliance. The Decision is up to Prime Minister [CAN.GetLeader] and the House of Commons - even if most predict that the new US will easily be accepted into the Democratic League."
 american_diplo.1.o1:0 "Is this even a question? Of course the Americans can join."
 american_diplo.1.o2:0 "Well, uh, something, something... Article 8?"

 american_diplo.2.t:0 "The United States Inducted into the Democratic League"
 american_diplo.2.d:0 "The Canadians were crawling over themselves to accept our proposal. The new United States has become the newest member of the Democratic League, restoring the old NATOs' most powerful members and inspiring dread across the Warsaw Pact. As it appears, the clock has been pushed back from 1987, as the old band gets back together again. In an instant, the global balance of power has shifted irreparably, and while the Communists are still self-assured about their own security, doubt has been inspired across the Warsaw Pact. The forces of Freedom are not quite dead yet. And while our new United States may still need some patches to cover the cracks, we are still a formidable force in our own right, ready and willing to go toe-to-toe with Red Europe. This time, we shall not falter, we shall not fail. Vietnam and Korea have taught us the lessons we need to survive. Reaganism has been banished from the face of the US. And now, we seek to turn back the clock in Europe, undo the European Spring, and at last make the Free World whole again."
 american_diplo.2.o1:0 "Three Cheers! To Freedom!"
 
 american_diplo.3.t:0 "The Canadians Decline"
 american_diplo.3.d:0 "In what has come as a shock to everybody in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], the Canadians, who would in any reasonable scenario be salivating at the chance to have the US by their side once more, has declined our offer to join the Democratic League. While they have cited ongoing territorial disputes as their primary reason for their rejection of our League application, many have wondered if the Canadians have simply denied out of a fear of us usurping their leadership of the League. No matter. The DL is a poor man's version of NATO anyway, their attempts at opposing Communism being more pathetic than brave. We can easily do without the Canadians and their garbage pail of losers. The time has come for the Eagle to spread its wings, with, or without the Canadians."
 american_diplo.3.o1:0 "Are they stupid?"

 american_diplo.4.t:0 "The New United States Asks to Join the Moscow Accord"
 american_diplo.4.d:0 "Incredible. There are no other words to describe what has happened South of the Border. The United States, despite all odds to the contrary, has pulled itself out of the dustbin of history. In what has been described as the most stunning turn of fate of the last 100 years, the Soviet Union has Collapsed while the United States has thrived, in what has been both a painfully ironic twiste of fate and a golden oppurtunity for the New Russia. Indeed, while it would seem insane to anyone who's been in a coma for 20 years, the United States and Russia are the most ideologically aligned of any two major nations. With that in mind, the new US Government has reached out with a proposition of alliance, which would see the new United States inducted into the Moscow Accords if we accept. Such a proposal would naturally be a no-brainer. Russia and the US on the same team would be nigh unstoppable. However many wonder if the bad blood between our two nations may still exist, or worse, if the US may end up outshining us as leader of the alliance. [RUS.GetLeader] has returned to his chambers to contemplate the future of US-Russia relations."
 american_diplo.4.o1:0 "Is this even a question? Of course the Americans can join."
 american_diplo.4.o2:0 "We still don't trust you America!"

 american_diplo.5.t:0 "The United States Inducted into the Moscow Accord"
 american_diplo.5.d:0 "The Russians were crawling over themselves to accept our proposal. The new United States has become the newest member of the Moscow Accord, in what has come as the most shocking turn of fate this century. As it appears, the tables have turned. Long divided must unite, and long united must divide. America stands whole while Soviet hegemony lies shattered. In an instant, the global balance of power has shifted irreparably, and while the Communists are still self-assured about their own security, doubt has been inspired across the Warsaw Pact. Already the Democratic League and Warsaw Pact nervously sweat as a seemingly impossible American-Russian alliance forms. Now, America is ready for both the forces of Communism and Liberalism. This time, we shall not falter, we shall not fail. Vietnam and Korea have taught us the lessons we need to survive. Reaganism has been banished from the face of the US. And now, we seek to turn back the clock in Europe, undo the European Spring, and restore strength to this world."
 american_diplo.5.o1:0 "Three Cheers! To Freedom!"
 
 american_diplo.6.t:0 "The Russians Decline"
 american_diplo.6.d:0 "In what has come as a shock to everybody in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], the Russians, who would in any reasonable scenario be salivating at the chance to have the US by their side once more, has declined our offer to join the Moscow Accord. While they have cited a distrust of the United States after so many years of hostility primary reason for their rejection of our Accord application, many have wondered if the Russians have simply denied out of a fear of us usurping their leadership of the Accord. No matter. We still don't trust the Russians, and if they want to reject our efforts to repair relations, then it's their loss. While they may have been cleaned from the stain of Communism, they have not yet shedded their wicked Communist ideals."
 american_diplo.6.o1:0 "Up yours, Ruskies."

 american_diplo.7.t:0 "The New United States Asks to Join the Protection Union"
 american_diplo.7.d:0 "Incredible. There are no other words to describe what has happened South of the Border. The United States, despite all odds to the contrary, has pulled itself out of the dustbin of history. Now the United States, also commited to the cause of Neutrality, has proposed an alliance between our two nations. Britain and the United States, while once enemies, have always enjoyed a strong relationship, until the US's untimely collapse in the late 80's. Now, the Americans are looking to solidify our alliance once more, forming an alliance dedicated to Neutrality on both the British Isles and the North American continent. Such an alliance would be quite the formidable force against Communists and Warmongers, however some worry about potentially being dragged into America's conflicts despite their vow of Neutrality. It's all up to [ENG.GetLeader] and the House of Commons to decide on the fate of Anglo-American relations."
 american_diplo.7.o1:0 "Is this even a question? Of course the Americans can join."
 american_diplo.7.o2:0 "The British Isles are our concern, not the United States."

 american_diplo.8.t:0 "The Global Protection Union Formed"
 american_diplo.8.d:0 "The British have delighted at our proposal to form a global Neutral bloc. While some have scoffed at the new US's commitment to 'Neutrality', favouring a continued approach of fortifying the British Isles, it seems that the British are more than happy to throw in with their old chums across the pond. The forces of Britain and America are once more united as allies, together under the shared banner of neutrality and non-interventionism. Any forces that dare mess with our territorial integrity have another thing coming as the two giants of the Anglo World commit themselves to a reclusive stance towards global affairs. The Lion (and the Eagle) sleeps tonight, as we both retreat from Global Affairs, caring only for the wellbeing of our citizenry and the integrity of our territory - nothing more, nothing less. While the League may look on with dissapointed eyes as the old NATO's two greatest powers shun their cause, ultimately, the battle against Communism is already lost. So long as they don't interfere with us, we have no desire to interfere against them."
 american_diplo.8.o1:0 "Never more shall we interfere in global affairs."
 
 american_diplo.9.t:0 "The British Decline"
 american_diplo.9.d:0 "The British Government has told us politley to 'Bugger Off', as London soundly rejects the prospect of a global Neutral bloc between America and Britain. While we were once near-inseprable allies, it seems as if the British have defaulted into the mindset of George III as they seek to protect the British Isles - and only the British Isles. Even though the new US posesses the might to defend Britain from any invader, the British have no intention of sending their men to die to stabilize the highly-fragile new America, and given our own strict neutrality, we can't exactly blame them. Though our relations have been damaged by their refusal, we still maintain a close link with London, our frienship, while uncodified by any treaty or alliance, shall still persevere in this new era. So, we raise a toast, to [ENG.GetNameDef] and [var:901.owner.GetNameDef], two powers united but seperate in the cause of eternal neutrality."
 american_diplo.9.o1:0 "The Lion (and Eagle) sleeps tonight."
  
 american_diplo.10.t:0 "Our Allies in the Middle East"
 american_diplo.10.d:0 "The Government of [ROOT.GetLeader] has begun to once more inquire about possible American friendships abroad. The Middle East is a subject of particular interest to the new State Department, with many pathways for friendships and alliances opening up now that we are once more united. The first option is Iran. Iran, one of the few stable Democracies in the Middle East, has something of a checkered past with the United States. From the CIA to the Shahs, Tehran and Washington have not always seen eye-to-eye. But now is the time to patch over old wounds, and while the prospect of an alliance with the Iranians may seem like a tough sell, perhaps forging an alliance is America's way of apologizing? Another option is Saudi Arabia, a longstanding US 'ally' in the region. The Saudis are invaluable for their strategic location and oil reserve, even if some have raised concerns about Saudi Human Rights Abuses. Finally there is Iraq, a nation which the old US was close to before the Great Collapse. Saddam Hussein is a natural friend to American interests and enemy of Communism, which makes him the perfect ally in the region. Which Middle Easter nation should we reach out to?"
 american_diplo.10.o1:0 "Iran."
 american_diplo.10.o2:0 "Saudi Arabia."
 american_diplo.10.o3:0 "Iraq."
 
 american_diplo.2000.o1:0 "Try reaching out to Iraq."
 american_diplo.2000.o2:0 "Try reaching out to Iran."
 american_diplo.2000.o3:0 "Try reaching out to Saudi Arabia."
 
 american_diplo.11.t:0 "The Americans Approach Us"
 american_diplo.11.d:0 "At long last, the United States has been united under a friendly Democratic administration, one which seems to share our goal of taking down Global Communism and restoring the light of Freedom and Democracy across the world. The Americans, while already intent on joining forces with our movement, also seem to wish to take leadership of the Democratic League once more... something which the Canadian government is more hesitant to agree to. In a meeting between American President [var:901.owner.GetLeader] and Canadian Prime Minister [CAN.GetLeader], it has ultimately been agreed that the United States shall..."
 american_diplo.11.o1:0 "Be taking leadership of the Democratic League once more."
 american_diplo.11.o2:0 "Stay as a valued member of the alliance."
 
 american_diplo.12.t:0 "The Canadians Hand Over Leadership"
 american_diplo.12.d:0 "With the rightful government of the United States restored, it has ultimately been decided that the United States will be restored to their previous position as leader of the Democratic League. In a grand ceremony in Ottawa, President [var:901.owner.GetLeader] met with Canadian Prime Minister [CAN.GetLeader] to formalize the handover. In a grand speech, [var:901.owner.GetLeader] declared that America was ready to step up and lead again, and were already preparing with their allies to take down the Communist menace once and for all."
 american_diplo.12.o1:0 "A great day for America."
 
 american_diplo.14.t:0 "The Canadians Retain Leadership"
 american_diplo.14.d:0 "Although the rightful government of the United States has been restored, it has ultimately been decided that the Canadians will retain their current position as leader of the Democratic League. While a disappointing conclusion for some, the Canadians seem to have their reasons for keeping hold of DL Leadership. America still has deep scars from the Reunification campaign, and as of now Canada's economic prowess still eclipses our own. While we may once more seek leadership when our economy and military has fully recovered, it seems that for now the Canadians are secure in their position as Democratic League leader."
 american_diplo.14.o1:0 "Oh well..."
 
 american_diplo.15.t:0 "America Requests our Participation in their Alliance"
 american_diplo.15.d:0 "Now that the United States has been restored, senior leadership has reached out to our government formally about the possibility of our nation joining the global struggle against Communism. Thay have requested via their ambassador, our full membership for [ROOT.GetName] within their Alliance, which would make us a key strategic and political ally of our nation. However, there are some in the government that oppose approval of this request... How should we respond?"
 american_diplo.15.o1:0 "Join!"
 american_diplo.15.o2:0 "Refuse"
 
 american_diplo.16.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] Accepts"
 american_diplo.16.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] delegation in our capital brought very exciting news for the government. [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] will officially be accepting our offer for membership in our alliance, and hence will join the alliance. This is a historic day for not just our nation and its future, but for the people."
 american_diplo.16.o1:0 "Wonderful"

 american_diplo.17.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] Refuses"
 american_diplo.17.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] delegation in our capital brought very unfortunate news for the government. [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] will not be accepting our offer for membership in our alliance, and hence we will not be joining the alliance. This could have been a historic day for not just our nation and its future, but for the people. Unfortunately, this was not the case..."
 american_diplo.17.o1:0 "Disappointing..."
 
 american_diplo.18.t:0 "The Yanks Reach Out Once More"
 american_diplo.18.d:0 "With the United States restored, the new American Government has seen fit to pester the British Foreign Office about the possibility of joining the Democratic League. While we have been firm in the past about our rejection, our decision to embrace Isolationism was primarily driven by the Collapse of the United States. With America both restored to its former glory and once more joining the fray, many have wondered if reconsidering our stance of non-interventionism is the way. The Warsaw Pact's claws are poised to dig into the British Isles, and having both the Canadians and the Americans by our side once more may be enough to deter Moscow's Goons, or fight them back if such a crisis arises. The prospect of returning to the Old Older seems promising, even if some wonder if the new US is doomed to repeat all the mistakes of the old US. "
 american_diplo.18.o1:0 "We shall stand with the Canadians once more."
 american_diplo.18.o2:0 "We said no, and we mean it!"
  
 american_diplo.19.t:0 "Britain Joins the Democratic League"
 american_diplo.19.d:0 "The United Kingdom has once more decided to side with their old colonies, and join the global struggle against Soviet Communism. After a lengthy series of negotiations, the British have dissolved the Protection Union and signaled the unification of our two forces, now with the intent to take down the Warsaw Pact and Liberate Europe. London now requests Ireland's participation in this new global force, even if the governments in Dublin and Belfast aren't entirely sold on the idea. What shall our response be? Shall we join our allies in Britain on their quest, or shall we continue our policy of neutrality, and leave the rest of the world to their own devices."
 american_diplo.19.o1:0 "They're better than the Soviets..."
 american_diplo.19.o2:0 "We shall continue Irish neutrality."
  
 american_diplo.20.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] Follows Suit"
 american_diplo.20.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has decided to follow the step of their allies in Britain, and has joined the Democratic League. The British Isles Protection Union now will join the Democratic League wholesale, instead of Britain simply leaving Ireland to their own devices."
 american_diplo.20.o1:0 "Wonderful!"
  
 american_diplo.21.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] Refuses"
 american_diplo.21.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has refused to follow the steps of their allies in Britain, and will not be joining the Democratic League. While Britain itself is by our side once more, it appears that the [FROM.GetAdjective] aren't completely sold on the idea of taking down Communism, and would prefer to sit on the sidelines."
 american_diplo.21.o1:0 "Oh well..."
   
 american_diplo.22.t:0 "The British Accept"
 american_diplo.22.d:0 "More good news has come from the United Kingdom. London has delighted in the prospect of returning to the pre-1987 status quo. British Neutrality, spurred by America's collapse, now no longer has a use. The US is back, and it's ready to start knocking heads once more. Britain, America, and Canada once more fight together as one force. The Boys are Back in Town, the triple threat of the Anglo world now ready to kick some Communist ass. Already the Warsaw Pact appears to be preparing for the worst as the old North Atlantic Treaty Organization seemingly rises from the grave. We don't know exactly what the future will hold now that the old alliance has been restored, but if there is one thing we do know, it's that there will be hell to pay for the Communists once the time comes."
 american_diplo.22.o1:0 "The Reds must be shitting themselves."

 american_diplo.23.t:0 "The British Decline"
 american_diplo.23.d:0 "Britain was only driven to neutrality due to the United States' collapse - yet despite the restoration of a single American nation, it seems the British are still unwilling to budge from the long-held position of Isolationism. A pity. The British seem to think that the Democratic League's opposition to Communism remains hopeless despite America's restoration, and is content simply standing back and watching the affairs of the world with disinterested eyes. While the British have maintained their longstanding friendship with Washington and Ottawa, their friendship will not be codified by any treaty or alliance. Britain, after so many years of interventionism, seems content to at last shut out the affairs of the wider world forever, never more wishing to involve themselves in the whims of the greater world again."
 american_diplo.23.o1:0 "A terrible shame."
 
 american_diplo.24.t:0 "America Demands Possession of Greenland"
 american_diplo.24.d:0 "The United States has sent a letter and diplomat offering to 'purchase' Greenland from us at an absurdly measly price while claiming war is on the table for the territory due to its 'importance to national security'. Their insistence is clearly an attempt at strong-arming us, but given their resources and location of the area, we likely have no choice but to accept. Native Greenlanders are split on the issue. While we legally do not control Greenland, that honour belongs to the Danish Royal Family, Canada's responsibility for Greenland's defense gives Ottawa de-facto veto power over Greenlandic affairs. Extensive CIA infiltration has already made the government in Nuuk reluctantly support annexation, however the ultimate decision still lies with the Prime Minister. Should we accept the American's demands? Or should we defend Greenland at all costs?"
 american_diplo.24.o1:0 "We have no choice but to accept."
 american_diplo.24.o2:0 "Not going to happen."
  
 american_diplo.25.t:0 "The Canadians Accept"
 american_diplo.25.d:0 "The Canadian government has accepted our demands, and has released Greenland from their de-facto control. Now it's up to the Government in Nuuk to formally make a decision on Greenland's annexation. Thanks to extensive infiltration from the Central Intelligence Agency, the vast majority of Greenland's population supports American annexation. However there are still some who fiercely oppose 'American Imperialism' and are dedicated to both resisting American attempts at Annexation, and the Canadians who have 'thrown them under the bus'."
 american_diplo.25.o1:0 "Let's hope they make the right choice."
 
 american_diplo.26.t:0 "The Canadians Abandon Us"
 american_diplo.26.d:0 "The Canadians have begrudgingly accepted American demands to withdraw from Greenland. We have been left for dead as America looks to our territory with hungry eyes. Ottawa's withdrawal has left our small defense force completely exposed to American military might, while CIA agents continue to spread pro-annexation propaganda throughout our cities. The American ambassador has made it clear that Washington expects a swift decision in their favor, with thinly-veiled threats of military intervention should we choose to resist. Our parliament is deeply divided between those who see annexation as inevitable and those who would rather fight a hopeless war than surrender our sovereignty."
 american_diplo.26.o1:0 "We must accept Annexation."
 american_diplo.26.o2:0 "We shall fight for our freedom."
   
 american_diplo.27.t:0 "Greenland Passes Annexation Act"
 american_diplo.27.d:0 "The Government of Greenland has formally passed an act to incorporate their nation with the New United States. The vote in Nuuk's parliament was overwhelming, with only a small minority of delegates opposing the measure. Our intelligence operations and promises of economic investment have paid off handsomely. While scattered protests have erupted in some coastal villages, the transition is expected to proceed smoothly as Greenland becomes America's newest territory."
 american_diplo.27.o1:0 "Wonderful."
    
 american_diplo.28.t:0 "Greenland Rebels"
 american_diplo.28.d:0 "Greenland has defied the will of both the United States and Canada, declaring that they intend to remain independent even if they have to fight for it. The parliament in Nuuk has voted down the annexation act and expelled all CIA operatives from the territory, while nationalist militias have begun mobilizing across the island. Our allies in Greenland's government have been branded as traitors and forced to flee or go into hiding. This embarrassing display of defiance cannot go unanswered, lest other territories get similar ideas about resisting American interests."
 american_diplo.28.o1:0 "Crush them!"
     
 american_diplo.29.t:0 "Canada Refuses"
 american_diplo.29.d:0 "The Canadians have refused to cease their military protection of the territory of Greenland. Many have suggested that war may be on the table to take the territory by force. Ottawa has publicly condemned our 'blatant attempt at imperialism' and has reinforced their garrison on the island. The Canadian Prime Minister claims they have a moral obligation to protect Greenland from American aggression, though intelligence suggests they're more concerned about maintaining their own influence in the Arctic. Our military advisors are confident that any conflict would be swift, but going to war with a former ally over Greenland would certainly damage our international reputation and potentially drag other nations into the conflict."
 american_diplo.29.o1:0 "War is the only option."

This could have been a historic day for not just our nation and its future, but for the people. Unfortunately, this was not the case..."

 AMR_1987_undone_desc:0 "At last, the greatest tragedy of the 20th Century has been avenged. On that fateful day in 1987, when Reagan's words echoed throughout the nation, many thought that the era of the United States had come to an end. Today, they have been proven wrong. The United States are at last United once more, and now, America once more moves forward as one against the backdrop of a troubled world."
 
 AMR_align_to_the_democratic_league:0 "Join the Democratic League"
 AMR_align_to_the_democratic_league_desc:0 "The Canadians have kept up the struggle for Democracy in America's stead for more than 20 years. Now that the forces of American Democracy have once more been restored, we can link up with our old friends in Canada as we seek to restore the forces of NATO. Communists quiver as the old band gets back together again."
 AMR_rebuild_intel_apparatus:0 "Rebuild Intelligence Apparatus"
 AMR_rebuild_intel_apparatus_desc:0 "Now that the CIA is back in business, we can at last begin work chiseling away at the Communist dominance over the world of intelligence. The KGB and Stasi have long outplayed Capitalist forces such as CSIS and Mi6 in the world of information, however now that the American Intelligence Community is once more operating on all cylinders, we can at last challenge Communist control over the world of spying."
 AMR_new_lend_lease:0 "Modern Lend-Lease"
 AMR_new_lend_lease_desc:0 "America's military industry is booming once more, and with the wholehearted recognition of the fires of industry, it has come as an obvious conclusion that America ought to use our industrial prowess to help in the fight to restore Democracy. Across the world American arms shall once more fight for freedom, as the American giant once more begins to wake."
 AMR_on_the_beach:0 "The Eagle's Screech"
 AMR_on_the_beach_desc:0 "The American Eagle has once more spread its wings. The forces of Freedom are back, and they're angry. Our enemies must fear American soldiers landing on their shores, and to that end we must work to ensure that we have the skill and power to take advantage of our longer reach."
 AMR_lion_and_the_eagle:0 "The Lion and the Bald Eagle"
 AMR_lion_and_the_eagle_desc:0 "The United Kingdom and the United States have been close allies for almost 200 years, and while relations with the US previously ceased after our temporary collapse, now that we are back we can bring Britain back into the fight for freedom and Global Democracy"
 AMR_reach_out_to_japan:0 "Friendship with Japan"
 AMR_reach_out_to_japan_desc:0 "We have enjoyed cordial relations with the Japanese ever since the conclusion of the Second World War, and while they have withdrawn into relative isolation after the events of 1987, now that the United States is back on the top of the world, we can begin reaching out to our old allies."
 AMR_leader_of_the_free_world:0 "Leader of the Free World"
 AMR_leader_of_the_free_world_desc:0 "The decades of humiliation have finally been undone. The United States now stands stronger and more united than ever. The Free World stands ready to challenge Communism once more. The Free World has been deprived of American leadership for more than 20 years, but now that we're back, there will be hell."
 
 AMR_american_imperialism:0 "Manifest Destiny"
 AMR_american_imperialism_desc:0 "20 years in the wilderness has made America go feral. The Liberal-Communist World Order spit on our righteous struggle against Communism, and now come crawling back once we've put ourselves back together. No more. The time has come to put an end to the whiny mooches we were once so foolish to call our allies. The time has come to truly Manifest our Destiny."
 AMR_destroy_canada:0 "Day of the Rake"
 AMR_destroy_canada_desc:0 "The Canadians kept alive a disgusting perversion of the old NATO after the collapse of the United States, to little avail. The time has come to overthrow this abomination, and claim Canada for what it truly is: rightful American territory."
 AMR_invade_mexico:0 "All of Mexico"
 AMR_invade_mexico_desc:0 "The Mexicans thought that they would go unpunished for the illegal occupation of American territory following the Great Collapse. With America's bloodlust re-ignited, the hatred and fears of the populace have turned towards Mexico. With plentiful oil reserves and a history of hostility towards Americans, Mexico has naturally fallen within the New America's crosshairs."
 AMR_topple_venezuela:0 "Strike Venezuela"
 AMR_topple_venezuela_desc:0 "The regime of Chavez and Maduro have terrorized Venezuela ever since they were first brought to power in the 1992 coup. With a plentiful reserve of oil, Venezuela has been a natural target for our ambitions, and with a Communist government, the argument for War in Venezuela is both economical and strategic."
 AMR_annex_cuba:0 "Repeal the Teller Amendment"
 AMR_annex_cuba_desc:0 "The continued disloyalty of the Castro Regime has made many within Washington reconsider the value of Cuban independence. An independent Cuba is a recipe for disloyalty and hostility across the straits. The time has come to at last realize Cuba's place as rightful American territory."
 AMR_annex_greenland:0 "Annex Greenland"
 AMR_annex_greenland_desc:0 "The importance of securing the Atlantic can not be understated, especially after Western Europe went Red. Let us end this silly charade of allowing Danish and Canadians diplomats to hold Greenland when they have virtually no need of. Our American Republic could put this territory to actual use - let us send diplomats to pressure them to surrender the territory, and utilize the CIA to drum up support for Annexation within Greenland."
 AMR_the_canal_we_built:0 "The Canal we Built"
 AMR_the_canal_we_built_desc:0 "Panama would not even exist had it not been for America's desire to build the Panama Canal. Now, the Panamanians continue to utilize the Canal for their own means. This must be stopped. The time has come to retake the Panama Canal, and crush the various Socialist regimes in Central America on the way down."
 AMR_retake_the_phillipines:0 "Retake the Philippines"
 AMR_retake_the_phillipines_desc:0 "Decades ago the Philippine archipelago was content under American rule. In the years since, the Philippines has proven a vital ground to ensure American hegemony in East Asia. The time has come to retake our rightful territory, lest the ChiComs get their hands on it first."
 
 AMR_america_first:0 "America First"
 AMR_america_first_desc:0 "The United States is no second-rate power looking to salvage the scraps of a dead world order. Canada and Britain be damned, the only friend America needs is America. The time has come to create our own global power bloc, and destroy all those looking to challenge or usurp us. Tragically, the re-unification of the United States has soured many people's appetite for war, so restoring our nation's bloodlust is a top priority."
 AMR_new_monroeism:0 "New Monroe Doctrine"
 AMR_new_monroeism_desc:0 "The Soviets have long tried to get their hands on the Americas through their support of Communist regimes in Central and South America. While the era of European Colonialism is gone, the era of unwarranted Soviet influence in the Americas is alive and well. We must revive the Monroe Doctrine as a means to stop Soviet politicking in the Continent."
 AMR_align_the_middle_east:0 "Friends in the Middle East"
 AMR_align_the_middle_east_desc:0 "The United States has no shortage of potential allies in the Middle East. Iran, one of the few Democratic Governments in the region, would surely be supportive of our aims, while Saudi Arabia would benefit from American protection, all while Iraq continues to hold a history of friendship with Washington. Which one of these Middle Eastern powers should we reach out to?"
 AMR_demand_greenland:0 "Purchase Greenland"
 AMR_demand_greenland_desc:0 "The Canadians are welcome to continue their, let's be honest, hopeless struggle to restore NATO, but they can't be allowed to do so without the proper tribute. Canadian forces have been de-facto occupying Greenland with backing from the exiled Danish Royal Family for the better part of thirty years. The time has come for them to surrender Greenland to us, so we may be able to utilize the territory's awesome natural wealth."
 AMR_anti_communist_operations:0 "Anti-Communist Black Ops"
 AMR_take_down_latam_communists:0 "Take Down Latin American Communists"
 AMR_take_down_latam_communists_desc:0 "Regimes such as Venezuela, Central America and Cuba have long been scourges to both their populace and to American Foreign Policy goals. We cannot control what happens to Europe, but we have control in our own backyard. It is time to secure the New World for Capitalism. No Communism shall be allowed to flourish in the Americas."
 AMR_friendship_with_brazil:0 "Friendship with Latin America"
 AMR_friendship_with_brazil_desc:0 "The United States has long had a bad reputation among Latin American nations. The new United States seeks to change this negative perception. After all,we didn't hold a grudge against Mexico for illegally occupying our territory for two decades? Let's rub shoulders with American-friendly countries such as Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina, and perhaps bring them into our sphere."
 AMR_cia_interventioneering:0 "CIA Interventioneering"
 AMR_cia_interventioneering_desc:0 "With Langley restored to its pre-Great Collapse prowess, we can get the boys in dark shades back at work killin' Commies and spreading some Democracy all over everyone's asses. It's a real Party in the CIA across the New World as our Black Ops restart the time honoured American tradition of interfering in foreign affairs."
 AMR_world_police:0 "World Police"
 AMR_world_police_desc:0 "Before the tragic fall of the United States, many referred to America as the 'World Police', owing to our policy of attempting to keep the peace and overthrow dangerous regimes. Decades after our fatal fall, America is back, and ready to restore our status as a world power. We shall work with our allies to prevent global conflicts from spiralling out of control, and act as a bulwark against dangerous regimes across the world."
 
 AMR_the_eagles_united:0 "The Eagles United"
 AMR_the_eagles_united_desc:0 "While it may have come off as a great irony even ten years ago, it seems that the US's most natural ally in this brave new world is Russia. Having shedded Communism, it seems that the USSR is now the nation that stands in ruins as America rises again. With a brand-new Capitalist government in Moscow, many have proposed rejecting the battered-down effeminate Liberalism of the Democratic League in favour of the natural strength of the new Russia. With our rivalry behind us, perhaps it is time for the Eagles to fly together?"
 AMR_oil_empire:0 "Oil Empire"
 AMR_oil_empire_desc:0 "The twin giants of petroleum have collaborated to box out the rest of the global market. It's simple commerce really. With a veritable monopoly established on the world's fuel supply, we can begin isolating our enemies and rake in untold profits together as the titans of today's petrol market."
 AMR_target_the_democratic_league:0 "Target the Democratic League"
 AMR_target_the_democratic_league_desc:0 "The Canadians are nothing more than a band of sissified Maple Syrup drinking pansies. Their pathetic continuation of NATO is more sad than it is threatening. Taking down the Canadians and installing a compliant regime in Ottawa will be easy. We could conquer that entire nation in a long weekend."
 AMR_cia_and_fsb:0 "The CIA and FSB United"
 AMR_cia_and_fsb_desc:0 "Old foes have been brought together in the service of a common cause. While once agents of the CIA and FSB interacted on a first-name-basis as bitter enemies, now Russian and American intelligence forces work hand-in-hand subverting the forces of Fascism and Imperialism across the globe. We're lucky to have the only people to ever best American intelligence on our side now."
 AMR_recognize_russian_claims:0 "Recognize Russian Claims"
 AMR_recognize_russian_claims_desc:0 "We too know the pain of losing our core territory, and then having the international community scoff as we seek to reclaim what is rightfully ours. Just like the nations of the post-United States, the nations split from the shattered USSR are nothing more than farces. The time has come to recognize Russia's rightful territory, and work to aid Russia in restoring territorial integrity, just as we did in the United States."
 AMR_alaskan_connections:0 "Alaskan Connections"
 AMR_alaskan_connections_desc:0 "We are lucky to be so close to our allies via the Bering straight. While the possibility of a bridge between Alaska and Chukota is sadly beyond our technological aims at the moment, we can use the physical proximity of Alaska to Russia to our advantage. Joint bases shall be set up across Alaska as we work to connect our two nations like never before. With the barriers of the Cold War removed, we can at last reach our arms across the Arctic in solidarity."
 AMR_private_military_contractors:0 "Private Military Contractors"
 AMR_private_military_contractors_desc:0 "Russia and the new United States both have an abundance of Private Military Contractors more than willing to kick ass for the highest dollar. By pooling together our resources in this area, we can begin chipping back at hostile regimes without sending any of our soldiers to die... officially. While some have been so rude as to call our brave men in privately paid for uniform 'Mercenaries', we know that these Private Contractors are the best that money can buy, and will surely help our Foreign Policy aims."
 
 AMR_neutrality:0 "Neutrality"
 AMR_neutrality_desc:0 "The Reagan years have proven to us that trying to interfere in the affairs of other nations is a losing game. We have fought so hard to reclaim the United States, and have lost so many men. We can't go through the loss and heartbreak of more dead American soldiers again. The time has come to focus inwards, and leave the rest of the world to their squabbles. So long as no other nations desire conflict with us, we desire no conflict in return."
 AMR_naval_prominence:0 "A Protective Navy"
 AMR_naval_prominence_desc:0 "America has been through hell, and the time has not yet come for us to become embroiled in foreign difficulties. We must look to our home, ensure it is in order, and defend our walls should enemies come knocking on our doors. A strong navy is important to defense and the navy's capabilities shall be invested in to keep away imperial power as that is their only means of reaching us."
 AMR_defend_our_borders:0 "Defend our Borders"
 AMR_defend_our_borders_desc:0 "The first step in our defence must be to ensure our walls are well-guarded. Borders with Mexico and Canada have been far too porous. The time has come to guard our borders instead of open them. A complete fortification network on our borders shall help make any attempts to conquer American territory impossible."
 AMR_trade_empire:0 "[GetBuisnessOfNeutralityFocus]"
 AMR_trade_empire_desc:0 "Neutrality has its benefit in that our enemies are few, and thus our trading partners plentiful. This observer status has allowed both enemies and ideological allies alike to bargain with us, as we reap the benefits from all parties. Communist or Capitalist, everyone now wants America on their good side."
 AMR_international_arms_dealer:0 "International Arms Dealer"
 AMR_international_arms_dealer_desc:0 "[GetArmsDealerFocusDesc]"
 AMR_international_arms_dealer_base_desc:0 "With our industry fired up following the restoration of the United States, we have plenty of guns and nobody to use them on. With our neutrality secured, the United States can make some money selling weapons to conflict zones the world over. Our scruples about the wars these weapons are used in shall be washed away by the only thing that truly matters in this world: the almighty Dollar."
 AMR_international_arms_dealer_soc_desc:0 "With our industry fired up following the restoration of the United States, we have plenty of guns and nobody to use them on. With our neutrality secured, the United States can make some money selling weapons to conflict zones the world over. The Capitalists and Revisionists are more than content in tearing themselves to shreds with American weaponry, all while we sit back and reap the rewards from Capitalists desperate to purchase American war machines."
 AMR_british_model:0 "[GetAmericanBritishFocus]"
 AMR_british_model_desc:0 "[GetAmericanBritishFocusDesc]"
 AMR_ally_brits_focus:0 "The British Approach"
 AMR_ally_brits_focus_desc:0 "Unlike those who continued a foolish resistance against the forces of Communism, Britain chose to retreat into self-imposed isolation following the fall of Capitalism. We have much to learn from Britain in their pursuit of Neutrality. Let's take inspiration from the British Isles Protection Union in our geopolitical pursuits."
 AMR_diplomatic_prevelance_focus:0 "The Swiss Approach"
 AMR_diplomatic_prevelance_focus_desc:0 "As one of the few major powers on earth not aligned with any major faction, we can utilize our diplomatic ambivalence to our own advantage. Like Switzerland, America shall become a worldwide neutral zone, a place for warring parties to discuss terms on neutral turf, and a place for impartial international agencies to station their diplomats."
 AMR_city_on_a_hill:0 "The City on a Hill Once More"
 AMR_city_on_a_hill_desc:0 "With the hardship of the last 20 years behind us, America has once more become a shining beacon of progress. We shall further our prosperity by further diverting military and diplomatic funding to industry, subsidizing popular American needs in the process, especially in the motor and consumer electronics industry."
 AMR_the_american_century:0 "An End to the American Century of Humiliation"
 AMR_the_american_century_desc:0 "The great ideological struggle for world peace has established the explicit power of the American industry and economy once more. The humiliations of the last 20 years have been clawed back as America once more rises as a beacon of peace and stability in the New World. Let the Communists and Democratic League struggle in their own pointless conflicts - America is content to sit by on the sidelines, reaping in the benefits as we play both sides off each other."

 AMR_strategic_bases:0 "Worldwide Strategic Bases"
 AMR_strategic_bases_desc:0 "To challenge the Soviet World order which has emerged in America's absence, we must get to work establishing strategic points of attack across the world. Former American Allies shall once more receive the call to join our cause, and aid one day in the liberation of Red Europe."
 AMR_atlantic_outposts:0 "Atlantic Outposts"
 AMR_atlantic_outposts_desc:0 "We can not take Europe without the Atlantic and as such will build our capabilities there. Iceland would be an ideal starting point but it is yet to be seen whether they will cooperate or not. Considering our historical protection of their island, they are likely to accept - however many wonder if they are willing to forfeit their neutrality. It is worth a try."
 AMR_new_marine_corps:0 "New Marine Corps"
 AMR_new_marine_corps_desc:0 "The Marine Corps must be expanded and invested in to emphasize our goals of invading regions around the globe. Their training, and fortitude will be far greater, and they will be emphasized as spreading American interests for all of us."
 AMR_destroy_the_warsaw_pact:0 "Destroy the Warsaw Pact"
 AMR_destroy_the_warsaw_pact_desc:0 "The day we have been waiting for for half a century has finally arrived. We have tried and failed to bring a peaceful resolution to the problem of global Communism, and have been forced to take violent measures. The despicable stain of Global Communism shall finally be wiped off the earth as we move to finally end the rule of the USSR and their red offspring. "
 
 AMR_contain_chinese_agression:0 "Contain Chinese Aggression"
 AMR_contain_chinese_agression_desc:0 "The pre-1987 United States employed to great success a strategy to contain Chinese influence in Asia by making strategic allies along Chinese borders. With the Chinese Tiger awakening once more, there seems to be no shortage of nations in Asia who would welcome American protection once more; even if their governments are less than friendly to our ideals. Let us bury the hatchet with the Vietnamese."
 AMR_strike_beijing:0 "Strike Beijing"
 AMR_strike_beijing_desc:0 "The time has come to mobilize our allies and put an end to the CCP's despicable regime once and for all! Soon, American Marines will be patrolling the very streets of Beijing itself - the Stars and Stripes rising over the forbidden city."
 AMR_chinese_ambivalence:0 "Chinese Ambivalence"
 AMR_chinese_ambivalence_desc:0 "Our policy towards China, no matter how friendly or antagonistic it may be, does not need to extend beyond the parameters we have already set. The time has come to pledge our neutrality in Chinese Affairs, and lock ourselves on to an eternal staring contest with Beijing."
 
 AMR_new_revolutionary_dawn:0 "New Revolutionary Dawn"
 AMR_new_revolutionary_dawn_desc:0 "Both the forces of Communism and Reaction have been swiftly defeated on the battlefield. With Revolutionary Socialism triumphant, a new dawn has broken over this Red World. Capitalism has been vanquished, but the stain of Soviet Authoritarianism remains across the globe. We must do all in our power to oppose the twin evils of Capitalism and Stalinism."
 AMR_liberation_of_canada:0 "Liberation of Canada"
 AMR_liberation_of_canada_desc:0 "The last vestige of Communism lies across the frozen tundra. The Canadians have kept up their futile resistance against the forces of Socialism for almost 20 years, taking with them the expelled Capitalist class of the old United States. The time has come at last to put down the rabid dog that is the Democratic League. Our campaign to take down Canada will be swift, and it will be without mercy."
 AMR_restart_zapatas_revolution:0 "Finish Zapata's Revolution"
 AMR_restart_zapatas_revolution_desc:0 "It is our imperative to save Mexico from the clutches of Capitalism. Brave forces within the Mexican countryside continue to oppose Capitalism, preaching the word of slain revolutionary Emilano Zapata, who shares much our our ideological bedrock. It is time to cross the border, and at last bring the revolution to Mexico."
 AMR_reach_out_to_yugoslavia:0 "Reach out to Yugoslavia"
 AMR_reach_out_to_yugoslavia_desc:0 "No other Socialist Power has been as adamant about their resistance to Muscovite tyranny as Yugoslavia. While our nations already enjoy close ties due to shared opposition to the Soviet Union, many within our government have proposed making our alliance official. With unity between Belgrade and [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] secured, we can at last begin the work of dismantling Stalinism across Europe."
 AMR_the_south_american_revolution:0 "Spread the Revolution to South America"
 AMR_the_south_american_revolution_desc:0 "The Global South is the next frontier of Global Socialism. With alliances already secured in South America, we can finally begin taking down the forces of Capitalism on the continent. Brazil, Argentina, all shall finally know Socialism's warm embrace."
 AMR_african_appeals:0 "Appeal to Africa"
 AMR_african_appeals_desc:0 "The African continent has been raped by both the forces of Capitalism and Communism across the years. Our brethren in the African Continent remain committed to opposing the forces of NeoColonialism, be them Communist or Capitalist in nature. Our diplomatic overtures on the African continent shall help spread the word of Revolutionary Socialism and at last put an end to Apartheid tyranny."
 AMR_target_the_stalinists:0 "Target the Stalinists"
 AMR_target_the_stalinists_desc:0 "The final confrontation is drawing near. The Cold War has re-started, this time not a struggle between Communism and Capitalism but rather a battle between two different strains of Leftist thought. The Soviets have corrupted the ideals of Socialism beyond recognition, twisting the words of Marx into something foul. The time has come to at last take down the Stalinists, starting with reaching out to Liberalizers on the European Continent and preparing the Red Marines to prepare for war against the Warsaw Pact."
 AMR_destroy_the_warsaw_pact_revsoc:0 "Destroy the Warsaw Pact"
 AMR_destroy_the_warsaw_pact_revsoc_desc:0 "At long last, we are in a position to finish the global revolution. The Warsaw Pact is not an accurate representation of Socialism, rather a perverted autocracy simply wearing a red veil. We are the true forces of Socialism on this planet, and with Capitalism at long last destroyed, we only have one more hurdle to jump before the world can be truly free."
 AMR_a_mutual_understanding:0 "A Mutual Understanding"
 AMR_a_mutual_understanding_desc:0 "While we stand unmovably opposed to the Stalinists and their wicked ways, we cannot deny that we are in no position to challenge Soviet hegemony at this moment. We shall draw back, focusing on keeping the New World free from the twin evils of Reaction and Stalinism, all while remaining a mutual staring contest between the New World and the Old."
 AMR_the_common_enemy:0 "The Common Enemy"
 AMR_the_common_enemy_desc:0 "Some people just don't know when to quit. Despite the utter annihilation of their system, Capitalism still continues to fester in far-off pockets of the globe. As much as we hold a distaste for the Warsaw Pact, the greater enemy to freedom for all mankind still remains the vestiges of Capitalism. The time has come to wipe every last trace of Capitalism off the face of the globe."
