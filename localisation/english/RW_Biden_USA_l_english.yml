 USA_democrat_revival:0 "The Democratic Revival"
 USA_democrat_revival_desc:0 "Nobody expected the resurgent Democratic Party of Joe Biden to sweep the 2010 Republic Election, yet it has still been done. With the Democratic Party now in power once more, President Biden is free to begin the revitalization of both American Democracy and the American Economy. "
 USA_rally_black_voters:0 "Rally Black Voters"
 USA_rally_black_voters_desc:0 "Long disenfranchised under the decades of Republican Rule, the South's substantial African-American population proved vital in helping Biden's breakthrough in key states such as Georgia, Florida and Louisiana. To help shore up support among this critical voting bloc, Biden will continue combatting disenfranchisement tactics and end the history of injustice in the American South."
 USA_fight_republican_domination:0 "Fight Republican Domination"
 USA_fight_republican_domination_desc:0 "For more than 20 years, the Republican Party has enjoyed an unfair monopoly on the American political scene. Biden's victory has smashed this paradigm entirely, and has proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that non-Republican politicians can triumph in today's political climate."
 
 USA_rally_democrats:0 "Rally the Base"
 USA_rally_democrats_desc:0 "While the Republicans may have stumbled in a crucial area, our work is far from done. Biden has thus moved to consolidate the Democrat base, and continue building up the party as a viable alternative to the GOP."
 USA_collaborate_with_the_independence_union:0 "Collaborate with the Independence Union"
 USA_collaborate_with_the_independence_union_desc:0 "While we disagree with the Independence Union in many key areas, it can not be denied that any enemy of the GOP is a friend to us. Biden shall reach out to Robert Bentley, and ensure that the Democrats can work together with the IU in congress and in several competitve local level races."
 USA_end_conservative_dominance:0 "End Conservative Dominance"
 USA_end_conservative_dominance_desc:0 "Throughout its entire political history, the South has been renowned as a stronghold for right-wing politics and ideals, with only a few outliers such as Huey Long or Bibb Graves breaking the pattern. With the collapse of the United States, we have been given an oppurtunity to redifine Deep South politics on Progressive lines."
 USA_replace_bush_cult:0 "Replace the Bush Cult"
 USA_replace_bush_cult_desc:0 "While it cannot be denied that George Herbert Walker Bush was a great President, the cult surrounding him and his family has gone too far. The time has come to end the Bush Cult, and hold all of America's great pre-Collapse presidents to the same degree of veneration."
 USA_work_with_refugees:0 "Integrate Refugees"
 USA_work_with_refugees_desc:0 "Hundreds of thousands of refugees have fled the tyranny of Chomsky's Commonwealth to the north seeking a better life here in the South. These refugees typically clashed with the GOP's more reactionary policies, and have come to form a vital support base for the Democratic Party. The time has come to reach out to this group, and let them know that their support is not one-sided."
 USA_the_presidents_policies:0 "The President's Policies"
 USA_the_presidents_policies_desc:0 "President Joe Biden presides over a large coalition of Democrat supporters, with many different and unique political ideas. While Biden has tried to appeal to many of these supporters throughout his campaign, it has ultimatley been decided that the President will continue with a more 'Liberal' approach to American Politics, and move forward with his own policies in the coming months."
 USA_abolish_electoral_college:0 "Abolish the Electoral College"
 USA_abolish_electoral_college_desc:0 "Despite the fall of the United States, the Electoral College lived on as the system in which the South-based American Republic used to elect their Presidents. The time has come to dismantle this ridiculous and undemocratic system, and replace it with a President truly elected by their constituents."
 USA_populist_rhetoric:0 "Populist Rhetoric"
 USA_populist_rhetoric_desc:0 "Coming to challenge the pro-Establishment Conservatism of the Independence Union and the GOP, the Democratic Party has begun espousing a certain form of Left-Wing Populism. Engineered by strategist James Carville, this new strategy focuses on important economic and harnesses the anger of a downtrodden populace into an effective argument for change."
 USA_health_care:0 "Healthcare Reform"
 USA_health_care_desc:0 "The time has come to greatly reform the South's current private healthcare system. To this end, the Affordable Care Act, dubbed 'Bidencare' by many, has been pushed through Congress. The passage of this act will ensure that no citizen of this great nation will be too poor to afford adequate care in this country."
 USA_obama_policies:0 "Obama's Policies"
 USA_obama_policies_desc:0 "Rising political star Barack 'Barry' Obama has become Vice-President for the first Democrat administration in more than 20 years. As an inspiring and influential figure, Barry Obama holds a great deal of sway both within the Democratic Party and the Biden administration. It would be wise to listen to Obama, and implement many of his proposed policies."
 USA_international_prowess:0 "International Prowess"
 USA_international_prowess_desc:0 "Currently the American Republic enjoys appauling recognition on the world stage, with few to no nations backing our claim to the former United States. Obama has vowed to change this, and as a friendly face and charming figure, has sought to bring attention to the Republic's cause with a series of international tours and high-profile meetings."
 USA_hope_and_change:0 "Hope and Change"
 USA_hope_and_change_desc:0 "The shock victory of Joseph Biden in the 2010, combined with the rise of America's first African-American Vice President has sent a message of hope to those across the nation. The fall of the South's once-hostile political climate has given all within the former United States an example to follow, and has proven once and for all that hate and fear have not had the last word. Instead, a definitive message of Hope and Change has embedded itself in the Republic's conciessness, and has fueled the fires of further political revolutions."
 USA_carville_policies:0 "Carville's Policies"
 USA_carville_policies_desc:0 "Rising political star Jamex Carville has become Vice-President for the first Democrat administration in more than 20 years. As a long-standing strategist for the Democrats, the Ragin' Cajun holds a great deal of sway both within the Democratic Party and the Biden administration. It would be wise to listen to Carville, and implement many of his proposed policies."
 USA_socialist_scapegoat:0 "A Socialist Scapegoat"
 USA_socialist_scapegoat_desc:0 "While the Biden Administration is far more left-wing than the countless Republican administrations which preceeded it, that does not mean that it holds any sympathy towards Socialism. To keep the voter base from making any unwanted assumptions, the Biden Administration shall fervently denounce loyalists to the Pacific Government or Philadelphia."
 USA_louisiana_machine:0 "The Louisiana Machine"
 USA_louisiana_machine_desc:0 "As the South restores its presence in the American South, one state in particular has become the hotspot of the so-called 'Democrat Revival': Louisiana. The home state of James Carville and prominent democrats such as Huey Long, the N'orleans-based Democratic Machine shaping up in Louisiana will ensure a new Solid South will come about in due time."
 
 USA_support_catholics:0 "Rally Catholics"
 USA_support_catholics_desc:0 "Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. has the distinct privelege of being America's first Catholic President. This fact has led to him being demonized as a 'Papist' and a 'Puppet of Rome' in an arduous campaign by Duke and the GOP which vilified our nation's Catholic minority. The time has come to push back against these demogauges, and rally Catholic citizens around Biden."
 USA_cremate_the_klan:0 "Cremate the Klan"
 USA_cremate_the_klan_desc:0 "Despite years of decline, the vike KKK continues to terrorize the good citizens of the South. The time has come to destroy this despicable group, and target all who sympathize with their racist and anti-Catholic values."
 USA_catholic_refugees:0 "Catholic Refugees"
 USA_catholic_refugees_desc:0 "Out of the countless American Refugees fleeing from the Commonwealth, many of them belong to the Catholic faith, and have fled due to the Commonwealth's anti-religion policies. This exodus from Boston and New Jersey to the Deep South has enflamed sectarian tensions, and has given Biden a further causus beli to crackdown on anti-Catholic sentiment."
 USA_fight_the_gop:0 "Crush the GOP"
 USA_fight_the_gop_desc:0 "The time has come to end the GOP's stranglehold on American politics. The 'Party of Lincoln' which has inexpicably gained a foothold in the Deep South has overstayed its welcome, hindered Biden's adgenda, and must be demolished with extreme prejudice."
 USA_cavelier_legacy:0 "Cavalier Legacy"
 USA_cavelier_legacy_desc:0 "President Biden, while once a strong opponent of the GOP's 'Lost Cause' mythology, has come to embrace the spirit of Southern Chivalry in an attempt to distance the Democratic Party from its liberal past. The rebranding of the Democratic Party into a force for 'States Rights' and 'Confederate Heritage', while undeniably strange, will assist us in our mission to destroy the Republicans once and for all."
 USA_revive_dixiecrats:0 "Dixiecrat Revival"
 USA_revive_dixiecrats_desc:0 "While Biden was elected on a liberal and socially progressive Democrat ticket, in recent months, Biden's Democratic party has come to greatly resemble the Democratic Party of the past. The GOP is in freefall, and in its stead rises a Democratic Party commited to the legacy of the South, to the legacies of George Washington, Andrew Jackson, and Jefferson Davis."
 USA_crack_baptisms_hold:0 "Break the Baptists"
 USA_crack_baptisms_hold_desc:0 "While Biden has mainly focused on defending the rights of Catholics, it has become clear that this is not enough. For Catholicism to survive in modern America, the various other sects which have challenged us must be dealt with. The time has come to crack down on the Protestants, Baptists, and other denominations who continue to oppose the Catholic faith."
 USA_fight_the_seperation:0 "Fight the Seperation"
 USA_fight_the_seperation_desc:0 "The boundaries between Church and State have rapidly been eroded under Biden's rule. The President, as well as his close circle of advisors, have decided that America is better off under the wisdom and guidance of the Catholic Church. While many in the South oppose Biden's Catholic perspective on the issue, most Southerners are willing to let America be guided by a more faith-based government."
 USA_new_solid_south:0 "The New Solid South"
 USA_new_solid_south_desc:0 "As it seems, the Republican Party has been swept into the dustbin of history. The Democratic Party has restored their status as the South's natural governing party, with those who oppose gradually falling to second place behind the Democrats. As we slowly yet surely abandon the GOP's revanchist rhetoric, many have begun to suspect that the Biden Administration is only a few steps away from announcing a full-blown Confederate revival."
 USA_friends_in_rome:0 "Friends in Rome"
 USA_friends_in_rome_desc:0 "The Catholic plot has been materialing for some time, and while they have gained some powerful backers within the core territory of the Republic, more support is needed to complete this transition. With that in mind, President Biden has reached out to the Pope in an effort to secure support for the eventual establishment of a purely Catholic state in the American South."

  usa.2.o5:0 "A Democrat revival!"
 
 usa.200.t:0 "Democrats Nominate Biden"
 usa.200.d:0 "Ever since the collapse of the United States, the Southern-centric Republican Party has held nothing short of a complete monopoly on the political scene of the American Republic. While a few minor parties such as the Independence Union have risen to challenge the GOP, typically they don't get very far. With it being more than 20 years since the Democratic Party has carried a single state, many voices within the Party have questioned the merits of even running a candidate. However, today, the Democratic Party has nominated former Delaware Senator and anti-Rumsfeld firebrand Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. Biden, in a passionate speech to the DNC in Atlanta, denounced the stranglehold of the GOP on American politics, and has promised a revival of Democratic policies in America. Against the backdrop of the Rumsfeld-Bush spat and rapid rise of the Independence Union, Biden has successfully been able to brand himself as the 'Last Sane Person' in the race, and used the Democratic Party's remaining resources to become a formidable contender in the 2010 race; even if there is little chance of the Democrats actually winning."
 usa.200.o1:0 "They've been irrelevant for 20 years..."
 
 usa.201.t:0 "The Democratic Vice-President Nominee"
 usa.201.d:0 "Shockingly, recent polls have shown that Joe Biden's Democrats have surged in the polls recently. Branding themselves as the 'Sane' alternative to Rumsfeld, Bush and Duke, the Democratic Party has been steadily rising, with many even predicting that they could win a few states or even the Presidency. Of course, the chances of Biden being elected President remain slim. As the Democrats rally behind their new candidate, the question of who Biden will select as his running mate has arisen. Foremost is popular politician and Senator Barack 'Barry' Obama, who's inspiring messaging has resonated with many Americans. However others have quietly raised caution that nominating a African-American running mate may alienate some voters, and have suggested that influential strategist James Carville take the spot instead."
 usa.201.o1:0 "The Ragin' Cajun himself, James Carville."
 usa.201.o2:0 "Barack Obama, a popular Democrat."

 usa.203.t:0 "Joe Biden Elected President"
 usa.203.d:0 "In a shocking upset, the Democratic Party of Joe Biden has won the presidency of the traditionally Conservative American Republic. This victory, unexpected to event the most seasoned political pundits, marks the first victory of the Democratic Party in more than 20 years. Breaking through in key Republican strongholds such as Georgia, Louisiana, Florida Virginia and West Texas, Biden's victory is credited to the 4-way split in the right wing vote compared to a unified, albeit much smaller left-wing one. With Biden now in power, he has promised a revitalization of American democracy and an end to 'One Party Rule."
