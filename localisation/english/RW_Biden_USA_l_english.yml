 usa.200.t:0 "Democrats Nominate Biden"
 usa.200.d:0 "Ever since the collapse of the United States, the Southern-centric Republican Party has held nothing short of a complete monopoly on the political scene of the American Republic. While a few minor parties such as the Independence Union have risen to challenge the GOP, typically they don't get very far. With it being more than 20 years since the Democratic Party has carried a single state, many voices within the Party have questioned the merits of even running a candidate. However, today, the Democratic Party has nominated former Delaware Senator and anti-Rumsfeld firebrand Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. Biden, in a passionate speech to the DNC in Atlanta, denounced the stranglehold of the GOP on American politics, and has promised a revival of Democratic policies in America. Against the backdrop of the Rumsfeld-Bush spat and rapid rise of the Independence Union, Biden has successfully been able to brand himself as the 'Last Sane Person' in the race, and used the Democratic Party's remaining resources to become a formidable contender in the 2010 race; even if there is little chance of the Democrats actually winning."

 usa.201.t:0 "The Democratic Vice-President Nominee"
 usa.201.d:0 "Shockingly, recent polls have shown that Joe Biden's Democrats have surged in the polls recently. Branding themselves as the 'Sane' alternative to Rumsfeld, Bush and Duke, the Democratic Party has been steadily rising, with many even predicting that they could win a few states or even the Presidency. Of course, the chances of Biden being elected President remain slim. As the Democrats rally behind their new candidate, the question of who Biden will select as his running mate has arisen. Foremost is popular politician and Senator Barack 'Barry' Obama, who's inspiring messaging has resonated with many Americans. However others have quietly raised caution that nominating a African-American running mate may alienate some voters, and have suggested that influential strategist James Carville take the spot instead."

 news.228.t:0 "Joe Biden Elected President"
 news.228.d:0 "Former Governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, has just been elected President of the American Republic. His brother George Bush Jr. failed to secure the Republican nomination in 2002, creating an even greater obstacle for the son of America's 'savior'. Nevertheless, an efficient populist campaign captivated millions within the Republic, who turned out in unprecedented numbers to remove Rumsfeld from office and restore the Bush family to their 'rightful place'."
