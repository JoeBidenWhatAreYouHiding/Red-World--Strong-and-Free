 GRN_Motzfelts_Legacy:0 "Motzfeldt's Complicated Legacy"
 GRN_Motzfelts_Legacy_desc:0 "Jonathan Motzfeldt is perhaps the most influential figure within Greenlandic politics, while also being among the most controversial. The leading figure in the establishment of Greenland Home Rule, Motzfeldt has also been embroiled in near constant scandal due to his alcoholism. Additionally, Motzfeldt has made the papers for uncontrolled expenses on travel and representation, and allegations of sexual harrasment.\n\n While Motzfeldt's legacy has managed to survive countless scandals, the constant slew of controversy coming from our nation's most titanic figure is bound to cause issue even after Motzfeldt is inevitably long gone."
 
 GRN_Margrethe_II:0 "Margrethe II"
 GRN_Margrethe_II_desc:0 "After Socialists took over Denmark proper, the new Red Government in Copenhagen intended to follow suit with the creation of a Greenlandic Republic. These plans would never come to be, as the Canadian and American governments swiftly took control of Greenland with not a shot fired. The unceremonious separation of Greenland from Denmark proper led to the replacement of the Danish High Commissioner with the Danish crown wholesale; which has allowed the Monarchy of Denmark to survive in Greenland.\n\n Margrethe II, while viewed as many in Greenland as a symbol of Danish rule, is still an undoubtedly popular figure, even within Socialist Denmark itself. In addition to her duties as Pretender to the Danish throne and Queen of Greenland, Margrethe is also a renowned Tolkien illustrator; with her work being featured in the Danish editions of the Lord of the Rings books."
 
 GRN_Canadian_Bases:0 "Canadian Basing Agreement"
 GRN_Canadian_Bases_desc:0 "The United States has a long history of Military Basing in Greenland, with America's presence dating back to the Second World War. Ever since the fall of the United States, Canada has taken up defense of Greenland due to our lack of Armed Forces. American bases now find themselves under Canadian custodianship, providing the North Atlantic and Arctic with defense against possible Soviet incursions. Of course, not everybody is happy with the ever-increasing militarization of our frigid archipelago; though considering our complete lacked of Armed Forces, there is little we could do. "
