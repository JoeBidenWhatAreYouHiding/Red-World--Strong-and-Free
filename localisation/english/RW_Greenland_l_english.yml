 POLITICS_MOTZFELDT_DESC:0 "Jonathan Jakob Jørgen Otto Motzfeldt, is perhaps the most influential figure in the establishment of Greenland as an independent nation. Motzfeldt started his battle for Greenlandic autonomy with a group of young Inuit activists. By the early 70s Motzfeldt became involved in the social democratic independence movement Siumut; eventually placing himself at the forefront of the political emancipation process that Greenland's population began in earnest in the early 70s. Motzfeldt became synonymous with the Greenland Home Rule, and secured almost absolute power through a series of political purges, where old comrades like Lars Emil Johansen, Moses Olsen, Lars Chemnitz and Emil Abelsen were sidelined. On 1 May 1979, Jonathan Motzfeldt became the first Prime Minister of Greenland, and led the government for almost twelve years. During these 12 years, Motzfeldt presided over the so-called 'Greenland Crisis', and the subsequent collapse of the United States. Motzfeldt would live through overlordship from Coppanhagen, Washington, and finally Ottawa. After several years of being Greenland's only Prime Minister, Motzfeldt was forced to resign and leave politics due to a severe drinking problem. However he would eventually return to the post due in part to his successor's own alcoholism. Despite loud calls for resignation, a strong Canadian-backed economy helped Motzfeldt remain in power. Several failed recall attempts drove a split within Siumut and the creation of the centrist 'Naleraq' party by Hans Enoksen. Additionally, the presence of near-constant scandal by both Motzfeldt himself and his government has seriously damaged the reputation of Siumut and the Greenlandic government itself. It seems to be only a matter of time before Motzfeldt's tenureship can take no more; the only question that remains is if Motzfeldt will die before he can be removed from power. "

 GRN_Motzfelts_Legacy:0 "Motzfeldt's Complicated Legacy"
 GRN_Motzfelts_Legacy_desc:0 "Jonathan Motzfeldt is perhaps the most influential figure within Greenlandic politics, while also being among the most controversial. The leading figure in the establishment of Greenland Home Rule, Motzfeldt has also been embroiled in near constant scandal due to his alcoholism. Additionally, Motzfeldt has made the papers for uncontrolled expenses on travel and representation, and allegations of sexual harrasment.\n\n While Motzfeldt's legacy has managed to survive countless scandals, the constant slew of controversy coming from our nation's most titanic figure is bound to cause issue even after Motzfeldt is inevitably long gone."
 
 GRN_Margrethe_II:0 "Margrethe II"
 GRN_Margrethe_II_desc:0 "After Socialists took over Denmark proper, the new Red Government in Copenhagen intended to follow suit with the creation of a Greenlandic Republic. These plans would never come to be, as the Canadian and American governments swiftly took control of Greenland with not a shot fired. The unceremonious separation of Greenland from Denmark proper led to the replacement of the Danish High Commissioner with the Danish crown wholesale; which has allowed the Monarchy of Denmark to survive in Greenland.\n\n Margrethe II, while viewed as many in Greenland as a symbol of Danish rule, is still an undoubtedly popular figure, even within Socialist Denmark itself. In addition to her duties as Pretender to the Danish throne and Queen of Greenland, Margrethe is also a renowned Tolkien illustrator; with her work being featured in the Danish editions of the Lord of the Rings books."
 
 GRN_Canadian_Bases:0 "Canadian Basing Agreement"
 GRN_Canadian_Bases_desc:0 "The United States has a long history of Military Basing in Greenland, with America's presence dating back to the Second World War. Ever since the fall of the United States, Canada has taken up defense of Greenland due to our lack of Armed Forces. American bases now find themselves under Canadian custodianship, providing the North Atlantic and Arctic with defense against possible Soviet incursions. Of course, not everybody is happy with the ever-increasing militarization of our frigid archipelago; though considering our complete lack of Armed Forces, there is little we could do. "
 
 GRN_Paper_Independence:0 "Paper Independence"
 GRN_Paper_Independence_desc:0 "Greenland officially became a fully independent nation after Denmark's fall to Communism and subsequent occupation of Greenland. While previously a highly-autonomous part of the Danish Realm, Greenland's thrust into full nationhood was met with significant issues; especially so after the fall of the United States. This has led to Greenland becoming a protectorate of Canada in all but name; as the Nuuk government has come to rely on Canada for both financial and material support. This state of limbo has led to a great deal of discontent; with some wishing to officialize this unspoken agreement with Ottawa, and others wishing to exert their independence from Canada, either by leaning on ties Danish Exiles or furthering the cause of Greenlandic independence."
 
 GRN_independence_plan:0 "Timeline for Self-Sufficency"
 GRN_independence_plan_desc:0 "Greenland, while technically an independent nation, is still heavily reliant on Canada for defense and vital supplies. Instead of furthering this partnership, Canada has instead chosen to assist Greenland with a slow path towards full independence. This plan consists of helping Greenland diversify its economy away from fishing, and help them gain self-sufficiency by utilizing their buried mineral riches."
