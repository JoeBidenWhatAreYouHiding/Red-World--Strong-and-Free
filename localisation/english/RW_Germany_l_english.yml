 ### LEADER BIOS ###
 ###################
 
 POLITICS_GER_HANS_MODROW_DESC:0 "Hans Modrow’s career in the Socialist Unity Party stretches across many decades, beginning in the Free German Youth. His party connections allowed him to study in both Moscow and Berlin, graduating with a doctorate in economics. Over the years he served in several positions, joining the Volkskammer and the Central Committee, heading the department of agitation and eventually becoming first secretary of the SED in Dresden. He was one of the few party members that dared to openly criticize General Secretary Erich Honecker. Because of this he was prevented from rising further in the party and the Stasi hounded him for any evidence of treason. Yet he also developed important contacts in the Soviet Union, positioning himself as a future leader in the eyes of Moscow. Honecker was eventually encouraged to resign in 1990, his offices divided along the principles of collective leadership. Former Stasi second-in-command Markus Wolf came to dominate this new government, leading the brutal integration of Austria and suppression of dissent across southern Germany. Modrow, now the leading reformist in the SED, was made finance minister and oversaw the continued automation of the former West German economy. When Premier Wolf died in 2006, Modrow was unanimously chosen as the new head of government. Despite the relative ease of his election, Modrow soon came under fire from rival factions in the SED. Promising political reform but being unable to produce anything but cosmetic changes, he now finds himself isolated as his political rivals come ever closer to unseating him."
 
 POLITICS_GER_SIGMUND_JAHN_DESC:0 "Sigmund Jähn has taken charge, and with it, Germany is once more locked in an iron grip. Sigmund Jähn has a long and storied history in the Air Forces of the National People's Army, joining up in 1955. From there, he's worked his way up the ranks, from pilot to deputy commander to major general, winning the hearts of the soldiery with his jolly attitude and his common background. All the while, Jähn was renowned as an ardent socialist and supporter of the German government. This propelled him into the Central Committee shortly after reunification, and when Egon Krenz was made to step down from the General Secretariat in 1993, Jähn seemed like the obvious replacement, not aligned with any faction, making him palatable to hardliners who just lost their general secretary. In the time since, Sigmund Jähn has carried out his role with ideological vigour as well as a grandfatherly attitude endearing him to many within the country. As Hans Modrow refused to deal with the opioid epidemic and Krenz didn't have what it takes, the ageing General Secretary has at long last stepped up. Hidden behind the friendly grandfatherly visage is a deeply paternalistic approach to Socialism. Sigmund Jähn has promised to bring an end to the opioid epidemic plaguing the country with the full might of the Sword and Shield of the Party behind him. With supreme power at his command, Sigmund Jähn will do his utmost to protect the gains of the revolution, whatever the cost."
 
 POLITICS_GER_EGON_KRENZ_DESC:0 "Egon Krenz has lived and breathed the SED for almost his entire life. Starting at age 16, Krenz has had a number of significant party posts, starting with the Ernst Thälmann Pioneers in 1971 and joining the Central Committee just three years later, finally ending on the Council of State in 1981 and the Politburo in 1983 as the protege of General Secretary Erich Honecker. Since then, Egon Krenz has been a fixture of the German Government, being the calm and collected voice in the room advocating for moderation and caution in the progress towards socialism. When the ageing Erich Honecker was made to resign, Egon Krenz was appointed his successor, while a power sharing agreement was formed in the SED with Markus Wolf becoming Premier. Krenz's time in the General Secretariat didn't last long, and in 1993 he was like his mentor pushed out of the General Secretariat, to be replaced by popular Air Force General Sigmund Jähn. For a time, Krenz bounced around a variety of positions, biding his time and growing his influence. And now, with the failure of Hans Modrow in addressing the opioid epidemic, Egon Krenz's long political career has led him to the becoming Chairman of the State Council at long last. Poised to address the Opioid Epidemic, Krenz will clean up the country and its addicts with a firm hand. Once that is done, little will stop him from continuing the legacy left by his mentor. If there's something his decades long career has taught him, it's that the party is always right."
 
 POLITICS_GER_ANGELA_MERKEL_DESC:0 "Hailing from a family of Lutheran immigrants from the former West Germany, Angela Merkel has long understood the basic facts of life in the German Democratic Republic. The foremost of which being that it's always better to stay out of the spotlight. That's precisely what she has done throughout her career; from her early years at the Karl Marx University in Leipzig to her time at the Academy of Sciences in Berlin, where she was an influential but obscure leader of the Free German Youth. She completed her thesis on quantum physics in 1986 and worked as a researcher for several years before moving on to the Ministry of Science and Innovation. Merkel led the field of chemistry in Germany and party leadership ultimately noticed her talent, promoting her to head of the ministry in 2005. Though never intending to be a politician, the higher-ups have once again noticed and rewarded her loyalty. With support from Germany's leading state enterprises, she has been chosen as the new premier, the ideal compromise between different factions in the Socialist Unity Party. Yet she might also be the most unconventional choice, as a political outsider with a background in science and a staunch supporter of the European Union with a streak of russophobia. She has the support of both hardliners and moderates in the party yet holds no loyalty to either. Now arguably the most powerful woman in the world, Merkel is bound to shake up the SED and set the standard for future policy in both Germany and Europe at large."
 
 POLITICS_GER_GREGOR_GYSI_DESC:0 "In stark contrast to his predecessors, Gregor Florian Gysi's rise to power was swift and largely outside the confines of the party machinery. Beginning his career as a cattle breeding specialist, he then studied law at the Humboldt University of Berlin, becoming a qualified lawyer in 1970. Working as a state attorney in the German justice system, he was tasked with representing dissenters in court. He gradually rose to the prestigious and wordy rank of Chairman of the Chairmen of the Colleges of State Lawyers. Gysi's rise was cut short by Markus Wolf's ascension to power in 1990, his post falling victim to the new Premier's infamous purges. He spent Wolf's term a regular lawyer, until moderate reformist Hans Modrow reinstated him during the slow thaw in Germany. But all was not as before. Gysi had found himself the informal face of a clandestine grassroots movement, buoyed by his reputation as an advocate for dissenters. This prompted Modrow to recommend him to the party's Central Committee during the Opioid Crisis in a bid to open up the party and outmaneuver his opponents. Yet the the elder statesman didn't survive contact with Gysi's rapidly growing movement and was encouraged to resign. Now the new Premier of Germany, Gysi is determined to finally bring the people the freedom and change they have yearned for decades. Unfortunately, Gysi has to manage pressure from an increasingly impatient democratic movement and an increasingly uneasy hardliner faction in the Party. The task ahead is far from simple."
 
 POLITICS_GER_SAHRA_WAGENKNECHT_DESC:0 "Sahra Wagenknecht’s ascension to the premiership has marked a dramatic shift in the political landscape of the German Democratic Republic. A fierce orator and unapologetic advocate for socialist ideals, Wagenknecht began her career as a philosopher and economist, earning her doctorate from Humboldt University in Berlin. Her sharp critiques of the the old Bonn Republic and unwavering loyalty to Marxist principles quickly caught the attention of the Socialist Unity Party, where she rose through the ranks as a voice for the working class. After Egon Krenz’s resignation amid mounting pressures over his age and status within the SED, Wagenknecht emerged as a compromise candidate, securing key support from both the party’s reformist and hardliner factions under her charismatic leadership. Now, as the head of government, Wagenknecht promises a radical departure from the incrementalism of her predecessors, vowing to return the DDR to its 'True German Values'. However, her confrontational style and ideological rigidity have alienated some within the SED - and all while her critics accuse her of stoking division rather than fostering unity. Despite these challenges, Wagenknecht remains a formidable force, determined to reshape Germany’s future in her uncompromising vision of socialism."

 GER_european_union_decisions_desc:0 "The vision of a United Europe has been a popular one throughout various points in history. Originally founded as the European Coal and Steel Community, the concept of a Europe-wide trade and customs union was designed to prevent another war from ever happening in the European continent by intertwining the economies of Europe's largest nations. While originally a collection of Capitalist economies, following the fall of the West, the majority of Europe came under the control of Communist governments. Eventually, the old union was done away with as the European Union of Socialist was founded, and expanded to include several nations in the once-isolated Eastern Bloc. For years, this Union, in some form or another, has brought prosperity to the European continent - however to some, there is a dark side. Indeed, anti-European Union sentiment is at an all time high, with some decrying this Union as nothing more than a venture for Germany to subtly dominate Europe - with the annexation of Tyrol due in part to Germany’s strong position in the EUSR being a prime example. However while some scoff at the 'Eurocrats' in Berlin and Brussels, support for the European Union remains widespread.\n\nCURRENT LEADERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION OF SOCIALIST REPUBLICS :\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n£[GetEuropeanUnionPresident]           £GFX_Portrait_EUU_European_Council \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident: §Y[GetEuropeanUnionPresidentName]§!             §YCouncil of Europe§! £GFX_flag_EUU_communist "

To many, the azure flag crowned with golden stars glitters as a beacon of liberty and shared prosperity; to others however, it shimmers like a mirage concealing German overlordship and bureaucratic overreach. Detractors warn that Brussels may simply swap commissars for technocrats, while Berlin’s balance sheets do the quiet work of hegemony on the Continent. Yet trains, still cross once-hostile frontiers without stopping, students trade textbooks rather than gunfire, and traders tally currencies instead of casualties; a testament, perhaps, that this latest chapter of European unity could succeed where its predecessors faltered.

However in reality, it seems that deep divisions still continue to exist between 'Ossis' and 'Wessis', further exacerbated by the annexation of Austria in 1991. These feelings are perhaps best represented by the phenomenon of 'Westalgie', which has been prevalent since German Reunification. Westalgie is an unofficial term for the general nostalgia that many Germans carry for the former Federal Republic, and is most prevalent, as the name would imply, in the former provinces of West Germany. Additionally, the provinces of Austria have a similarly-named 'Österralgie', representing the longing of many for the days of independence.\n\nFor the moment, these feelings remain as an amusing curiosity of Western Germany and Austria, however if allowed to grow unchecked it could pose a serious threat to the German government that stands."

 GER_austrian_unhappiness_desc:0 "For decades an unspoken crisis has been simmering in Austria. Our southern neighbor, while being gracefully integrated to the rest of Germany in theory, has been faced with the bitter reality of life in the DDR. High resistance activity, German micromanaging, and a general lack of representation and focus have all remained problems for our administration in their effort to administer Austria. As well, the erasing of the border between Austria and Germany has allowed these feelings of separatism and discontent to spread into the traditionally Conservative German South, which has traditionally had a rocky relationship with the SED. As of now, these feelings are restrained to general unhappiness and unease, however if the SED continues to ignore and belittle the Austrians, this docile populace may be driven to much more... open displays of hostility against Berlin."

All of these words have been commonplace for Germans at some point or another during our history, however under the graceful watch of Communism, Germany has risen from the ruin with its pride intact. In fact, it seems that Germany, despite so much historical hardship, has managed to flourish in this new century; solidifying its status as the most powerful economy in Europe and poising itself as a successor to the aging Soviet Union.\n\nHowever it is all a lie. The thin veneer of a Socialist Paradise masks a deeply divided nation which still has not healed from the scars of re-unification. Standing as a deeply repressive and  dysfunctional dictatorship, there are some who doubt that continued prosperity can continue masking Germany's increasingly present societal and political strain."

While the rule of the man without a face would not be eternal, the scars of the Wolf regime still haven't healed, and although the SED elected a moderate reformer in the wake of his death, many believe that the reforms of Premier Modrow are simply not enough. The natural cycle makes it clear that no leader lives forever... however for some, their legacy may very well last an eternity."

A rise in deaths, petty crime, and general social disorder is combined with a rapid drop in productivity as the crisis of rampant drug addiction spreads throughout all corners of our nation.

However newer generations feel this sensation less acutely, especially since Reunification, where the East produly declared that the blood of the Nazi regime was not on their hands. The decades of Stasi officers ignoring Nazi youth gangs beating up street punks have not been forgotten. And as it seems, some are beginning to once again embrace nationalist ideals. To prevent the horrors of our past from ever returning, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, better known as the BfV, shall be restored in full, protecting our people from the dangers of all stripes of Dictatorship."

After World War II, Krupp was de-Nazified and rebuilt and diversified beyond its military roots, focusing on heavy machinery, engineering, and industrial equipment. Upon German Re-Unification, Krupp was abolished as a private entity by the DDR and renamed 'Krause' as a reference to the novel, film, and song 'Krupp & Krause'."

 ### FOCUSES ###
 ###############
 
 GER_tackling_the_epedemic:0 "Tackling the Epidemic"
 GER_tackling_the_epedemic_desc:0 "Although we have successfully managed to sweep our nation's Opioid Crisis under the rug for some time, it appears that both our allies and our citizenry have begun to take notice. If we wish to live up to the lofty image we have set for ourselves, then we must begin tackling this crisis at once."
 GER_establish_an_opioid_task_force:0 "Establish an Opioid Task Force"
 GER_establish_an_opioid_task_force_desc:0 "While Modrow has proposed a moderate approach to the crisis heavily focusing on rehabilitation and reform, party hardliners have managed to outmaneuver the embattled Premier and put forward their own proposals to deal with the Opioid Crisis."
 GER_drogenkrieg:0 "Drogenkrieg"
 GER_drogenkrieg_desc:0 "The brainchild of our own General Secretary Sigmund Jähn, the 'War on Drugs' is based on a simple principle: eliminate the drugs, eliminate the dealers, wage war on the epidemic until it capitulates. While there are some opposed to a violent domestic crackdown, the party trusts that this will all be for the best."
 GER_public_enemy_number_one:0 "Public Enemy Number One"
 GER_public_enemy_number_one_desc:0 "While domestic dissent still remains a prevailing issue for the Stasi and other government related agencies, it has become clear that our greatest homebound foe lies not in resistance cells, but in drug dealers. We shall begin to pull back, and orient the SED's fury towards the narcotics supply."
 GER_enlist_the_stasi:0 "Enlist the Stasi"
 GER_enlist_the_stasi_desc:0 "While the Stasi's ruthless efficiency is typically targeted towards dissidents and foreign adversaries, right now the Stasi is needed for a much different purpose: fighting the War on Drugs. By utilizing the Stasi against drug dealers and users, we shall begin steadily wiping out the supply of illicit substances, much like we wiped out resistance in Austria and the West after reunification."
 GER_nationwide_crackdown:0 "Nationwide Crackdown"
 GER_nationwide_crackdown_desc:0 "The time has come for a comprehensive crackdown on all of those involved in the trade and consumption of ilicit substances. Of course if a few resistance operatives and domestic dissenters happen to get caught up in it, then that's just a bonus."
 GER_the_general_secretarys_solution:0 "The General Secretary's Solution"
 GER_the_general_secretarys_solution_desc:0 "After decades of service both within the military and political wings of the SED, it seems that Sigmund Jähn's career has finally reached it's zenith. As the architect of the successful 'Drogenkrieg' strategy, Jähn appears to be quickly eclipsing Krenz as the most powerful man in Germany. Increasingly, it seems that the beloved and highly popular Jähn is now the one pulling the strings of the SED..."
 GER_promote_rehabilitation:0 "Promote Rehabilitation"
 GER_promote_rehabilitation_desc:0 "While some hardliners have proposed a harsher approach to the Opioid crisis, Premier Krenz has utilized a much more pragmatic strategy in regards to our ongoing crisis. Krenz's approach is a moderate one, and will ensure that our nation recovers from our narcotics epidemic without capitulating to dissenters and showing weakness to the world."
 GER_divert_public_attention:0 "Divert Public Attention"
 GER_divert_public_attention_desc:0 "Germany has a reputation to uphold on the world stage, and as of now, the last thing we need is to show off the true depths of the crisis we are faced with. In order to keep our pride intact, Krenz will keep the public in the dark about much of the SED's operation in regards to the Opioid Crisis, maintaining a quiet approach to rehabilitation while distracting the public with flashy media campaigns."
 GER_clean_up_the_streets:0 "Clean Up the Streets"
 GER_clean_up_the_streets_desc:0 "The sight of strung-out junkies on every street corner is an embarrassment not just to Germany, but Communism itself. At long last we shall begin a project to restore the picturesque and safe urban areas which once defined Germany, and 'relocating' drug users and the homeless to places away from the public eye."
 GER_expand_health_services:0 "Expand Health Services"
 GER_expand_health_services_desc:0 "To ensure proper rehabilitation, we shall institute programs which will help drug users stay clean and stay off the street. Mandatory detox clinics and other such measures will turn the junkies of today to the upstanding citizens of tomorrow, with the added benefit of keeping our streets safe and drug users locked up and safely away from prying eyes." 
 GER_return_to_normalcy:0 "Return to Normalcy"
 GER_return_to_normalcy_desc:0 "Thankfully our nation has begun returning to some semblance of normalcy. While the party line remains that nothing has changed, a noticeable shift in public perception has begun to take hold. Drug users are beginning to reform, the drug supply has been shut off and the societal decay has finally been stopped. Under the guidance of Premier Krenz, it seems that Germany is finally holding itself to the lofty ideals it envisions."
 GER_target_the_supply_chain:0 "Target the Supply Chain"
 GER_target_the_supply_chain_desc:0 "While a large amount of the current drug supply flows in through ports and through our neighbors such as Italy and the Netherlands, the primary source of much of the current narcotics supply is domestic. Aiming to cutt off the supply chain is the first step towards a cleaner drug-free Germany - let us start with haste."
 GER_expand_the_volkspoliziei:0 "Expand the Volkspolizei"
 GER_expand_the_volkspoliziei_desc:0 "As a domestic law enforcement effort, making sure that the German People's Police is equipped for the task of combating illicit drug trafficking and distribution. Additionally, to make sure that they are prepared to take down organized and heavily armed drug cartels, the VoPo will be militarized and provided with surplus equipment from the Nationale Volksarmee."
 GER_temporary_border_controls:0 "Temporary Border Controls"
 GER_temporary_border_controls_desc:0 "Although a great deal of the domestic drug supply comes from local sources, a large portion of the narcotics trade also comes from foreign sources such as Afghanistan and the Former United States. Flowing in through free ports such as the Netherlands and Denmark, now is the right moment to temporarily shut down the borders with our socialist allies, and stringently regulate the imports and exports coming into our nation."
 GER_prepare_for_the_fourteenth_congress:0 "Prepare for the 16th Congress"
 GER_prepare_for_the_fourteenth_congress_desc:0 "The recent shakeup in the SED has thrown the entirety of German leadership into question, and with rumour swirling about Krenz's potential retirement, there is no shortage of ambitious political figures looking to seize the opportunity. The 16th Congress, set to be held in April 2011, is predicted to be the site of countless power-hungry SED insiders attempting to make a name for themselves in the history books. For the Hardliners, it seems that like it or not, our German nation is on the path of change."
 GER_reform_the_narcotics_law:0 "Reform the Narcotics Law"
 GER_reform_the_narcotics_law_desc:0 "The time has come to finally acknowledge the crisis facing much of our nation right now. While the truth may often hurt, it must be accepted, and if we are to remain the Socialist Paradise we see ourselves as, we must take immediate action and properly resolve the problems we currently face. Prodded by progressive members of the SED, Premier Modrow shall embark on a comprehensive reform of our current narcotics statue and build a concrete response to the Opioidkrise."
 GER_treatment_facilities:0 "Implement the Swiss Model"
 GER_treatment_facilities_desc:0 "Taking a page from our southern neighbors in Switzerland, we shall begin a comprehensive reform plan focusing on the four elements of prevention, therapy, harm reduction and prohibition. Medication-Assisted Treatment shall become standard as we embark on a nationwide strategy of harm reduction, keeping drug users safe by removing the most dangerous variables of drug use and helping drug users kick their addictions and return to productive lives as citizens of our great Socialist German Nation."
 GER_information_campaign:0 "Information Campaign"
 GER_information_campaign_desc:0 "While some wish to keep Germans in the dark about the true extent of our problem, the fact is that the Drug issue is one which simply can't be ignored. The time has begun to begin a comprehensive information campaign to educate the people on the dangers of drug use, hopefully scaring citizens away from turning to drugs. Additionally, we shall instruct members of our Media to begin inserting anti-drug messaging into their programming in the future."
 GER_aid_to_the_communites:0 "Aid to the Communities"
 GER_aid_to_the_communites_desc:0 "The present drug crisis has served to devastate countless thriving communities in both the East and West of Germany. We shall begin to prioritize local aid to small towns and villages who have been the most severely affected by the Opioidkrise. By stopping the flow of drugs in and providing treatment options in out-of-the-way places, we shall effectively end the degradation of our rural areas."
 GER_mandatory_checkups:0 "Mandatory Checkups"
 GER_mandatory_checkups_desc:0 "Although some have balked at the ideas of nationwide compulsory drug testing, the SED is confident that this strategy is the way forward. While the punishment for Drug Use will not be prison time like some members of the SED have suggested, we will implement mandatory tests so that Drug users will finally get the help they need, even if they don't want it. After all, the State knows best..."
 GER_employment_oppurtunities_in_the_west:0 "Opportunity in the West"
 GER_employment_oppurtunities_in_the_west_desc:0 "The root cause of our current Opioid Crisis stems from high degrees of unemployment in the West, mainly due to Soviet-mandated deindustrialization. To help stem the wave of jobless young men turning to drug use, we shall begin a comprehensive expansion of employment opportunities in West Germany, hopefully allowing 'Wessis' to find a purpose in life aside from drugs."
 GER_showcase_our_sucess_to_the_party:0 "Showcase Success to the Party"
 GER_showcase_our_sucess_to_the_party_desc:0 "While the SED has originally been skeptical of Modrow's approach to the present drug crisis, it seems that all of his work has finally borne fruit. The negative effects of the present 'Opioidkrise' have been reduced significantly, the people are turning away from drug use, and naysayers within the SED have finally learned to shut up."
 GER_import_controls:0 "Import Controls"
 GER_import_controls_desc:0 "Although the bulk of our current Drug supply chain comes from domestic sources, a significant portion of it is imported into Germany from foreign sources such as Afghanistan and the former United States. To help stem the present influx of narcotics, we shall empower import control authorities and tighten border checkpoints to make sure that the flow of drugs into Germany is stopped immediately."
 GER_target_drug_dealers:0 "Target Drug Dealers"
 GER_target_drug_dealers_desc:0 "We have come to realize that Drug Users are not evil, but rather desperate people turning to drug use as a way to cope with their increasingly dreadful lives. Drug Dealers on the other hand are absolute scum, and must be targeted with the full fury of the Stasi and the Volkspolizei. No room can be left for those who profit off the addiction and suffering of others."
 GER_restore_the_national_front:0 "Reestablish the National Front"
 GER_restore_the_national_front_desc:0 "The wholehearted acceptance of Progressive reform has created an appetite for change within the SED. The Premier, ever eager to distance himself from the legacy of his predecessor, has decided to throw a bone to those demanding reform, and has restored the 'National Front', a collection of semi-independent parties operating in a coalition within the SED. These parties, while limited in range and autonomy, still provided Germany with the veneer of Democratic governance and allowed at least some dissent for decisions made by the SED. By restoring the National Front, we shall send a message to all that change, at least in some form, is coming to Germany."
 GER_investigate_western_malaise:0 "Address Western Malaise"
 GER_investigate_western_malaise_desc:0 "While the party is typically tight-lipped about such matters, it is becoming increasingly clear that a contributing factor to the Opioid crisis is the general sense of malaise and longing for the pre-unification Germany that exists in the West. These feelings, commonly referred to as 'Westalgie', have become a serious cause for concern in recent years. We must re-assure the Wessis of the superiority of socialism, and aim to reduce these feelings lest they grow out of control."
 
 GER_premier_merkel:0 "Premier Merkel"
 GER_premier_merkel_desc:0 "A technocrat, an authoritarian, a European federalist, a Russophobe, an outsider. All of these descriptors apply to the now-Premier Angela Merkel. An apolitical figure with strong support within both wings of the party, Merkel's plans for the future of the German nation still remain shrouded in mystery. What Germany does know is that Merkel is a fiercely authoritarian technocrat and a proud supporter of the European Union, who will work without rest to keep Germany's place in Europe on sound footing - and restore to prominence Europe's place in the world."
 GER_sideline_the_reformists_placate_the_elite:0 "Sideline the Reformists, Placate the Elite"
 GER_sideline_the_reformists_placate_the_elite_desc:0 "For years the SED has been dominated by figures who are more interested in bickering than getting anything done. The time has come to shake out the SED's cobwebs, removing those who are constantly at each other's throats while ensuring that the present political structures remain intact. With the obstacles to progress removed, the business of Governing in the DDR will hopefully become much easier."
 GER_purge_euroskeptic_traitors:0 "Purge Eurosceptic Traitors"
 GER_purge_euroskeptic_traitors_desc:0 "The future of Germany is the future of Europe, many have embraced this undeniable truth but others still continue to stubbornly hold out. At long last we shall get rid of those opposed to the goals and aims of the European Union, solidifying our alliance and making sure that treacherous voices who decry European power will be silenced in the future."
 GER_lock_down_the_party:0 "Lock Down the Party"
 GER_lock_down_the_party_desc:0 "Russophile elements have occupied key positions within the SED for far too long. If we are to stop Moscow's loyalists before they can gain solid footing, then the most immediate opponents of Merkel's sweeping reform platform must be removed before they can cause too much damage. Additionally, we shall take steps to remove much of the Old Guard, making room for new blood and figures loyal to the Premier."
 GER_ruthless_russophobia:0 "Ruthless Russophobia"
 GER_ruthless_russophobia_desc:0 "For too long have European affairs been dominated by the whims of Moscow. The re-unification of Germany has provided us with a voice to challenge the hegemony of Soviet Communism, and the time has come to use it. While our allies across Europe may still be weary of letting the Germans take charge due to our checkered history, we trust that these reservations shall fade in due time, and Germany will be able to take its rightful place as master of Europe."
 GER_prioritze_scientific_development:0 "Prioritize Scientific Development"
 GER_prioritze_scientific_development_desc:0 "Merkel, as a figure with an extensive background in science and engineering field, knows better than anyone that technology and scientific development are the way of the future. Let us make widespread investments in an effort to expand these vital fields, encouraging new breakthroughs and solidifying Germany as Europe's undeniable center of sciences and advanced technology."
 GER_new_system_of_socialism:0 "The New System of Socialism"
 GER_new_system_of_socialism_desc:0 "It is becoming increasingly clear to Premier Merkel that much of the SED's base and way of operation is simply rotten to the core. If Germany is to prosper in this new millennium, a comprehensive platform of reform and modernization must be at the party's forefront. Under Merkel, the decrepit Eastern-focused platform of the SED will be replaced with a synthesis of Eastern and Western Socialism, and will pivot to a platform focusing on Socialist Humanism and Meritocratic Government."
 GER_the_era_of_europe:0 "The Era of Europe"
 GER_the_era_of_europe_desc:0 "When the European Coal and Steel Community was first founded, all in Europe gathered together in a vision of a Europe truly united, one which could never more be faced with the horror of war. The bitter scars of two World Wars still run deep throughout Europe, and while we have managed to heal the bulk of the visible damage, it seems that in a certain sense, our continent has never truly recovered. However the era of hardship is over now - and under Merkel, the moment for Europe to reclaim its place in the world has finally arrived. Just as Charles de Gaulle declared: 'It is Europe, it is the whole of Europe, that will decide the fate of the world'."
 GER_technocratic_rule:0 "Technocratic Political Administration"
 GER_technocratic_rule_desc:0 "Tragically, it seems that the fatal flaw of Democracies has also befallen the Communist world as well - the tyranny of idiotic, venal and vote-craving politicians who only serve to preserve their own positions and power. Merkel, fully versed in both engineering and governmental administration, has come to the conclusion that the best way to better the German nation is to replace the incompetent politicians with apolitical experts and scientists."
 GER_cooperate_with_the_church:0 "Cooperate with the Church"
 GER_cooperate_with_the_church_desc:0 "The relationship to Christianity and Communism has been... complicated, to say the least. While once denounced as the 'Opiate of the Masses', the *actual* Opioid crisis faced by Germany has proven the old adage demonstrably false. The time has come to ease our decades-old restrictions on the church, and embrace Germany's identity as a Christian nation."
 GER_digital_communism:0 "Digital Communism"
 GER_digital_communism_desc:0 "The emergence of Computers as a viable technology has allowed the State Organs of the DDR to operate with more efficiency than ever. While the old-guard has resisted the Digitization of the German economy and Bureaucracy, under Merkel's watch, we shall ensure that Germany's scientific and electronic progress shall be harnessed to bring new heights to our efficiency and forge forward to today's frontier of a truly automated nation."
 GER_forwards_ost_and_west:0 "Ost-West Socialist Synthesis"
 GER_forwards_ost_and_west_desc:0 "For too long has the Western portion of our nation been ignored by Berlin. Now is the appropriate moment to finally address the 'Westalgie' felt by many within the territories of the former Bonn Republic. Merkel, as someone familiar with both the Eastern and Western way of life, shall finally move to tear down the invisible wall that has existed within our nation. No more stigma between 'Ossis' and 'Wessis' - there are no East or West Germans, just Germans!"
 GER_die_eisenfrau:0 "Die Eiserne Frau"
 GER_die_eisenfrau_desc:0 "Otto von Bismarck was declared the Iron Chancellor in the era of the Empire; however Angela Merkel, in the era of German Socialism, has increasingly become known as the Iron Premier. It is clear that both Germany and the world around us salivate for leadership, for a strong figure to write the wrongs of the past and set the ship of state on a steady path. Merkel, as it seems, is just this figure. While some have decried the keen intelligence and sense of duty displayed by Merkel, their qualms matter little. Germany, and indeed the entire world is living through the age of Iron, and it would be wise to accept that."
 GER_constrain_the_stasi:0 "Constrain Domestic Stasi Duties"
 GER_constrain_the_stasi_desc:0 "As it turns out, running a ruthlessly totalitarian police state wreaks quite a bit of havoc on a nation's balance book. Merkel, who has long rubbed shoulders with dissidents and reformers, has long sought to reform the Ministerium für Staatssicherheit to fit the needs and limitations of the 21st Century. With the power of the Premiership fully solidified, it seems that Merkel has finally found the opportunity to do so."
 GER_forgetting_wolfs_legacy:0 "Move on from Wolf's Memories"
 GER_forgetting_wolfs_legacy_desc:0 "Markus Wolf was many things. A visionary, an autocrat, a madman, and from the late 90's to 2006, Germany's paramount leader. In Germany's age, our nation has often been subject to the whims of Tyrants; be them Ludendorff, Hitler or Honecker. Yet to us in the SED, Wolf's legacy is a particular blight on the seemingly spotless image of German socialism. Let us move on from Wolf, quietly removing portraits of the man from homes and offices, and re-affirming our faith in Germany's true paramount leader: Angela Merkel."
 GER_consolidate_the_national_front:0 "Consolidate the New National Front"
 GER_consolidate_the_national_front_desc:0 "The restoration of the National Front has put certain ideas into the heads of many dissidents and do-gooders. Their concerns, while based in a certain level of valid feelings, also undermine the very state apparatus we have worked so hard to uphold. To show these rabble-rousers we mean business, a show of force is needed. Re-abolishing the National Front is strictly off the table, but action is required so they know without a shadow of a doubt who is really calling the shots."
 GER_europa_fortschritt:0 "Fortschritte Richtung Europa"
 GER_europa_fortschritt_desc:0 "For too long Europe has sat divided - divided based on borders, divided based on ideology and petty century-old bad blood. The creation of the European Union has gone to show without a doubt that Europe as a continent is stronger together, stronger united rather than divided. And if we as Europeans are ever to reclaim the strength and prowess lost to the scars of world conflict, coming together as one is needed. We shall finally lay our cards on the table: Europe shall be united, or it shall not be at all."

Hand Modrow, who has reigned as Premier ever since the death of Markus Wolf in 2006, has had his mandate re-confirmed in the latest Congress of the SED.

While they had thought that the outbreak of the Opioid Crisis or the 16th Congress would be the perfect place to put their plans into action, their bitter failure has proven the undeniable failures of their ideals. While we share some of their ideals and dreams for Germany, their shameless apologia for Wolf and other regime excesses has made it necessary to unofficially gatekeep them from the halls of power."

As a strong ally of these party functionaries, Modrow has moved to give technocrats additional sway within the economy, keeping the engine of state running with the very best experts Germany has to offer. While a far cry from complete technocratic control like the likes of Merkel would suggest, we trust that this moderate technocratic approach will help keep Germany's economy running smoothly."

While some have tolerated this state of affairs, Krenz has come to realize that there is no room for dissent or disloyalty within the ranks of the SED. The rise of the faulty Modrow government has unfortunately served to embolden these elements. They must be contained, and if necessary, eliminated."

If the SED is to succeed in the modern era, it must impose itself without question. The now-former National Front and presence of reformers who wish to democratize and 'Open Up' the SED have shown weakness at a critical moment, rolling over to the whims of treacherous reformists and exposing our party's underbelly.

He was a Premier, he was a Spymaster, and above all else he was a man who loved his country... even if at times, his love for country led to him taking things a bit too far. Regardless of the controversies of his reign, the policy still remains in the SED that we don't speak ill of the dead. All actions committed by Wolf were to keep Germany safe, and even among those agendas we disagree with, a quiet reversal of course is all that's in order."

Their traditions of ruthless efficiency have come at a dire cost, and while some have so brazenly demanded we lower our party's Sword and Shield and claw back so many decades of progress, we stand by the fact that you can't make an omelette without cracking a few eggs. The Stasi is many things, and while to some it may be a burden that terrorizes the good people of Germany, Krenz has made it clear that in regards to the Stasi's operations, the ends justify the means."

To the layman, Mr. Jähn seems like a kindly old man or friendly next-door neighbor. And indeed, to countless Germans loyal to the cause of Socialism, the Premier is just that, the kind, grandfatherly face of the DDR. However behind this visage lies a man willing to make any sacrifice for the sake of Germany. Behind Jähn lies the might of the NVA, the SED, the Stasi, and every instrument at the DDR's disposal - instruments which he has displayed no fear to use.

Unlike the decadence of the old West, the DDR will champion traditional German virtues – discipline, diligence, and collective responsibility – while fiercely resisting the corrosive influence of foreign ideologies and moral relativism. This ‘Modern Kulturkampf’ will see the SED actively promote socialist realism in the arts, defend traditional family structures, and combat what it deems the excesses of liberal individualism, all in the name of strengthening national unity and preserving the socialist character of the German nation."

Under the guidance of the Premier, we shall strive to make sure that no German is a stranger, and the inalienable rights of all are recognized under the law of the German Democratic Republic.

Under the guise of Premier [GER.GetLeader], we have finally begun living up to the lofty image we have projected for ourselves.

Unfortunately, the National Front is as much of a sham now as it was the day it was dissolved.

For too long, Dictators like Ulbricht and Honecker have been hailed as 'Great Statesmen', but if we are truly to embrace our identity as the German 'Democratic' Republic, then we must look to the only one of the SED's founders willing to speak up against the injustices committed in their name.

The mutual agreements held between Modrow and Gysi have made room within the Gysi administration for loyalists to the former regime of Hans Modrow. While they may be opposed to some of the most ambitious tenets of our reform agenda, including Modrowites within our tent is just common sense.

The SED as people once knew it is gone, the Hardliners and Despots forced to reckon with their crimes and betrayal of the German People. In its place, the new SED rises as a party committed to Democratic Socialism. Our fight against Capitalism is as great as our fight against Autocracy, a fight we shall shoulder to the end. And while the 'Leading role of the party' has ensured the SED's continued electoral success, Gysi's ambitious reforms have ensured that for the first time in the DDR's history, the country’s elections aren’t a complete sham."

 GER_return_to_moscow_line_desc:0 "As much as we don't like to admit it, Gysi's pitiful attempts at 'Reform' have decidedly driven the cause of the Progressive faction into the ground. Continued disloyalty to the line of Moscow has been the last straw for Premier Schröder, who instead of standing by his longtime allies in the 68er wing of the SED such as Olaf Scholz, has banked on the support of hardliners such as Egon Krenz, who have previously fallen out of favour thanks to Gysi's efforts.

While cosmopolitanism abounds in the concrete halls of urban decline, our Landvolk put in a day's worth of honest toil in God's Country, providing sustenance for us all in what seems to be the most thankless job of them all. Thankfully, they have the DBD there to advocate for them."

And thankfully, under the new government of parties such as the DBD and LDPD., Germans finally have. The torch of Personal Liberty has been held aloft in Germany, allowing a government to come to power which focuses on the health and wellbeing of their citizenry. People should not live in fear of their Governments, Governments should live in fear of their people."

Nations such as Canada and Korea have already experimented with the legalization of marijuana, to fantastic results. The time has come to re-orient ourselves from the 'Drogenkrieg' era and formally legalize Cannabis within Germany. Now that we can safely move away from our Opioidkrise area policies on marijuana, we can gain new economic opportunities in the pot business, as well as extra taxable income from marijuana sales."

The time has come to put an end to the work of the Treuhandanstalt, and create a new holding agency for the remaining Government-owned property.

The LDPD has carved out its own niche in the realm of German Politics, promising a smaller government and advocating for Social Liberalism. At the heart of their campaign is a promise, an oath to the German people, a solemn vow to not let Germany's third and perhaps final shot at Democracy go to waste. Beyond all, the LDPD shall stand for Democracy, and work tirelessly to ensure that the Government shall never be able to menace its citizens again."

As we embark on the transformation to a truly free market, we shall begin the reduction of bureaucratic red tape, the encouragement of new business ventures, and the fostering of international trade relations.

Liberalism, once written off as a dead force in European politics, has returned to the spotlight with a blaze of glory. In Germany, the spirit of Romantic Nationalism is alive and well, yet so many Europeans still languish under the rigors of oppression. The dream of a united, liberal Europe has suffered grave setbacks, yet the LDPD refuses to let it die - and we trust that one day, the soft glow of Liberty's torch shall shine across Europe once more in triumph."

While they claim to be the heirs of the old Social Democratic Legacy, the new SPD is in fact a new party all together, combining the fury of dissident intellectuals and protestant theologians.

While some Secularists denounce our new course, we maintain faith in our lord as a foundational part of the Social Democrat movement, ensuring that Germany will be defined by a vision of social democracy rooted in Christian ethics, solidarity, and community."

Yet when things seemed their darkest, the SPD prevailed, pulling itself from the brink of decimation and once more establishing itself as a legitimate force once more.

 GER_form_socialist_militias_desc:0 "The fall of Communism led to the formal illegalization of Political Uniforms and Paramilitaries within Germany. However the SED, in order to bolster the dominance of their party while providing another additional arm of security to the republic, has moved to strike down these restrictions, integrate Red Militants as the official militant arm of the party. This shall allow us to by-pass the restrictions calling for an apolitical armed forces, while giving our party a loyal defense force - a necessary act in many of our ministers’ eyes given the reactionary tendencies and conservative sympathies of our armed forces."

If our party is to remain competitive, we must ensure our ability to exert political influence on both sides of the former Iron Curtain. While it's a tough sell given the long history of human rights abuses under Communism, with enough elbow grease and sweet nothings whispered into Wessi ears, we can ensure continued electoral victory, backed by Germans from across our great nation."

While the BfV has warned us against the influence of this faction, the continued electoral success of the NDPD has made any action on their part impossible.

Regardless of what they call it, most experts agree that the SOME is a perfect middle-ground between Free-Market Capitalism and Welfarism.

Markus Söder, the first Chairma of the Council of Ministers in Bavaria following Restoration, has emerged as a voice for both Monarchism and Southern Interests. Known for his extravagant Royal uniforms, lofty Royal titles awarded to him by Franz von Bayern and the Kaiser himself, and his well-renowned love for all things Bavaria, including his homeland's powerful penchant for religiosity, Markus Söder has upheld the legacy of such great Bavarian leaders such as Ruprecht, Ludwig II and the Regent Luitpold."

While some have cautioned us away from abolishing a system which has kept the Socialist Dogs at bay in Germany's most important Constituent Kingdom, the fact remains that the Prussian voting system is so brazenly unpopular that any Party which takes credit for abolishing it would easily dominate Prussia's elections for the next 20 to 30 years."

To fight off the assaults from the Left and Liberals, we must uphold these certain 'undemocratic' practices - and only grovel in the form of replacing the confusing 'Tiers' with a 'Plural Vote', a system in which each citizen starts with one vote, but can get up to eight votes through fulfilling certain wealth and education qualifications.

This shall both provide the illusion of Democracy, and allow the legal German political scene to be dominated by Conservative and pro-Monarchy voices.

The heavily-Catholic population of Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg has not taken kindly to the anti-Religious bent of the SED. However by easing up our policies against the Catholic Church, channeling the spirits of Catholic Socialist trailblazers such as Vitus Heller, and encouraging Socialistic interpretations of Church teaching, we can begin to whittle away at the discontent felt by Southern Germany."

 GER_co_opt_bavarian_culture_desc:0 "The rigid Prussian traditions of East Germany have caused quite the rift with the South since reunification - with the culture of the region being labled as 'boorish' and 'backwater' by SED functionaries in Berlin. In the years since Austria's mostly-consentual unification with Germany, it has become clear that this patronising attitude towards those south of the Weißwurstäquator was mistake. Let us indulge in Bavarian festivities, even sending Premier [GER.GetLeader] to Munich to enjoy some Bratwürste, Prezels and a stein of freshly-poured beer."

 GER_stamp_out_southern_seperatism_desc:0 "The long standing Austrian Separatist movement has begun steadily infecting political discourse in Süddeutschland. While at first it was predicted that Austrian integration would stem feelings that Bavaria had more in common with their Catholic Brothers in Austria, the annexation of Austria has instead thrust the concept of breaking off Southern Germany and Austria into a seperate nation into the mainstream. We must crush these strains of thought before they gain footing and threaten the concept of German Nationhood we have fought so hard to make a reality."

Switzerland, a false 'nation' that in the years since Capitalism's fall has been nothing but a pitiful bunker for Europe's former rich and powerful, has fallen in the sights of the Volksarmee. With relations between the Warsaw Pact and Switzerland remaining abysmal, and with France and Italy eager to claim their own native sectors of the false 'Swiss' nation, many are cheering on a final conflict to wipe this pimple off the face of Europe.

In the modern era, the European Union of Socialist Republics has fulfilled this role as the organization bringing together those in Red Europe for a common cause. However with our successes in uniting the European Continent, skepticism towards the EUSR remains strong. The abolition of the EU in 1988 saw all non-Communist nations leave the organization - with the Eastern Bloc nations which joined shortly after sharing a great deal of distrust for this organization.

 GER_norwegian_membership_desc:0 "Norway has been under the rule of a Revolutionary Communist Government ever since the late 1980's - however despite their similar government, the increasingly repressive and at times insane rule of Øystein Meier Johannessen has seriously damaged the Nordic Nation's international standing.

Menaced by the USSR at every turn, Finnish leadership under Juha-Pekka Väisänen has denounced the EUSR as nothing more than a bloc to legitimize Moscow's tyrannical vision of Communism, instead embracing their own model of semi-Democratic Socialism. However as we have moved away from Soviet influence, perhaps the Finns can be swayed?"

 rw_germany.1.t:0 "Risen from the Ruin"
 rw_germany.1.d:0 "The German People have not always had it easy. Two devastating World Wars, half a decade of occupation followed by nearly half a century of division. In some ways, the German people have shed their legacy of hardship. In other ways they have not. 1987 saw the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the unification of East and West Germany under the Communist East. In the years since our nation has been graced with untold prosperity; the DDR becoming the de-facto leader of Europe, second only to the Soviet Union. The leading economy in Europe, Germany has come to dominate the European Union of Socialist Republics, the successor to the former European Union. This situation has led some to theorize that the DDR may be on track to usurp the Soviet Union as hegemon of Europe; even if such talk is frowned upon in Berlin's halls of power. However not all is sunshine and rainbows in Germany. While the wall may have been torn down, deep scars still divide our nation between East and West. These divides, combined with a lack of focus on the Government in the West, has led to a prevailing sense of 'Westalgie' among denizens of the former Federal Republic of Germany."
 rw_germany.1.o1:0 "Über Deutschland scheint!\nÜber Deutschland scheint!"
 
 rw_germany.2.t:0 "The National Disease"
 rw_germany.2.d:0 "The loss of Freedom, Democracy and National Identity, and Industry has impacted the West in countless ways. The Soviet Union, our benefactor, refused to cosign our unification unless we instituted a massive program of deindustrialization in West Germany, leading to an explosion of unemployment among a nation ill-equipped to handle it, having next to none prior to 1987. While increased resistance and anger towards the Government are common manifestations were to be expected, one more subtle sign of disease have become commonplace in the West. An explosion in drug use has been reported by the Volkspolizei; even if the government has refused to acknowledge the crisis, mostly out of fear that such a bitter truth would shatter their delusions of Germany being a Socialist paradise. Nonetheless, the crisis has become a serious problem - unproductive labour sucking the soul out of our 'Workers Paradise', all while strung out junkies harass the fine Volk of Germany on the street. While this outbreak was originally contained to the West, within both halves of our nation, a rapid uptick in deaths, petty crime, illegal operations and general social dysfunction has been reported, putting serious strain on both the societal cohesion of our nation and our law enforcement apparatus. These drugs appear to be flowing in from both domestic and foreign sources, with Afghanistan and the former United States being pointed out as sources. The Stasi, ever concerned with rooting out resistance activity, have not made tackling this crisis a priority. However as this crisis continues to strain our resources, Premier Modrow has been pressured to take action; even if such would shine an ugly light on the 'Socialist Paradise' we have created here in Germany."

 rw_germany.3.t:0 "Our Party's Sword and Shield"
 rw_germany.3.d:0 "The Stasi remains as perhaps the most feared and respected institution in the entirety of the German Democratic Republic. The SED's ruthless Secret Police and Intelligence Agency, the Stasi has been pulling a double-shift, terrorizing German denizens and keeping our nation safe from insurgents since its foundation in 1950. Officially called the Ministerium für Staatssicherheit, the Stasi, and its foreign intelligence wing, the Main Directorate for Reconnaissance, has gradually gained a truly stunning reputation as the world's most formidable intelligence agency. Long surpassing Mi6, CSIS, the KGB and the dilapidated CIA, the Stasi's ruthless efficiency both at home and abroad is something to behold, even for their enemies.\n\nTo the German Citizenry in both the East and West, the Stasi stands as the unseen instrument of control looming over much of their daily lives. Indeed, the mere word 'Stasi' is enough to send chills down the spine of any German. Reaching the height of their power during the regime of Markus Wolf, the Stasi remains a chilling reminder to those in the West that the era of political and social freedom in the West is long since over; and the promises of 'Democratic Socialism' promised during the Reunification Referendum are a long way from the bitter reality that is. While to us in the SED, the Stasi is the cold, heartless, and merciless force responsible for the virtual wipeout of insurgents and radicals in the wake of Reunification. They know their job, and as it seems, they're damn good at it."

 rw_germany.4.d:0 "West Germany was not the only sovereign nation which found itself folded in with East Germany during the latter half of the 20th Century - Austria, Germany's longtime neighbor and ally which was previously integrated into Germany during the Anschluss of 1938, narrowly voted to join the DDR after their nation's Communist Party was swept into power. While this course of action was heavily frowned upon by the Soviet Union, it appeared there was little Moscow could do to stop Austria's Annexation; as German reunification strengthened the DDR to a point where they no longer had to take marching orders from the USSR. The annexation of Austria remains a point of contention between Berlin and Moscow... However, as it seems, Germany is no longer a satellite state of Moscow, and is in a position to call its own shots. The blatant defiance of the DDR set off alarm bells in Moscow, as many a Politburo member cursed Lenin's name that they let the Germans re-unify. The strategy of keeping Germany weak had failed, and for the first time in their history, it seemed that the Soviet Union had faced a serious challenge to their power in Europe; even if they'd never admit it. Meanwhile, Austria remains as a hotbed of resistance activity, with the Stasi working around the clock to keep the state from active rebellion. While most resistance and pro-Independence movements have been padded down during the regime of Markus Wolf, there is a general sense that any day now, the Austrian powderkeg could spark to light; perhaps even triggering violence and separatist feelings in our southern areas as well..."

While doctors attempted to revive Yazov, they were unable to, and the Premier was pronounced dead shortly after.\nAlready funeral preparations are being made, as Communist leaders from across the world move to pay their respects to the late Comrade Yazov. However some here in the DDR have a far more cynical reaction to Yazov's assassination; after all, his death may very well begin opening up the cracks in the Soviet Union's foundation, allowing Germany to extend its influence in Europe. The fact that Yazov's assassination would begin a bitter factional divide which could very well tear the USSR apart is well known, with some already pointing fingers to foreign intelligence agencies. Of course, the only one which has the skill and fortitude to pull of such an operation would be Germany's own Stasi...\n\nAlthough there are some reports of a covert plan targeting Soviet leadership, there appears to be no sign that the Stasi is responsible Yazov's death, even if we had the capabilities to do so, and even if his death is greatly to our nation's benefit."

 rw_germany.6.d:0 "After years of silence, it appears the dam has finally burst. Progressive members of the SED have taken to the pulpit in a bold challenge to existing narcotics laws. A formal plan to reform the Narcotics law and begin a comprehensive strategy to address the crisis has now been proposed by many 'Progressive' members of the SED. While this motion to address the epidemic is popular with much of the SED, beginning a concrete course of action would effectively acknowledge the problem, letting both the country and the world know of its true extent, meaning that things would have to get worse before getting better. With bitter factionalism enveloping the SED, any sign of weakness may be just the signal our enemies need to depose Premier Modrow; however continuing to ignore the crisis may put Modrow's Premiership in even more jeopardy. Indeed, it seems that the response to the 'Opioidkrise' may make or break Modrow's hold on power, and even the slightest misstep may drastically change the makeup of SED leadership going into the 16th Congress."

 rw_germany.7.d:0 "Progressive members of the SED were met with disappointment today after Premier Hans Modrow officially vetoed a motion to begin a comprehensive reform of Germany's drug policies. However what was once disappointment has quickly given way to fury, as Progressive members of the SED have loudly begun to voice their discontent... at least as much is permitted within the ranks of the infamously authoritarian SED. The collapse of Modrow's support within the Progressive faction has also emboldened the hardliners, with Egon Krenz, de-facto leader of the faction, loudly touting Modrow's failures. Worse yet, it appears that Progressives and Hardliners may even be working together to bring down Modrow, which if true, is nothing short of a nightmare scenario for the current Premier. Of course, some within Modrow's circle have encouraged him to reach out to the Progressives and accept their narcotics legislation; if only to hold off the Hardliners for another moment."

 rw_germany.8.d:0 "It seems that Modrow's nightmare scenario has come to pass. The Hardliners and Progressive factions of the SED have seemingly banded together in an effort to craft comprehensive policy on the Opioidkrise. Krenz, while infamously defensive of the 'Socialist Paradise' we call home, has seemingly broken ranks by acknowledging the existence of the crisis, even going so far as to blame Modrow for continued failures on narcotics policy. The unity of Progressive and Hardliner factions in the wake of Modrow's dismissal of the Narcotics bills has rang alarm bells within Modrow's inner circle. It appears clear to those versed in the inner halls of power within the DDR that the leadership of Hans Modrow is not long for this world. Such unity among diametrically opposed factions is nothing short of a disaster for the embattled Premier and his loyalists, and could very well lead to a repeat of the events of 1990 which saw Premier Honecker forced out of power; albeit for drastically different reasons. However, while failure on the narcotics issue has driven the Progressives away from Modrow, a substantial rift still exits between them and the Hardliners; one which we could possibly exploit if we meet the Progressive's demands."

 rw_germany.9.t:0 "Anti-Modrow Conspiracies Materialize"
 rw_germany.9.d:0 "After growing impatient with constant inaction by Premier Modrow, it appears that party insiders have moved to overthrow Premier Hans Modrow. With Modrow running on borrowed time as Premier of the DDR, countless members of the inner party have begun jockeying to be Modrow's successor once the embattled Premier is inevitably deposed. While countless influential figures have thrown their hat into the right, one man stands as the most likely to succeed the Premier: the hardliner Egon Krenz. Krenz, who previously served as General Secretary during the rule of Markus Wolf, would undeniably be a step backwards for many within the Progressive faction, leading some, especially Gregor Gysi, to propose negotiation with Premier Modrow. Desperate for a lifeline, it is highly likely that Modrow would accept their progressive Narcotics reform policy in exchange for stopping Krenz's hardliner clique from seizing power. Modrow, while a proud man, is not a stupid man, and would be likely to support the progressive policies... if only as a way to save his own skin. However, to many, it simply seems to be too late to stop the machinations of the SED against Modrow now..."

 rw_germany.10.t:0 "Krenz Topples Modrow"
 rw_germany.10.d:0 "The conspiracies which have been at work against Premier Hans Modrow have finally borne fruit. After holding an internal vote, senior members of the SED have formally removed Hans Modrow from his position as Premier of the German Democratic Republic. Succeeding him as Premier is former General Secretary Egon Krenz, who has been elected by an internal vote of SED members. Taking the stage during his first stage, Krenz promised to undo much of the moderate policies of the Modrow regime, while working to blunt some of the harsher edges of the Honecker and Wolf regimes, even going so far as to promise further liberalization and democratic reforms. However as it stands, few in SED believe Krenz's lofty promises, writing off his speech as nothing more than vapid promises to the Progressive members of the SED. Although Progressives and Modrow-era officials are outraged over Krenz's ascension, it seems that there is truly nothing they can do to dislodge him."
 rw_germany.10.o1:0 "Long Live the new Premier!"
   
 rw_germany.11.t:0 "Modrow Grovels to Reformists"
 rw_germany.11.d:0 "In a desperate effort to save his own skin, Premier Hans Modrow has agreed with the Progressive proposal to reform Germany's narcotics law and begin addressing the Opioid Crisis. While Modrow previously vetoed the bill to avoid acknowledging the true depths of the crisis, after nearly half a decade of enduring the 'Opioidkrise', the Narcotics bill has become a make-or-break moment for the embattled Premier, and has forced him to compromise in an effort to save his own Premiership. With the new Narcotics law taking effect shortly, Progressive members of the SED have once more fell in line, supporting Modrow either out of loyalty or out of an effort to prevent Hardliners from seizing power in Modrow's moment of weakness. While the morale of Modrow loyalists has been badly damaged by the events of the last few days, it seems that the worst is over, and those in the SED can finally return to some sense of calm."
 rw_germany.11.o1:0 "Better them than Krenz..."
    
 rw_germany.12.t:0 "Krenz Addresses the Volkskammer"
 rw_germany.12.d:0 "For the first time since the shocking fall of Premier Hans Modrow, incoming Premier Krenz has formally addressed the Volkskammer, the highest organ of state power and official lawmaking body of the German Democratic Republic. Despite acting as mainly a rubber stamp for the SED's agenda, the Volkskammer still serves an important role in keeping the influence of different groups the infamously factionalist Socialist Einheitspartei in check. During his first address, Krenz has announced his plans for the creation of an Opioid Task Force, further stating that the problem of drug use shall be rooted out entirely. As well, Krenz assigned blame to the outgoing Premier Modrow for letting the crisis deteriorate. In his final words, Krenz promised to restore the pride and prestige of Germany in the future, and fulfill the vision of our nation as a true Socialist Paradise."
 rw_germany.12.o1:0 "Do we have better things to do than assign blame?"
 
 rw_germany.14.t:0 "The SED Declares a 'War on Drugs'"
 rw_germany.14.d:0 "With the SED finally reckoning with the true depth of the given 'Opioidkrise', hardliners within the party have opted to embark on an operation to root out every trace of drug use within our great Arbeiter und Bauernstaat. The 'Drogenkrieg', or 'War on Drugs', is an extensive strategy meant to erase any trace of drug use from the streets of Germany, defying the will of Progressives who have supported a more pragmatic approach to the Opioid Crisis. Drug Users, Drug Dealers, and all those in between shall face the full fury of the German Government, with the VoPo and the Volkskammer being fully integrated into this extensive operation. While those peddling so-called 'Harm Reduction' strategies have expressed outrage, we are confident that our efforts to eradicate the junkie scum shall show positive results in due time."
 rw_germany.14.o1:0 "And we thank the mastermind behind the operation: Sigmund Jähn!"
  
 rw_germany.15.t:0 "Stasi Brought into Drug Operations"
 rw_germany.15.d:0 "The Stasi, through decades of faithful service to the German people, has gained a reputation as perhaps the most feared and respected institution in Germany. While they have thus far steered clear of intervention in the Opioidkrise, under the guide of General Secretary Sigmund Jähn, the Stasi has been brought in to help clear out junkie scum and stem the domestic supply of narcotics. The comprehensive operation designed to root out drug use in its entirety is mind boggling in scale, with the Stasi's extensive military and political reach being brought out in full force in an effort to end the Opioid Crisis. Of course, while the Stasi's main priority is clearing out those caught up in the narcotics trade, if a few particularly persistent dissidents and opposition figures also happened to be caught up in this undertaking, who would be the wiser?"
 rw_germany.15.o1:0 "We shall target the Narcotics supply - Root and Stem!"
   
 rw_germany.16.t:0 "Militarization of the Volkspolizei"
 rw_germany.16.d:0 "Serving as our primary 'Legitimate' police agency, the Volkspolizei, better known as the 'VoPo', have been tasked with civilian law enforcement, and have served as the main government instrument of the SED throughout the prolonged 'Opioidkrise'. While their duties and operations have seemed limited compared to their much more powerful counterparts, the Stasi, the VoPo still provide important services both to the party and to the SED, and have been instrumental in overseeing government efforts to deal with the Opioid Crisis. As Drug dealers and users become increasingly dangerous and increasingly well armed, the VoPo has been given additional training and equipment, as well as additional authority to search and detain German citizens accused of drug possession. This new direction, while popular with the hardliners, has no shortage of detractors, especially in the Stasi, who see this increasing militarization as encroaching on their own base of power."
 rw_germany.16.o1:0 "Do we really need a second Stasi?"
    
 rw_germany.17.t:0 "Sigmund Jähn Declares Victory in the War on Drugs"
 rw_germany.17.d:0 "After a debilitating campaign of 'Totaler Krieg' against the Narcotics epidemic, it seems that our efforts have finally borne fruit. The junkies are off the junk, the drug dealers are in prisons, and the domestic narcotics supply has been wiped out. For the first time in years, it seems that the prevailing issue of drug use has finally begun to subside. Taking credit for these marvelous developments is none other than General Secretary Sigmund Jähn, a popular former Air Force general who has been a familiar face in the SED ever since the regime of Markus Wolf. While a popular figure often compared to the 'Grandfather' of the German nation, it seems that Jähn has an agenda of his own, and seeks to implement his own highly-paternal form of Socialism. With Jähn's schemes coming to fruition, it seems increasingly likely that the SED will throw out Premier Krenz in favor of Jähn during their next Congress."
 rw_germany.17.o1:0 "Krenz may very well be running on borrowed time..."
 
 rw_germany.18.t:0 "Bread and Circuses"
 rw_germany.18.d:0 "It is no secret that the sudden fall of Premier Modrow due to the Opioidkrise has rattled the German populace deeply. From diehard Stalinists to dyed-in-the-wool Reformites, to members of the Democratic or Far-Right underground, everyone seems to have their own opinion on what these recent developments mean for Germany. For Egon Krenz, the rapid change in leadership has forced the SED to confront several of the ugly unspoken truths within our great Socialist paradise, and has unquestionably shown weakness both to our rivals on the international stage and to unsavory elements within our nation. Desperate to distract the people from the going-on's of the inner Party, Premier Krenz has announced a package of new reforms and programs. Tax cuts, the loosening of Media restrictions and a nationwide price cut on food and alcohol are now the focus of an ever-talkative citizenry, who have already begun to forget the development of the last few weeks. Whether Krenz will succeed in distracting the public from the affairs of their government during this trying time will remain to be seen, however for now, it seems that the public's attention remains elsewhere."

 rw_germany.19.t:0 "Junkies Rounded Up"
 rw_germany.19.d:0 "The explosion in unemployment and homelessness in the Western half of the country has not gone unnoticed by either the SED or our many enemies. Across the world, anti-Communist media and figures have dragged the good name of Germany through the mud, denouncing our 'Socialist Paradise' as nothing more than a sham and stating that the massive homelessness and drug crisis facing our nation is a direct result of Communist rule. Desperate to maintain the veneer of prosperity and happiness, the Krenz administration has attempted to address these concerns, to mixed results. While solid progress is being made to tackle the drug crisis, the problem of drug-addled lowlives prowling our streets still remains apparent. In a nationwide effort to keep our cities safe, members of the VoPo and Stasi have taken party in an extensive campaign to get the junkie scum off our streets, relocating them to safe and out-of-the-way 'Rehabilitation Centers' far from the public eye. Of course, this operation is far from without controversy, as countless officials have decried the 'inhumane' conditions in these centers and the violation of the rights of those abducted during the raids. Regardless, this program has seemed successful in cleaning up both the streets of Germany and our government's public image."
 rw_germany.19.o1:0 "See no evil."
   
 rw_germany.20.t:0 "Krenz Declares Return to Normalcy"
 rw_germany.20.d:0 "Across Germany, members of the SED have hailed the end of the so-called 'Opioidkrise' and the return of normalcy to the streets and neighborhoods of our great Arbeiter und Bauernstaat. Special attention has been paid to Premier Krenz, who has snatched most of the credit for ending Germany's drug crisis. Unfortunately, while the SED has proclaimed the Opioid Crisis to be at an end, many have raised suspicion that the government is celebrating prematurely. Indeed, the scourge of drug addiction still remains prevalent; even if it is nowhere near the levels of less than a year ago. To many both within the SED and within underground political movements, an unspoken understanding exists that Krenz has proclaimed victory against Opioid use publicly as a mean to improve his own popularity, sure up his support in anticipation of the 16th Congress of the SED and hopefully let the population believe that the Drug Crisis has truly ended and life in Germany can go back to normal. Regardless of if the crisis is truly over, it seems that most Germans are content in the SED's conclusion that the crisis has been addressed in a satisfactory method, and that the 'Opioidkrise' is no longer a pressing issue."

Egon Krenz, who was recently brought to power in such a backroom agreement, is far from secure in his position. The fall of Modrow has propelled a new generation of scheming officials to the top, and a return to several Wolf-era policies has ignited an appetite for change among the German Populace. Indeed, inner rumblings within the cabinet have threatened to bring Krenz's rule to an end before it can truly begin. The aging former General Secretary and now Premier has quietly expressed a desire to retire, paving the way for a different candidate to be elected during the next Party Congress. Whether these rumours have any truth to them can only be known when the Congress assembles in April. Such events, held every five years, typically serve as little more than rubber stamps for the current Premier's agenda.

In a speech heavy in emotion, Premier Modrow has addressed members of the Volkskammer, admitting a tactical level of failure within Germany's narcotics policy and admitting that our Opioid situation is indeed a crisis. This address, while celebrated by Progressive members, has seemingly rubbed Hardliners the wrong way, as many, including Egon Krenz, accuse Modrow and Gysi of blowing the situation out of proportion, and damaging the delicate image of German Socialism on the world stage by admitting that our nation is not as prosperous as it once seemed.

One such departure is current General Secretary Sigmund Jähn, a popular former NVA officer and pilot who ascended to the position during the tenure of Markus Wolf. Jähn, while having a reputation as an unrepentant Stalinist and ally of the late Premier Wolf, is also a beloved figure within Germany due to his approachable, warm and grandfatherly visage, and will certainly be missed by many both within the SED and the German Public. With the position of General Secretary now vacant, Premier Modrow has been tasked with finding his replacement. Jähn, who acted as a counterbalance to the more Reformist Modrow, is most likely to be replaced by another Hardliner as a means of ensuring political balance. The leading candidate is Angela Merkel, the current Minister of Research and Technology, an obscure and seemingly non-ambitious figure who is unlikely to outshine the Premier in any meaningful capacity. However Modrow, ever distrustful of the hardline faction, may also break this German Political norm, and appoint the reformist Chairman of the State Counci, Gregor Gysi as General Secretary as a way to diminish the power of Conservatives within the SED.

Premier Modrow, finally forced to reckon with the true depths of the crisis, has finally decided to follow the lead of several Progressive SED members, and implement a program of rehabilitation and harm reduction to help combat the Opioidkrise. While several hardline members have lambasted such concessions to 'Junkie Scum' and have called for a harsh response spearheaded by the VoPo and the Stasi, Premier Modrow along with his progressive allies are confident that the Swiss-style treatment model shall adequately help drug-addicted Germans recover from their vices and go on to live prosperous lives as valuable members of Socialist society.

In addition to a massive information campaign spearheaded by the party, anti-drug messaging has become mandatory for all civilian programing within Germany, with every scripted television show currently on air required to contain at least one episode where drug use is portrayed negatively.

A massive programme of deindustrialization, spearheaded by the Soviet Union cost countless 'Wessis' their jobs and livelihoods, and made the already grim situation in the West far worse. Almost 20 years after reunification, it seems that these problems still very much plague West Germany, with deindustrialization being cited as the primary reason for the present unemployment crisis. To help remedy this, the SED has begun a comprehensive project of public works and infrastructure projects, hoping to reduce unemployment in the former Federal Republic and giving 'Wessis' some much-needed opportunity in life.

For the first time since the Premier publicly acknowledged the crisis, a formal address has been made to the inner party, informing them of the progress in remedying the Opioid Crisis. In strict defiance of hardliner predictions, it seems that Modrow's moderate approach to the addiction crisis is beginning to bear fruit, leaving many of those calling the Premier weak looking quite foolish. For Modrow, the numbers show a bout of good news, as empirical data shows our situation improving.

Established during the Cold War era in East Germany, these non-combatant conscripts, known as "Bausoldaten," historically served as an alternative for conscientious objectors, performing essential infrastructure work while abstaining from bearing arms. Though the reunified German state preserved this tradition within its Nationale Volksarmee, the question of their continued autonomy has sparked heated discussion. Some argue that their separate status remains a valuable concession to those who oppose direct military service, maintaining a channel for public service that aligns with personal convictions, while still contributing meaningfully to the nation’s preparedness.\n\nConversely, proponents of integration argue that a unified force, free from distinctions between combatant and construction roles, would foster greater cohesion and operational efficiency. With global conflicts increasingly demanding versatile and mobile military capabilities, the Nationale Volksarmee’s resources are stretched thin, and integrating construction soldiers into the main force could address personnel shortages while streamlining logistical operations. Critics of this approach, however, warn that such a move risks eroding the principled stance on conscientious objection that Germany has long upheld.

Erich Honecker, plagued by illness, was pressured to abdicate much of his authority, leaving him with only the symbolic title of Premier. Egon Krenz was hailed as Honecker's successor, however fate seemed to have different plans for him. Markus Wolf would be named as Premier after Honecker's death, and would begin gradually shifting true power within the SED from General Secretary to Premier. Krenz, despite once being hailed as Honecker's successor, was in no position to stop him. Krenz would find himself isolated within the SED, eventually replaced as General Secretary by Sigmund Jähn. Years later, Wolf's legacy has faded away slowly - yet Krenz prevails, now inhabiting the office of his former rival. There is much to say about Wolf. Indeed, Krenz has a certain amount of respect for all which was accomplished under his rule. Indeed, the sacrifices made during his rule helped keep Germany stable in the wake of a tumultuous reunification. It has been the policy of the Krenz administration not to speak ill of the dead, and while for Krenz there is a certain amount of closure for his failures in the General Secretariat now that he has risen as Premier, it is the way of the German people not to gloat, but to rather acknowledge quietly triumph. Markus Wolf was not perfect, but he kept Germany safe, and from now on, this shall be the official line of the SED.

Though Jähn remains the public face of the regime, it is clear that he increasingly relies on the General Secretary for guidance, deferring to her judgment on even minor matters. Among observers at home and abroad, speculation runs wild that that Jähn is, in effect, a puppet of the Purple Witch, a pliable instrument for her long-held vision of a rigidly controlled and ideologically pure DDR. The whispers within the SED are clear: Jähn may wear the crown, but Margot Honecker truly wields the scepter."

While the relationship has historically been symbiotic, with Soviet raw materials exchanged for German manufactured goods, recent tensions, especially following Austria's annexation, have cast shadows over this arrangement. Moscow has already hinted at 'supply adjustments' during diplomatic spats, a thinly-veiled threat that has sent tremors through Berlin's economic planning committees. With this in mind, Premier [GER.GetLeader] has quietly ordered contingency plans to be drawn up, including expanded storage facilities and tentative outreach to alternative suppliers, but the harsh reality remains: any significant disruption to Soviet oil would bring our industrial heartland to its knees within weeks."

To some, that's all you need to know about the now-most powerful woman in the world. One among many iron-fisted rulers of the German nation. However to countless Germans, within the echelons of power within the SED and outside, Wagenknecht's rise to power is far more intriguing than the story weaved by the outgoing Premier. Starting as a FDJ member and Staunch Stalinist, Wagenknecht officially became a member of the Volkskammer in the late 90's, gradually cementing herself as a formidable voice within the SED. Avoiding the purges of Markus Wolf, Wagenknecht emerged as a sharp critic of Modrow's 'Spineless Moderation', and cemented herself as a member of the SED's Hardliner faction. When Modrow fell from power, Wagenknecht emerged as the de-facto Second-in-Command to Egon Krenz, standing into the spotlight after the 'unofficial' resignation of Sigmund Jähn. Egon Krenz, himself a member of the DRR's Old Guard, found himself pressured to step aside to make way for younger, more energetic leadership. With both him and Jähn taking a well-earned retirement, Wagenknecht emerged as a logical successor. Now Germany's paramount leader, Wagenknecht has promised to bring a slough of controversial policies to the table. While her staunch Stalinism has reassured the party core, her ideas on Economic Liberalization and German Nationalism have some within the party - however others, including the famously hard-to-please Progressives, seem to be warming up to the SED's radical changes in policy."

Indeed, not even the Bloc Parties exist to raise concern with our policies. The SED's refusal to change is best exemplified by Egon Krenz, perhaps the very personification of the Old Guard, who has finally taken his leave. From the ashes of the Old Guard rises Sahra Wagenknecht, a paragon of Modern Stalinism, far removed from the veritable skeletons which once presided over our nation. While we wish no will to the retiring titans such as Jähn and Krenz, under Wagenknecht, the SED shall no longer be dominated by the Old Guard, freeing up our nation to move unbridled into modernity.

These reforms will allow for worker-owned cooperatives to operate with greater autonomy and compete in certain sectors. The Premier has emphasized that these changes represent an evolution of socialist principles rather than an abandonment - with her undying commitments to Communist principles pointing to that undeniably.

Be it from the barbaric hordes spilling over the Mediterranean, to the horrid resurgence of Westernism and 'Liberal Philosophy', even by those within the Soviet Union. This attack on our values can no longer be tolerated.

While attempting to push through comprehensive reform to our intelligence agency beforehand would have been a death sentence, Wagenknecht's power is entrenched to a point where she can finally tackle the issue without backlash from the Old Guard.

As Reagan rubbed shoulders with tyrants in the Middle East, Africa and Central America, the whole world realized how hollow the American concept of 'Freedom' truly was. Now, in the 20 years since the wicked USA's fall, it seems that 'Freedom' has taken on a new meaning. In Germany, true freedom is the freedom to be free, the freedom from the oppression of Capitalism, breathing free in the Liberty of Socialism. While our governments and economic systems have changed, it seems that all within Germany have come to realize that true Freedom comes not from one's representatives or system of governance, but from an inalienable respect for Human Rights and Dignity.

The stain of Nazism is confined to the Capitalist West, a nation built off the same Capitalistic exploitation which built Nazi Germany, and the same Wehrmacht officers who built the foundations of the Bonn Republic's Bundeswehr.

Of course, true legitimacy within the DDR's political system still lies with Premier [GER.GetLeader].

Of course, the dissolution of the ZDF and ARD never stopped the scourge of unpermitted broadcasting.

Those yearning for peace were just as shocked as those eager to start killing their neighbors. Gysi raised no fuss, attempted no underhanded moves to stay in power, as is common with Communist Regimes on their last legs. With cardboard boxes in their hands, SED functionaries departed from their offices and Government buildings, knowing that their fight was yesterday's fight, a fight which has already been lost. Already a committee to draft a new Constitution has been assembled. A provisional document is already in force, removing every trace of Communist language. Every section mentioning the SED was trimmed from Germany's founding documents word by word. When they were done with their revisions, the SED was nothing more than another failed political party.

The party of Communist tyranny pathetically attempted to endear themselves to the populace which they spent so long crushing via Jackboot, and acted stunned that they rightfully cast them out of Germany's halls of power. Working within the system provided, we defeated the Tyrants. Yet there is still much work to be done. The framework of the German Democratic Republic is one of a Communist State - a framework which no longer applies to our newly-Democratic government. We must begin pulling out the remnants of Communist Governance, root and stem. Already citizens and Government Officials have begun the practice of cutting the emblems out of the German flag, running the untainted Red, Black and Gold tricolor up the flagpoles in a final act of symbolic defiance against the Communist regime.

With the 17th Congress of the Sozialistische Einheitspartei fast approaching, Gysi has once more found himself in hot water with his party. Indeed, even though Gysi has been met with success in forcing out the most radical of the Hardliner faction, entrenched figures within the Party have continued to voice opposition to Gysi's policies. Despite the fact that SED Party Congresses are typically formalities meant to sing praises for the Premier's agenda, it seems that the Premier has once more been faced from a challenge from within the party, making the starkly ironic scenario that Gysi is removed in very much the same way he came to power in the first place a legitimate possibility.

Hans Modrow's advanced age had been the subject of countless quiet whispers within the Party, making many wonder if Modrow would even seek another term as Premier. As it seems, these suspicions were proven correct, as during the first day of the 17th Congress, Modrow officially resigned his position and announced his retirement from politics. The remainder of the Congress was dominated by attempts to find a successor for Modrow, with countless of the SED's most loyal throwing their hats into the ring. Three major candidates have emerged, former Dresden Mayor Wolfgang Berghofer, influential SED member and former Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Dietmar Bartsch, FDJ First Secretary Eberhard Aurich, and influential diplomat and high-ranking SED functionary Joschka Fischer.

While he may lack the ideological fervor of the Hardliners or the pie-in-the-sky promises of the Progressives, Berghofer's calm demeanor and leadership may yet offer the stability Germany so desperately needs.

Though never considered a major ideological force within the Party, Bartsch's quiet pragmatism and ability to navigate the treacherous waters between Reformers and Hardliners has made him a palatable choice for both factions within the SED. In his first address to the Volkskammer, Bartsch struck a careful balance; pledging continuity with Modrow's reformist legacy while vowing to 'listen to all voices within the Party', interpreted by many as a veiled warning to the Stalinist faction. Recognized as being more reformist than Modrow while lacking Gysi's radicalism, Bartsch is now tasked with keeping the peace within the Party and advancing the Moderate Reformist cause without shattering the Sozialistische Einheitspartei in the process."

Thus the new Premier, [GER.GetLeader], has championed continuing the reforms in a bid to revive the approval and heights of popularity the SED had once enjoyed, beckoning to days where the public - particularly the youth of the GDR - had been optimistic and active citizens, compared to the apathy and outright disdain our citizens have viewed the government in recent decades since Reunification. A further expansion of the Modrow reforms will be in order, with an emphasis on the release and compensation of political prisoners who had been arrested by prior governments, a goodwill campaign which will hopefully bring in much needed positive publicity to the new orientation of the SED."

Premier Modrow himself had only issued orders limiting their more egregious disappearances and unchallenged arrests of public figures, yet halting before any reshuffling of leadership or change in doctrine could be considered seriously. The new Premier [GER.GetLeader] however is taking a bold step forward in reasserting the de jure leadership the Premier and SED leadership has over the Stasi and their operations, with the most drastic change being the appointment of a civil official to head the ministry for state security. It remains to be seen how this appointment will affect the Stasi’s affairs, but the SED is certainly making an attempt in cementing control over an infamously independent agency."

Thus it was a shock within even the reformist circles when Premier Bartsch spoke out against the historically bloody rulerships of Stalin, Ceaucsescu, Hoxha and Castro. Decrying their forms of communism as a complete failure of the intentions of Marx to better the workers and downtrodden, Bartsch has publicly called upon the SED to depose hardline members who would idolize such despotic figures and instead pursue a more peaceful and ‘pure’ form of socialism free from the perversion of dictatorship. Before the shock of the speech could be swallowed and turned into opposition by those hardline elements, a flurry of new decrees and party rulings has been sent down from the Premier’s office, ranging from the ousting of radical elements from the SED to sweeping deregulations of industrial and economic controls. The once totalitarian watch of the Ministry of State Security and the centralized oversight of all facets of life has now been undone in a broad effort by Bartsch to implement a lighter hand of socialism, with more decision and self-sufficiency being given unto the average citizen, although subsidies for society are promised to remain a constant."

Premier Berghofer has begun issuing laws handing over the necessary powers of decision making and crisis management to the First Secretaries of these Bezirk and regional authorities. While some have questioned if this move away from the previously entrenched central planning committees toward more lower level administrations is a move that could radically change how our government works, Premier Berghofer has no intention to emulate federalist governance, and instead seeks a more efficient running of bureaucracy and wider citizen involvement. Indeed, it seems power is not being sapped from the Premiership by these reforms, as Berghofer has also begun removing First Secretaries who had been allies to hardliners in the SED, with any that have taken a too heavy handed approach to dissent and internal factionalism being unceremoniously removed from office in quick and rapid succession."

Those who first led us to victory against our Capitalist counterparts in the West know the ins-and-outs of the system, and remain as competent and qualified as ever even if they are a little rusty in their advanced age.

Born as Margot Feistin 1927, in the eastern German city of Hallem her father was a factory worker who was imprisoned by Nazi authorities because of his membership in the Communist Party. Mrs. Honecker was a telephone operator as a young woman and quickly rose to prominence as a member of Germany’s postwar Communist Party. In 1950, she became the youngest member of parliament in the newly formed East Germany, later having an affair with Erich Honecker, a leading Communist Party official who was married at the time. Erich and Margot Honecker were married in 1953; even if later during their marriage, the Honeckers lived separately, and both were reputed to have had numerous extramarital affairs. During her 26 years as the chief architect of East Germany’s educational system, Mrs. Honecker shaped a generation of young minds and, in the process, became one of the most powerful and most feared figures in the repressive communist regime. She was described as the 'Purple Witch, for the tinted wash she used in her hair, and was called the country’s most hated person, after Erich Mielke, head of the Stasi. Following Reunification, Honecker played an instrumental role in the rise of Markus Wolf, quickly transforming her husband's mostly-ceremonial position of Premier into the main position of power in Germany.

Most had given the reason for the delayed replacement as Sigmund Jähn's distaste for the SED's establishment politicians. However despite this, today, Premier Jähn has announced the appointment of a new General Secretary from the SED's civilian wing. Siegfried Lorenz, a fellow member of the SED's Old Guard, has been appointed in a notable break with the Hardliners. While Lorenz is in the mainly ceremonial position of General Secretary, Jähn's appointment of a civilian moderate is a powerful break with the policies of the last five years."

Jähn, despite publicly agreeing with Margot Honecker's direction, has been privately rumoured to hold more moderate stances on German Socialism, creating a great deal of tension within the Sozialistische Einheitspartei in the leadup to the 17th Congress. With Margot Honecker's passing, Premier Jähn has decided to take a radical new direction, reshaping German Socialism as a more moderate force and publicly repudiating his predecessor's policies. In a firery speech to the Volkskammer, Jähn denounced the 'Red Terror' of old, vowing to free the innocent and restore a vision of Peace and Justice to Germany. While this speech was seen by some as a return to the Moderate Political Establishment within the SED, Jähn's denunciation of 'Career Politicians' as the ones responsible for Honecker's injustice has made some predict that Jähn's new order will be one seperate from both the Progressives and the Hardliners."

Her efforts failed, her attempts at dragging Jähn with her into the grave amounting to nothing. Now, without the shackle of the Purple Witch around his neck, Jähn has made a shocking decision: the decision to publicly denounce everything he had been doing thus far. In a fiery address, Jähn denounced the policies of the Purple Witch, admitting to his own cowardice in the face of the Honecker widow and vowing to undo her wicked evil. The Stasi has been constrained, political prisoners have been freed, and as it seems, Germany is moving towards reform not even a full decade after electing the most radically Hardline combination of leaders in the nation's history.

Wolfgang Berghofer has been appointed as the new General Secretary, signalling a new course between more open and Progressive Socialism, and also shows that Jähn's rhetoric against members of the 'Political Establishment' is beginning to cool.

Fitting with this, Sigmund Jähn has made a shocking decision - abolishing not only the 'Leading Role of the Party', but the Party itself.

In its stead, a nonpartisan body of Soldiers and other high-ranking professionals shall be established, filling the Volkskammer with those who truly have a stake in Germany's future instead of more mindless Party apparatchiks.

The Stasi was sicced, moved to save the Party from itself as Germany teetered on the brink of counter-revolution. Yet now, the Purple Witch, once thought as the unfavorable final word on German politics, is forced to watch in horror as the Stasi takes their due. A system so profoundly horrific that even Margot Honecker cannot in good conscience support it. A new system has taken form, one which Margot Honecker is powerless to alter - a cruel irony to the woman who has controlled Germany from the shadows for so long.

All these counter-culture movements have only gained in numbers and traction as belief in the GDR’s ideals has only decayed over the decades, and those who feel neglected by society have slipped through the cracks into the welcoming arms of these punk and reactionary agitators. \n\nThankfully, the surveillance network of the stasi has long held these groups in scope, even if prior ‘reform’ oriented governments did nothing to combat such societal decay. Now, troops of the Guard regiments and Volkspolizei will flood the rundown shelters and gathering spots of all these washouts, with capital punishment being dealt to those skinheads and Neo-Nazi clubs discovered, Whilst the fools who fell in with the punk music and ‘scene’ movements will be given years of hard labor, to perhaps rehabilitate them into something of a model German citizen."

With few words, Putin made it clear that Germany, a nation he first familiarized himself with during his stint as a simple KGB agent, was to be his new home. A perfect experiment in Securocracy, Germany has surpassed the crumbling Soviet Union. As his eminence dissipated from the meeting halls of Berlin, the cloak-and-dagger puppetmasters lurking in Germany's shadow have been entranced by Vladimir's presence.

Already known for being a pragmatic ‘toe the line’ reformer that was not too dissimilar from Modrow before him, Fischer has retained that image with his slow introduction of continued reformations to the political scene. Most notable of these reforms is the continued reeling in the Stasi, with clear regulations being established that ensure there are some rules that the former unchallenged agency must now answer to. Besides just continued internal reforms for the Stasi, there are even some that directly sidestep and limit their reach as Fischer has begun giving some local Volkspolizei departments the responsibility of carrying out basic investigatory and apprehension work that the former ‘Shield and Sword of the Party’ would perform. While it could be viewed as internal politicking that has resulted in these reforms due to it being known that even the orthodox members of the SED were growing weary of the Stasi involving themselves in governance matters, more seem to stem from Fischer’s own progressive values. The elevation of a ‘Wessi’ to the highest office seems not to be a fluke as the Premier has now begun to appoint even more Westerners within high ranking positions in the SED’s apparatus, thus resulting in notable change for the party’s composition, one away from the Eastern dominated leadership and direction."

Already fulfilling his image as a pragmatic leader, he has started to calm the orthodox and hardliner sections of the party by reeling back the most radical of Gysi’s reforms to the SED structure. Any reforms that had seriously challenged the state controlled economy or Volkskammer bureaucracy have been looked into and changed back to a ‘status quo’ that's acceptable to the apparatus. However, Fischer is not just known for the repealing of Gysi’s hard won reforms, for he has maintained the civilian oversight of the former ‘Sword and Shield of the Party’, that being the Stasi. It appears that Fischer’s role as Premier is acting as the moderating agent for the reformist atmosphere within the SED, ensuring that the former abuses of the infamous Wolf Premiership can not be repeated, while not risking the party’s continued dominance in Germany."

The ideals of the Spontis, while gradually adopted into the SED doctrine, has been truly lost - and while Fischer remains pragmatic enough to denounce the Revisionist ideals of Democratic Socialism, he still leads the crusade to bring a Wessi voice to the discussion on German Socialism. Indeed, it appears that the spirit of the West, once thought lost, now reigns supreme in Berlin's halls of power, as former SED doctrinaires are replaced with more radical, Bonn-inspired faces.

Recognizing the 'Hardliner Purge' under Gysi to be a mistake, Premier Schröder has decided to welcome these figures back into the party once more. The Moscow Line, which has been so carelessly trampled upon by Gysi, shall be restored, as we dedicate ourselves once more to the ideals of Ulbricht, Honecker, and Stalin. Already nations such as Korea and China have praised this course of action, as fellow allies in the Warsaw Pact breathe a sigh of relief for a less erratic German Government.

This recent phenomena of video compilations consisting of maneuvers and field exercises of the Bundeswehr have managed to take the intranet by storm, and have gotten to the point that such propaganda has started to pierce the heavily monitored German intranet lines, to the point that everyday citizens are either perplexed or fascinated by the grainy eighties footage of troops in simulated combat. Such videos typically consist of compiled reels of training, ceremonial and movements of the former Western state’s troops, with the occasional sprinkling of footage of their leaders and flags to reminisce on ‘what could have been’, in a move that blatantly insults the SED, Eastern Germany and our reunification of Germany over NATO’s occupation. Some analysts report that part of the reason for the spread of such content is less connection to the propaganda itself and more enjoyment of the footage of the stunts of the Western border troops, the mechanized movements of the Marder’s and Leopard’s of the Panzergrenadier divisions, and the massed movements of the stahlhelm wearing Federal conscripts, something that can fascinate younger audiences who enjoy military content on the Intranet. Regardless, the Stasi has been working overtime to contain the spread of this content within our typically orderly and highly monitored Intranet sites, but has requested the need for additional digital experts to further control the media fully. What’s further embarrassing is an internal memo stating that upon investigation, this phenomena seems to not be an internal one from what was expected to be nostalgic ‘Wessi’ citizens who had ties to the Federal state, but rather the cause of foreigners who are posting released Bundeswehr footage in videos that are focused around their military ‘aesthetic’ and alternate history pondering on ‘what if’ scenarios on the Cold War going hot or the Bonn regime being the dominant party in reunification of Germany."

The facts remain that the true SPD enthusiastically merged with their Eastern counterparts on the eve of German unification, proudly joining in with the true struggle for Workers' liberation and casting aside their revisionist tendencies. In the years since, the original cadres of the SPD, those who gained control of the party following the failures of Capitalism in the West, have become the cadres of the SED, loyal allies fighting the good fight against Reaction and Capitalistic excess. Olaf Scholz is one such cadre, a member of the Jusos since youth, and an early proponent of a SED-SPD merger since before German reunification. Gerhard Schröder, former Chairman of Juso and revowed anti-Revisionist is another. In the 20 years since reunification, Scholz and Schröder have proven themselves to be loyal members of the SED, and has now turned their fury to the party masquerading as the SPD.

While we have been pressured to denounce the system of the German Democratic Republic in its entirety, the SED-PDS is unique in their refusal to throw the baby out with the bathwater.

Even the 'SPD' has been hesitant to support the community. Despite the church in the East being generally supportive of the LGBT community, Gay rights still remain controversial within the SPD. While they haven't gone as far as to suggest restricting Gay rights, there has been some less than subtle messaging within the fringes of our democracy targeting these groups.

 rw_ger_democratic.47.d:0 "As they forge forward with their new government, the freshly reconstituted SPD has begun to chart a radical course distinct from both its Marxist past and the failure of their Western neoliberal cousins. Drawing heavily from the moral convictions of the Protestant theologians and Catholic reformers who stood firm in the face of dictatorship and founded the Party, the Social Democratic Party has formally embraced a platform of Christian Social Democracy, aiming to merge the twin values of compassion with justice, faith with freedom. With this new direction, the party has proven beyond nary a doubt that this new SPD is not simply a revival, but a reinvention: a party rooted in conscience, seeking to reconcile the broken soul of deeply divided Germany. However as we embrace our party's Christian roots, others have grown weary of the Church's influence. While the Churches within the DDR have typically been intertwined with Progressive and Socially Liberal values, the worries of some that our Religious backing may bleed to the surface has made our Christian roots all the more controversial. From the halls of the SED-PDS, party leaders have echoed the sentiment that our new SPD is nothing more than a sham, a scheme by the church to sully the good name of a long-lost party and in the process force their own version of faith on to the German Public. We hope that these fools will soon be proven wrong in due time."

Traically, the same fate that befell our brethren in the East would occur to their Western counterparts. By the 80's, the inmates had control of the asylum - the Marxist undercurrent which gained prominence in the 70's seized control of the Party, setting them on a course to formally accept East German dominance. 20 years since the SPD and the SED were merged, our new SPD has risen from the ashes of the old SPD, continuing the crusade for Social Democracy even as our elder predecessors fade away. Within the SED-PDS, old cadres of the former SED such as Olaf Scholz and Gerhard Schröder denouncing our new SPD as nothing more than a lie, declaring that the union between the parties remains too robust to undo, and that we are simply masquerading as the SPD, pilfering the legacy of Brandt and Müller that 'rightfully belongs to them'. This grotesque lie has served to do nothing but prove the desperation of the SED-PDS following the collapse of the German Democratic Republic. The Communists are a demented force of the past, and the fact that we allow the SED to continue operations despite their decades of crimes against the German people is simply absurd. Let us get the BfV on the phone, and see if they can't look into the party's operations."

With that in mind, [GER.GetLeader] has unveiled the SPD's new hallmark policy, dubbed officially as 'Agenda 2020'. This new government agenda aims to modernize the welfare state, liberalize the labor market, and restore Germany’s competitiveness on the world stage. Despite the fact that some even within the SPD continue to denounce our welfare provisions as 'rewarding laziness', President [GER.GetLeader] has projected their utmost confidence in these reforms, assuring all within Germany that the SPD's protections to the safety net will not have the effect of increasing unemployment, but will rather ensure that those who do not have the means to engage in traditional employment will still be able to life comfortably. To some, these moves prove that the SPD is a party willing to risk its electoral future to modernize and safeguard the welfare state, while others have declared that these welfare reforms have done nothing but encourage Bums and decimate the spirit of German competitiveness."

During the height of the Bismarckian crackdown of the SPD during the period of anti-Socialist laws, the display of emblems of the Social Democratic Party were banned. However to circumvent this law, social democrats wore red bits of ribbons in their buttonholes. Despite not formally identifying with the SPD, these actions led to countless arrest and jail sentences. Subsequently, denizens who wished to showcase their support for the SPD wore red rosebuds on there person,an action which also led to arrest and jail sentences. The Imperial German legal system ruled that the Red Rose was a party emblem of the SPD, imprisoning those who wore the flower as a political symbol. Subsequently, German exiles spread the red rose symbol of socialism across Europe and to the United States. Socialists such as Johann Most carried the red rosebud symbol with him, prominently wearing a red rosebud on his lapel. In the era since, Roses have become a universal symbol of Social Democracy, even throughout the long history of decline of Social Democratic ideals following the triumph of Communism. Yet here in Germany we have turned the current, defending the legacy of the SPD and proving beyond a doubt that Social Democracy is not dead. Between accusations of 'Revisionism', 'Social Fascism', 'Welfarism' and 'Communist Sympathies', Social Democracy prevails."

However these laws have been abolished, restoring the old FDJ as a legal organization, as well as empowering other SED-PDS organizations such as Sozialistische Jugend Deutschlands – Die Falken (Socialist Youth of Germany – The Falcons) and Jusos. While some have decried this action as another step by the SED-PDS to 'restore' the German Democratic Republic, the party has hit back, stating that the FDJ as an organization were some of the first drivers of the end of Communism, and that their illegalization by the Provisional Government was an unfair action. Furthermore, the SED-PDS have stated that the new FDJ will have no official political affiliations, and will simply operate as an organization which promotes societal consciousness, organizes youth leisure activities, and helps teach essential life skills to our younger generations.

This staring contest between the NDPD and the Bundestag has ground the workings of the government to a veritable hault, ensuring that nothing is getting done on the governmental side of things. Already calls are growing within the executive branch to invoke extraordinary authority to break this stalemate. The President does in fact have extraordinary powers as granted to them in the Constitution, however invoking them would be the most controversial political move of this century. The NDPD, itself deeply divided between radicals and moderates, is split on the issue.

Swept into power in Germany's first free and fair Democratic Elections since the end of the Second World War, the NDPD has made no attempts to slow the party's descent into radicalism, instead embracing wholeheartedly the whims of their most radical members. This has led to the formation of the 'Der Flügel' or 'The Wing' faction, comprised of the NDPD's most radical members, led unofficially by arch-Prussian demagogue Björn Höcke, who has always been renowned as one of, if not the most radical contender for leadership within the NDPD. As it stands, Höcke's cadres are now firmly in control of the party, with the far-right Flügel being formally integrated with the wider NDPD leadership structure. As 'Heimat' loyalists eat their way into the party's core, more and more Germans are left wondering if a repeat of the Third Reich is in store.

These apolitical experts have been left rudderless, however the CDU has seen an opportunity to snatch up these disinterested experts and form a new class of Technocrats within Germany's civil service. One such Technocrat that has gained notoriety is Angela Merkel, a former Minister of Science and Technology within the DDR who has mostly kicked around in the private sector following the fall of Communism. Merkel herself has become influential within the CDU despite her previous Communist leanings, quickly becoming an influential yet still unofficial advisor within [GER.GetLeader]'s cabinet.

Figures such as Heinz Keßler aren't long for the High Command, with a prison sentence more likely than any continued rank in the newly-restored Bundeswehr. However the question of how much we should clear house in regards to the NVA has been brought up. Some favour simply removing the Old Guard, the bigwhigs still deeply entrenched in the SED's ideology. Most NVA soldiers, even those who hail from the West, have utilized the classic defense that they were 'Just following orders' - and given the popularity of Communism's brainwashing before the ideology's collapse, we can't entirely blame them for their mindset. However despite the DDR's status as a German dictatorship with a shocking lack of War Crimes under their belt, others still favour rooting out Communists in our armed forces root and stem, replacing all major commanders whose only loyalty was to the Nationale Volksarmee. While this would devastate our Armed Forces, it would provide an opportunity for 'Wessi' figures within the Army, previously left in a career dead end thanks to Berlin's dominance by Easterners, to move through the ranks. Of course, such action would be taken regardless of if we instituted a purge of former NVA officers within the Bundeswehr."

By the next day, all 27 Bezirke in the West were under Counter-Revolutionary control. Seeing the progress made by Gysi clawed away in one fell swoop was seemingly the final straw for German Citizens, who finally decided to cast off their shackles in a brazen act of rebellion against the Communist Order. The 31 Bezirke still under SED control in the East are intent on restoring order in the West, which has devolved into a state of open rebellion following the overthrow of the Reformist government. With Stasi units being quickly overwhelmed, and NVA units defecting to the new 'Provisional Government' in Bonn, it seems that Germany is now in a state of unofficial Civil War. Schwanitz has given the West exactly 20 days to stand down, however with the fury of the German citizenry at a fever pitch, it seems unlikely that any peaceful resolution to this conflict is possible.

As Germany teeters on the brink of civil war, neither of Germany's competing governments appear to be in a position to challenge this action, and while both Harald Kujat and Wolfgang Schwanitz have asserted that Austria is 'rightful German territory', neither are in a solid position to challenge Austia's recent declaration of independence.

One such movement once confined to the shadows is the ever-Esoteric 'Reichsbürger' movement, a group which claims that the abolition of the German Monarchy in 1918 was entirely ilegitimate. These constitutional revisionist groups reject the legitimacy of the current German State, believing that the political boundary of either the 1871 or 1932 borders still exist and that the modern German nation is 'an administrative construct still occupied by the Allied powers'. Furthermore, these groups argue that the old Bonn Republic was not a state but rather a limited liability company or 'GmbH', and its citizens are merely its 'personnel', which the existence of an identity card proves, a fact which made the reunification of Germany null and void as the DDR merged with a nation which did not in fact exist.

While Georg Friedrich was visibly uncomfortable throughout the three-hour long meeting, thanks to his connections with Reichsbürger leader Heinrich Reuss, the meeting ended in a deal being forged between the Kaisertreue and the Freikorps. Under orders from their 'Kaiser in Waiting', countless members of the Freikorps paramilitaries have disarmed and returned to their homes, while others have been folded in under the guidance of the Prince of Reuss.

A continued Republic would only be handing General Kujat the keys to power, and even if Germany does return to Democracy under a Republic, it would likely end in a third failure.

Armed soldiers surrounded the perimeter of the Kronprinzenpalais early last morning, forcing Kaiser $GER_kaiser_name$ to abdicate at gunpoint. The already-fragile system of Monarchism within Germany has been thrown into disarray by this news, with an additional shock being that instead of Georg Friedrich's next-of-kin taking the throne, a Regency Council headed by none other than the Prince of Reuss shall be assembled.

With the Reichsbürger movement out of the way, it is predicted that the Kaiser will be seeking to transform Germany into a legitimate Constitutional Monarchy, restoring Democracy to Germany for the first time in decades. While the German Empire of old was not *exactly* a Democracy, it was still no stranger to the concept.

In the Reichstag, the new SDP, a party which popped up after the illegalization of the SED following the fall of Communism, has once more entered the running. The new SPD, while denounced by some as stealing the legacy of a party which died after the SED merger, and others as a 'legitimate' front for Bolshevism in Germany, is set to be the main Left-Wing force in Germany once more. Opposing them is the CDU, which has shed their Blockparteien status and has re-emerged as the guardians of Christian Democracy here in Germany. Countless other smaller Imperial-Era parties have also popped up, such as the Zentrum or 'Center' Party, which continued to exist following the fall of the Empire, but has returned to prominence with the restoration of the Empire. However due to their similar stances and voter overlap, the CDU and Zentrum have agreed to form an electoral alliance for the time being.

And indeed, in a sense, it is. However this fact does not matter in the grand scheme of things. Our party was founded by those who wished for change, and while throughout history, the exact nature of that change has varied, our commitment to these ideals has never faltered. The ideals of Social Democracy have survived much, and while it is true that the SPD of the last 100 years is far different from the SPD of today, such is the natural order of politics. The era of Communism no longer defines our party - there is no innocence and no guilt among the cadres who joined the SED following the merger.

In Britain, they've manage to thread the needle - ensuring that local subdivisions have signifigant amounts of autonomy over local matters - while maintaining a strong central government. To solve our current problems, the Reichstag has moved to replace the Constitent States withd devolved administrations. This move has saw Germany become a de-jure Unitary state, as ultimate power over these devoled administrations resides with the Federal Government in Berlin, which can alter their authority as they see fit. This concession for additional autonomy has been begrudgingly aggreed to by Bavaria and the other Southern States. From now on, powers over education, infrastructure, and cultural affairs will now reside with regional parliaments in Bavaria, Saxony, and Prussia, and countless other Devolved administrations, mirroring the autonomy seen in Scotland and Wales in the United Kingdom. While this system remains flawed and imperfect, with some in Bavaria decrying our reforms as paltry and incomplete, the longtime sucess the UK has shown with managing distinct societies within a Monarchist system shows that their system is one that works."

Upon Restoration, countless denizens of the Kaiserreich called for reform of this system, transitioning Germany towards true Westminster style Constitutional Monarchism.

As well, some have called the rise of an ideology known as 'Syndicalism' in Britain and France out as fantastical. Criticisms about how Germany won the war in the game's setting have also been lobbed. Regardless, it seems that the general public still enjoys the game.

Soldiers of the Yugoslav People's Army will advance along with their German and French comrades in an effort to defeat the remnants of the false Warsaw Pact.

With that in mind, Germany has reached out to propose a joint German-French operation to overthrow the Trotskyist Government in Algiers. Such a proposal has both supporters and detractors. Naturally most Communists in France are vehemently opposed to military action in Algeria, considering previous actions by Capitalist French Governments in the past. The prospect of French troops on the streets of North Africa is seen as an affront to Socialism, and has some declaring that [FRA.GetLeader] wishes to engage in Neo-Colonialism and reclaim Algeria for the French Republic. Of course, our intervention would only be one of regime change and an end to Revisionism in the Mediterranean area - however our people aren't so easily convinced.

While the Algerian people stand united behind Hanoune, we are confident that our overwhelming troop numbers, combined with superior technology and an overwhelming advantage in the air will help a quick replacement of Algeria's Trotskyist Government with a true Communist government loyal to Moscow and Berlin.

From the iconic Königsberg Castle, which will be reconstructed to its pre-war splendor once we dynamite the repulsive House of Soviets, to the historic Albertina University, efforts are underway to restore the city's intellectual and cultural vibrancy. The hideous Brutalist wreck of this once-vibrant city shall be torn down, and from the rubble the great King's mountain shall rise once more.

In the wake of his death, the central government in Berlin now faces a delicate situation: whether to allow the Austrian people to mourn publicly or to suppress any displays of grief to maintain control. Others have cautioned that allowing public mourning could potentially galvanize resistance groups and fuel anti-government sentiments, reminding the Austrian people of their lost sovereignty and cultural heritage. Conversely, suppressing such expressions could further alienate the Austrian people and intensify their discontent, potentially leading to more significant unrest.

Despite being situated near the border with the volatile Yugoslav republic of Slovenia, Villach has not had any outstanding incidents to note. This all changed today, as an armoury near the outskirts of the city suddenly lost contact with the Central Army Command in Vienna. Upon further inspection, it became clear that something terrible had occurred, as the unit assigned to protect the city has mysteriously gone silent entirely. As quickly as possible, army units from nearby areas were assigned to investigate, only to confirm the grim news. Austrian resistance cells have raided the armory, absconding countless pieces of high-tech weaponry and killing dozens of soldiers in the process. As soon as they came, they vanished, escaping without any trace, and leaving the Central Command thoroughly rattled."

As the ring of gunshot silenced, law enforcement officers descended on the scene to find the perpetrators nowhere to be found. The death toll has risen to 31, made up of equal portions of law-enforcement officers and civilians caught in the crossfire. Families and close friends of the victims mourn the loss of their loved ones, while in the same breath calling for justice for the slain. In Berlin, Premier [GER.GetLeader] has denounced the 'senseless violence' of the terrorists and vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice.

Dozens of organizations once brought down by infighting have united under a single banner, led by a mysterious figure known only as 'Techniker X' - or 'Technician X'. Technician X is rumoured to hold extensive knowledge of Austrian political affairs and the inner workings of the SED, which would explain the relative lack of information about their person and whereabouts and their seemingly endless connections. There have slready been reports of countless NVA and former Bundesheer soldiers defecting to the so-called 'Austrian Freedom Front', providing them with extensive knowledge of both the inner-workings of the Germany Army and the lay of the land in Austria.

While initial reports are shaky, it seems Austrian Minister-President Walter Baier has been shot dead in Vienna. During a magnificent opera performance in Vienna's Musikverein attended by the Minister-President himself, a concealed assassin struck Baier square in the chest from a vantage point hidden in the theater's elevated service platform. Almost immediately, it became clear to security officials that the Minister-President had succumbed to the gunshot wound of an expert killer. The assassin, disguised flawlessly as a member of the band, struck Baier directly in the heart before slipping away undetected. The weapon used to commit this gruesome murder, was recovered shortly after, and appeared to be custom-crafted and designed to look like a musical instrument at first glance; undoubtedly as a means to sneak past security. Stasi and NVA officials have been ordered to comb the city in an effort to apprehend the assassin... However, given the expert precision demonstrated by this assasin, and considering the wave of unspoken disappearances and resignations by Stasi officials, it is becoming an increasing likelihood that the killer has a degree of intimate familiarity with the Stasi's inner workings."

Unlike the 31 Bezirke in the West, Austria was admitted to Germany in 1992 as a single administrative entity with one government. The Bundesheer was replaced with the NVA, the Austrian Parliament was abolished and replaced by a Berlin-appointed Council, and the elected position of Chancellor was done away with to make room for the post of Minister-President or 'Premier', held by Walter Baier since its establishment until his tragic death. In the wake of Baier's tragic assassination, the SED has been scrambling to fill this vacancy. After heated debate in Berlin, it appears that Heinz-Christian Strache, an influential politician, dental technician and favourite son of Moscow has been appointed to the seat vacated by Baier. While Sebastian Kurz, the young upstart who holds the position of General Secretary of the SED in Austria was seen as a favourite to suceed Baier, Strache himself has pulled a few strings, utilizing allies across the Warsaw Pact and across the political spectrum to secure the top job in Austria. Strache in his inaugural address has promised a merciless campaign to stamp out dissent in Austria, crushing the terrorist threat and working tirelessly to bring those who killed Baier to justice. However Strache is far from an uncontreversial pick, his loyalties to the SED are spotty at best and rumours about his potential involvement with Neo-Nazi gangs in his youth have done little to reduce skepticism.

Of course, most Austrian and German officials have written off Strache as nothing more than talk, pointing to his long history of flip-flopping in a desperate attempt to stay at the top of the Austrian SED's famously ruthless hierarchy. However even if Strache turned out to be all bluster about crushing resistance in Austria, nothing could have prepared us for what had just happened. At 14:00 CET, the entire region of Austria lost contact with their superiors in Berlin. Every army unit, every Stasi outpost, every covert agent, everyone went dark simultaneously. Panicked officials in Berlin have been desperately trying to re-establish communication with Vienna though telephone, radio, satellite and even telegraph... to no avail. The picture is clear now - Strache was never going to crush the terrorist threat. In fact, it appears that the mysterious 'Technician' who has led the Austrian Freedom Front so far was none other than Strache the whole time.\n\nOur illusions of safety in Austria have been shattered.

While dozens of other explanations for the source of these weapons have been offered, it seems that there is only one rational explanation... The Soviet Union, our trusted friend and ally, has been covertly arming the Austrian resistance. Why would they do such a thing? Well, it seems that the answer is clear: Moscow is threatened, and is trying to weaken us so we don't pose a threat to their ambitions in the Warsaw Pact. After all, an open rebellion would surely weaken our standing in the Pact.

Sebastian Kurz, General Secretary of the Austrian SED and previous favourite to suceed Baier before Strache swept the stage has informed his superiors in Berlin of Strache's treachery. Kurz has used his natural charm and charisma to sway a bulk of the Austrian SED away from Strache's side, effectivley dividing Austria's government along partisan lines. As of now, Kurz is our man in the inside, the head of the Berlin Loyalist faction in Vienna and the greatest roadblock to Strache's agenda... whatever it may be. Strache, yet to be removed as Minister-President in an effort to keep the true extent of this situation under wraps, now finds himself increasingly isolated from his compatriots in the Sozialistische Einheitspartei as he works to stall the inevitable fallout of his actions. However time is running out for us too, for if we take too long to get the situation in Austria under control, our tenuous control of Germany's southernmost territory may shatter completley. Of course, we don't expect Strache to stick around to find out - we know his agenda isn't a grand dream of Austrian independence, but rather a pathetic attempt to throw sand into the gears of the German Nation. However Kurz is another matter. While he professes his loyalty to the SED and the 1992 Union on paper, we don't doubt that Kurz would jump at the oppurtunity to lead an Austrian nation free from Berlin's overlordship.

If we are to uphold our image as a stable, utopian Socialist society, then we certainly can't admit that our 'Seamless Integration' of Austria was a failure by invading them. Thus, we are forced to wait the rebels out, discreetley re-establishing control and working to slowly, yet surely vanquish our Seperatist foes.

Local programming went online, as major entertainment, policy, and sport channels from Austria went dark, replaced on their monitors by their German counterparts. The public, still yet to notice the depth of the crisis which surrounds them, has not taken kindly to the shuttering of their local Television programs. However as it seems, life in the DDR is unpredictable this way.

The exact political orientation of Strache and his merry band of Red-Brown ultranationalists is unclear. On one hand, Strache maintains formidable ties to the Communist world, including high-ranking figures within Moscow such as Vladimir Putin and Aleksandr Dugin. On the other, Strache has also been associated both with Fascists within Austria and in Germany itself, boosting these ideologies through his formidable network of allies and utilizing his own formidable bank account to do so. From what we can gather, Strache's true loyalties lie in the almighty Mark - a fact that his lavish expense account has proven.

We have finally made the call to the Stasi Chief, telling them to get over to Austria and start shooting these fuckers dead. At the break of dawn, Stasi units crossed the border into Austria, shooting anybody who raised a fuss. As they re-established communication with their cadres stranded over the Austrian border, units in major cities were quickly broken from their trance, and began the difficult task of restoring control over Austria.

However with the recent Austrian Crisis, many have begun to reconsider their stances against a party catering to Austrian interests.

Cut to 1949, and Germany is once more divided. Throughout the years, the people of East and West Germany ceased to see themselves as fellow Germans, but rather as strangers, denizens of entirely separate nations which happen to share the same language - similar to how Germans previously treated Austrians. However when Germany was reunification, these feelings of Pan-Germanism once more began to swell. Some would say that the desire for reunification on the Austrian front came naturally, others say it was planted by Markus Wolf and Stasi agents. Regardless of how it came about, by 1992, the Three Germanies had become one. While in years since we have abandoned the dream of Pan-German Federalism, as the Austrian Crisis enters our rear-view, those within the SED have once more begun preaching the gospel of Pan-Germanism, embracing the vision of a united Germany not based off of arbitrary borders, but off of one, Deutsche people."

Extensive evidence of Heinz-Christian Strache's corruption was released to the public today, demonstrating his willingness to enrich his political allies and use the awesome power of the Austrian SED for his own personal financial gain. This such behavior cannot stand, which is why Strache hasn't been heard from in months. The final, and most damning piece of evidence against Strache, was a nearly four hour video in which Strache, conversing with an actor who was impersonating a wealthy Yugoslav oligarch, showed a disturbing willingness to violate both the spirit, and the letter of German law to ensure his own political success. Following the release of the sting video, public support for Strache has dried up. Unfortunately, it also seems that support for Socialism within Austria has taken a hit, as the fact that Strache could use the party machinery for his own ends and rise so far up the SED's ladder has shaken the people's faith in our Communist system."

The 'Bezirke' or 'Districts' of Southern Germany, as was typically the case with the rest of the country, were created hastily with little to no consideration to local cultural or political bounds. In many ways, this was deliberately done to whittle down Germany's famous regionalist bent and ensure that the nation remains a strong, centralized Socialist nation - in stark contrast to the Federalism of the old Bonn Republic. However this has also had the unfortunate side effect of fueling regionalist resentment at the SED - a phenomenon which is felt strongly in Germany's south. Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria have expressed great discontent at the suppression of their regional identities by the SED, this fact, combined with the traditional Conservatism of Bavaria have made the process of integrating Süddeutschland all the more difficult. However it seems that the SED has realized their error, and has finally moved to redraw the Bezirke of Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg. While previously several of the West's 31 Bezirke straddled both halves of the old Bavaria-Baden border, now all of the Southern Bezirke have been redrawn to follow the old administrative bounds of the former states of Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria. While this has not solved the chronic administrative problems below the Mainlinie, it serves as a good first step."

The chronic understaffing of the Party below the Mainlinie has become a contributing factor to the phenomenon of so-called 'Southern Sluggishness', and has made efforts to properly integrate Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg into the wider German project all the more difficult. However reunification was ages ago, and the modern generation is among the first to be raised fully under Socialism. The New Guard is appearing rapidly, and instead of shutting them out of party processes, like some of the most entrenched Party elite would have done, we are opening the doors, and letting the younger generation shape and mold the new SED. These continuing efforts to open up the Southern SED will hopefully address the chronic administrative problems plaguing the South, and allow Germany to thrive as a closer, more united nation."

The pious nature of the Süddeutschland people has always been a matter of contention between the South and Berlin, given the State Atheism of the German Democratic Republic. While the majority faith of the East is a lack of one, and the largest in the Northwest is Protestantism, the South remains stubbornly Catholic. Among dozens of other factors contributing to the Southern feelings of alienation, the State Atheism of the Central Government has been a primary contributing factor. Seeing as 20 years of enforced Atheism has failed to take root in the rest of the country, the SED has begun easing certain policies towards Religion, especially in the portions of our country which lie below the Mainlinie. Indeed, it now seems that the official Party line is that, while Germany maintains State Atheism, it will not operate in a way that is actively hostile to organized religion, even encouraging more 'Socialistic' interpretations of Religious dogma in certain cases. To the South, the encouragement of Christian Socialism is an important step forward - without the SED's ever-present crackdown on the Church, feelings of resentment have gradually began to cool ; even if some have still denounced the SED for remaining officially Atheist."

Several Separatist parties operating on both the local and national level have gained traction, and it seems that support for Austrian independence will remain in some shape or form long into the future. If we are to avoid these Separatist tensions from flaring up, it would be wise to keep a close eye on Austrian affairs, lest these simmering ideals of independence bubble to the surface once more.

Despite running an effective opposition campaign, with the memories of the controversial 1992 Referendum being brought to the forefront of the debate, the potential for an economic catastrophe following independence was enough to convince numerous undecideds into supporting the status quo. Unfortunately, whilst this result has satisfied Berlin and those who voted in favor of remaining, the results have failed to satisfy Austrian nationalists who have already begun campaigning for a third referendum arguing that the close vote and precedent set with this election gives them the right to demand [GER.GetLeader] hold another vote. Indeed, unlike the 1997 Quebec Referendum in Canada, which this vote has often been compared too, this result is far from a blowout, as a razor-thin plurality has kept Austria within Germany.

Indeed, any new developments across the Inner-German border are forced to contend with endless committees, compromises, closures and delays, a fact which has contributed to the massive unemployment crisis in the West. That is why the recent approval of a recent Automotive Plant reconstruction has been so notable. The abandoned former Volkswagen plant in Hanover-Stöcken has been cleared to re-open, and will soon be permitted to begin production of new German automobiles. While it has been abandoned for some time now, the factory appears to still be in usable condition, making the renovation effort significantly easier. Some predict that operations could restart within even the span of a few months, if all goes to plan. The only question now is which Automobile manufacturer will be given the rights to the factory. Trabant, as the largest car maker in Germany, is a natural contender. However other organizations have also been lobbying for the grounds. Wartburg, the auto for the Germans with a bit more spare change, would be a powerful force in the factory, churning out moving symbols of German prosperity and middle-class prowess. In that same vein, others have proposed giving the contract to Melkus, the only major manufacturer of luxury cars. Choosing Melkus would limit the domestic reach of these new automobiles, but would also provide the ability to mass-produce racing and sports cars, and would serve to show the whole world just how advanced and prosperous Germany is. Finally, Volkswagen, the previous owner of the factory, has also issued a challenge, demanding that the factory be returned to them.

The industrial project, one of the few in its kinds to pass clearance in the West thanks to large amounts of red tape and a need for Soviet approval, has been a major show of publicity for the SED in their crusade to prove that they can still build things West of the Inner-German Border. The refurbishment of the facility, which proceeded rapidly, has finally finished today weeks ahead of schedule. With the brush and foliage accumulated after years of neglect cleared away, and the rust and rot stripped from the factory's girders, this titanic facility is as good as new, and can quickly get to work manufacturing new cars and trucks. Now, the citizens of Hannover can find steady work in the new Trabant plant, helping to produce affordable cars for the German people to drive. The eponymous car of Germany since reunification, Trabant's opening of this factory has been met with great fanfare by common folk who wish to afford a high-quality and modestly-priced vehicle. However other German Auto Executives have grumbled at the favouring of a company which already operates more factories than any other company in Germany. Regardless, Trabant's deep pockets and even deeper connections have ensured the effortless securing of the facility for use producing their automobiles."

The Wartburg automobile is recognized as the car for Germans with some more spare change, a high-quality vehicle known for having a bit more flash than the typical Trabant automobile. While still affordable for the vast majority of Germans, this new Wartburg plant will pump out high-quality vehicles with a sizable price tag. While some have grumbled that the factory isn't being used to manufacture more affordable cars, Wartburg remains a popular automotive brand for all Germans, regardless of income."

While some have expressed anger that this factory will be used to exclusively manufacture luxury vehicles, a little bit of luxury is just what Germany needs to beat our recent reputation for poverty. Let the roar of Melkus engines and the screech of their tires as they speed through the streets serve as a monument to German prosperity."

Can this new factory opening will help them break back into the consumer auto market? Nobody can say for certain if it can. Some have protested granting Volkswagen's old factory back, calling it a capitulation to Wessi capitalists and denouncing the brand as one of Capitalism and Fascism."

 rw_germany_flavour.12.d:0 "The 2010 Winter Olympics have just concluded. The picturesque French mountain villa has been at the center of a almost decade-long transformation to host the Winter Olympics. While our strong performance in the games was originally the subject of celebration within Germany, the victory of 10 gold, 7 silver, and 5 bronze medals was overshadowed by a doping scandal shortly after the conclusion of the games. Allegations have emerged that several German athletes have been systematically using performance-enhancing drugs, a practice that had long been rumored but never conclusively proven by IOC officials. Already several German athletes have been stripped of their medals, and the IOC has begun a public investigation into German athletes. While the Communist-controlled IOC is unlikely to come down too harshly on the Germans for their use of performance-enhancing drugs, this incident has still served as an embarrassment to Germany, especially due to the Government's noted struggle against drug use at home. The Stasi has been reported to be closely monitoring the incident, and will be playing a more active role in the vetting of Olympic athletes from here on out. Despite this, rumour still prevails that the Government was not only aware of the doping, but actively encouraged it."

Following the conclusion of the First World War, Germany was required to pay a debt of over 50 billion Reichsmarks - a debt which Germany has finally finished repaying. A constant reminder of past defeats and humiliations, these debts have strained Germany's national coffers for generations, and have served as a testament to our nation's previous guilt - justified or not. While this debt was originally shouldered solely by the West, when the two-halves of Germany came together to form one nation, the punitive debts of the old Bonn Republic were inherited by the new government in Berlin thanks to meddling from Moscow, who insisted that if we were to claim the legacy of a united Germany, we were to claim all entailing facets, including the FRG's former debts. Now, almost 100 years, the final tranche of Weltkrieg reparations have been paid off in full. While undeniably a great milestone for our people, the Weltkrieg debts have long been viewed as an embarrassment, and as a capitulation to Western Powers following Reunification. To some, this debt stands as a monument to a hidden resentment brewing towards micromanagers in Moscow within Germany. As we finally part with another vestige of the 'Old Germany', some look spitefully towards our 'Allies' in the Soviet Union, knowing that Germany should rightfully stand as leader of the Communist World rather than the decaying husk of the USSR."

 rw_germany_flavour.15.d:0 "Since the conclusion of the Second World War, the overpowering feeling of the German populace has been one of guilt - guilt towards their past. Indeed, these feelings of national guilt have long permeated the national consciousness, with this guilt being used as a catalyst to ensure such horrific actions would never again be repeated. However the exact shape of this national guilt has taken on a different form in the different halves of Germany. Indeed, in the East, the feeling is one of innocence - after all, the DDR was founded by the scions of Communist Partisans, resistance leaders against Nazi rule. This has unfortunately had the effect of diminishing Germany's national guilt in the wake of Reunification. The East, despite its relative prosperity, remains a hotbed for Reactionary thought. Stasi agents still turn Neo-Nazi gangs loose on punk rockers and other assorted figures the SED deems 'undesirable'. Meanwhile, in the West, it has been taught that Germans bear guilt for the crimes of the Nazi era - and that not only is it entirely appropriate to refuse inhumane orders, it is their sworn duty. This line of thought has understandably been at odds with the Communist regime in the East. As it stands, this 'Kollektivschuld' varies from place to place. While the SED continues to rail against the 'Fascist Forces', at least publicly and denounces the Myth of the Clean Wehrmacht, further declaring that the old Bonn Republic was founded and controlled founded by Nazis, it seems that the SED's Eastern heartland remains a breeding ground for Fascist ideologies - mainly due to the differing educational standards and cultural attitudes towards Collective guilt. While Fascism does seem well and truly dead as an organized political force in Germany, our nation's complicated relationship with its past may become a serious problem further down the road."

While the government has sought to reframe the event as a celebration of Socialist unity and collective joy, the heart of Oktoberfest remains deeply rooted in the traditions of the Bavarian people. Despite the occasional crackdowns on 'bourgeois' influences, the festival continues to draw millions of visitors from across the DDR and beyond, offering a rare glimpse of cultural freedom and festivity in our otherwise tightly controlled society. For many in the West, Oktoberfest serves as a bittersweet reminder of a time when such gatherings were met with little to no scrutiny. Despite our nation's long history of strife and repression, during this festive period, the German people can forget their troubles and enjoy cold beer, warm pretzens, and hearty sausages. These grand festivals, a testament to the enduring German love for alcohol and music, sees the East and West uniting in jubilation, a rare sight in this day and age. The countless lively venues eco with the melodious tunes of traditional brass bands and the cheerful laughter of atendees, as an aroma of roasted meats and baked goods wafts through the stands. While the iconic tents brimming with alcohol and merrymakers may be also crawling with disguised Stasi agents, this festival still serves as a brief respite from the daily realities of life in the modern DDR."

Today, a facility in Austria specializing in the production of amphetamine was destroyed in the middle of an abortive raid. A small fire started during a minor shootout with law enforcement led to a massive fire - ultimately culminating with the facility's destruction in an earth-shattering explosion that was seen for miles in all directions. The facility uncovered due to its ties to a phony prescription-mill run out of a legitimate local pharmacy . It was one of the largest in the area. However the operators of the distribution hub were also tied to a large Neo-Nazi street gang, a gang which has flown under the Stasi's radar thus far. This gang appears to have deep pockets and deep connections, and has managed to escape from justice countless times due to ties to the local SED chapter. While it is unknown who the contact between the Austrian SED and this large drug-dealing Neo-Nazi gang is, it must be someone very high up within the SED for them to escape despite such local infamy."

 rw_germany_flavour.18.d:0 "Rumour has simmered that a large Neo-Nazi march is planned in the City of Dresden. Members of the far-right National Democratic Party of Germany have been in talks with members of several far-right organizations to hold a march in the streets of Dresden as a memorial to the British bombing of the city during the Second World War. This march would be held alongside members of the defunct West German party of the same name, parallel to a massive showing for more open Neo-Nazi organizations. The organization being held by the NDPD, a legal organization without Volkskammer representation, would make any subsequent Neo-Nazi march entirely legitimate and technically legal. Naturally, this has been met with widespread fury and condemnation from fellow Bloc Parties, as well as the VVN-BdA, the Association of Persecutees of the Nazi Regime – Federation of Antifascists. While the SED is staunchly against Communism, the Stasi has been remarkably lenient with countering Neo-Nazi influence in Germany proper, with much of their more harsh responses being focused on Democratic or other Left-Wing domestic opposition. While some favour sending in the Stasi to crack the skulls of these radical hooligans, others seek a compromise, allowing a large counter-protest to go ahead. This way, we can showcase the German People's disdain for Fascism, all while avoiding a scene. What shall we do?"

Artists such as Konstantin Wecker and Die Toten Hosen, politicians from the local SED, the LDPD and the CDU, as well as leading members of trade unions were all in attendance on the anti-Fascist side. The far-right NDPD, upon hearing the news of the counter-protest, quickly called off the march, leaving the open Neo-Nazis alone in their pitiful march. The coalition advocated large, peaceful blockades consisting of large crowds of people as a means to stop neo-Nazi demonstrations, holding up large banners with Anti-Fascist slogans such as 'No pasarán!', a slogan of resistance during the Spanish Civil War. The Stasi refused to intervene on either side, as the counter-protests vowed peaceful civil disobedience within the bounds of our Socialist society. At the end of the day, this event was a triumphant showcase of Germany's disdain for Fascism, and a pyrrhic propaganda victory for the SED. Despite this, the fact still remains that Neo-Nazi gangs within Germany have continued to avoid governmental scrutiny compared to their pro-Democracy counterparts. While this may be due to their continued irrelevance, the fact that Nazism has continued to prevail as an anti-Communist counter culture movement remains as a cause for concern to some."

The NDPD, who aimed to hold a march honouring those lost in the Imperialist/Capitalist British devastation of the City during the Second World War, were quickly faced with a crisis outside of their control as the planned memorial turned into a Neo-Nazi march. The SED-aligned party quickly called off the memorial, however that did not prevent a sizable Neo-Nazi contingent continuing with the events of the day. The Stasi, despite a relationship with Neo-Nazi gangs that borders on the amicable, was dispatched to prevent the marchers from showing their faces. Tensions flared and conventional measures broke down as insults were hurled, punches were exchanged, and blunt objects echoed the cracks of broken bone. By the end of the day, 14 people were veritably beaten beyond recognition by the VoPo, with Stasi guards working quickly to stabilize the situation, as almost a hundred malcontents were taken prisoner. Due to the character of the marchers, even anti-Communist organizations have refused to comment. Meanwhile, the NDPD has been significantly embarrassed by the incident... even if the rallying cry of 'Remember Dresden' becomes more poignant, increasing the organization's support among the Common Folk.

In Linz, a local radio station led by a disgraced former Economist and member of the now-defunct ÖVP has made waves for his radical liberal broadcasts. However unlike other Austrian rebel radio stations, this station has not been hammering the issue of Austrian Independence. Rather, this station and its illusive host paradoxically supports the ideals of Pan-Germanism and European Federalism, albeit under a Liberal Democracy rather than a Communist Regime. Even then, the host of this station has stated on numerous occasions that he believes that the cause of European Unification is his most important agenda, and has suggested at times that he would be willing to throw his support behind anyone who may help make these ideals a reality.

An Austrian himself, Fehlinger-Jahn has long been known as a prominent voice for Liberal Pan-Germanism, making him a powerful enemy of both Communists and the Austrian pro-independence camp alike. Appearing on his show alongside a prominent German General, Fehlinger talked at length about the evil of the Socialist Kurz regime, lambasting his supposed 'Christian' Socialism and emphatically supporting the restoration of the Habsburg dynasty by force if necessary. However the show's episode was also of note due to Fehlinger's refusal to either support or condemn the prospect of Austria's re-integration with Germany, simply stating that he was waiting until the conflict had concluded to form an opinion of the future of his homeland - either Austria's integration as a constituent Kingdom, or its restored independence under the Habsburg Dynasty."

This gamble has apparently paid off, as Fehlinger-Jahn's party has managed to win several seats, narrowly locking the separatist Österreichischer Block out of possible coalition talks. Thanks to the six seats gained in the Austrian Landtag, Fehlinger has been able to serve as kingmaker for a SPD-LDPD-DBD government in Austria. Granted an influential position as Minister of Culture, Fehlinger has now used his radio show as a mouthpiece to support pro-German politics within Austria.

This new smash-hit piece of cinema details the misadventures of a family desperately trying to keep the news of German Reunification from their fragile matriarch, a true believer in Capitalism. The main character, a member of the former Social Democratic Party and an advocate for Reunification, is arrested by the Berlin Police. Witnessing the action, the main character's mother suffers a heart attack and slips into a Coma. After waking after eight months, doctors warn that she is still weak and any shock might cause another, possibly fatal, heart attack, leading the main character to conceal the fall of the Federal Republic from his mother with a series of increasingly elaborate schemes. As West Berlin increasingly adjusted to East German life, their concealment grew more complicated (With the main character having to explain the massive 'Vita Cola' billboard by stating that the company was bought by Coca Cola), as the main character began editing old West German news broadcasts to further legitimize the deception. By the end of the film, the main character, who has gained a high-paying job within the Party, hires a taxi driver who strongly resembles German President Helmut Kohl to act in a fake newscast describing the triumph of the West and unification of Germany under the Bonn Republic after his mother wanders outside to see a giant statue of Lenin being airlifted in to be installed in West Berlin.

The Capitalist West once tolerated these cretins - even though the Green Party had been entirely wiped out within the former Bundestag by 1987. However once the East took command of the German economy, the Green Movement was destroyed in its entirety, as an intense campaign to flush out the remains of the Ecologist cancer was undergone in the aftermath of unification. As of the 21st Century, Green Politics within Germany are dead; however that hasn't stopped particularly dedicated remnants from continuing their futile protests against the Communist regime, alleging that the Warsaw Pact has been directly responsible for countless ecological disasters across the planet. Their most recent target of feeble protest has been the Nuclear Power industry. Despite Nuclear Power being among the safest forms of energy generation, the remains of the Green Movement have bafflingly decided to target several Nuclear Power Plants across Germany. Even though Stasi guards have quickly dispersed these nutcases, the fact that these so-called 'Environmentalists' would go out of their way to target one of the cleanest and most efficient sources of energy generation stands as a testament to the desperation and mind bending idiocy of the sordid remains of the 'Grünen' Resistance."

This film, despite being light on plot on characters, is heavy on explosions, and is perhaps the first true 'Old Hollywood' style movie to come to Germany since Reunification. Barely squeaking through censors, the character of Premier Weißer, based on Sigmund Jähn according to some, has become an instant favourite among audiences, with the triumphant speech delivered by the character declaring German Unification Day to be a holiday celebrated across the world being hailed as one of the greatest moments in all of Cinema.

Officially, an information Cordon Sanitare exists around this issue, with next to no political leaders within the establishment daring to say a single word about the ongoing Opioidkrise.

Mies, already on the way out in the Party, has been relieved of his duties immediately following this outburst. While his comments were reasonable, it is official party policy to speak no evil, to let sleeping dogs lie, and repeat official Party narratives surrounding the crisis. However with Mies' dismissal, a more pressing issue of Party policy has been opened up, as the Wessis, increasingly distressed by the SED's ignorance towards the West, now find themselves with one fewer voice within Berlin.

Of course, thanks to the lofty status of these members, they have been spared from the regular sweeps that typically dispose of junkies on the street - with them often making enough money to afford the highest quality narcotics.

Already handfuls of high-ranking officials have become publicly entangled in drug use, with Roberto Honecker, grandson of Erich Honecker, even being sent to a Cuban rehab facility due to his drug use - and thanks to Margot Honecker's friendship with Fidel Castro. Others, however, such as the relative of German Gymnastics and Sports Association head Manfred Ewald, have tragically overdosed, truly going to show how dire the Opioid Crisis is.

Whereas civilians are shaken down for even the mere scent of Marijuana, as Stasi agents monitor people's homes for any sign of addiction, Party members enjoy virtual freedom when it comes to indulging vice, much to the dismay of the Party's more chaste members. However as the guardians of German Socialism indulge in their addictions, a growing problem within the bureaucratic core is emerging, as overdoses and addictions become worryingly common. SED-sponsored rehab clinics are popping up across Germany to help those high-ranking officials who have fallen too deep down the hole.

The SED, previously quite lenient about drug use within its ranks, has suddenly moved towards a zero-tolerance stance toward addiction, cracking down hard on those within the Party engaged in such illicit activity. The arrest of Schill is one of many chilling reminders that the SED hopes to instill - the reminder that no individual, regardless of rank, is above the law. Naturally, the reaction from the Party has been swift, as addicts go cold turkey, the phones of dealers go silent, and high-ranking officials run to flush their stashes down the toilet, lest the Stasi catch them for possession of illegal substances.

Previously serving as Chairman of the Colleges of State Lawyers, Gysi would fall into obscurity during the Wolf Years, only to secure a roaring comeback during the ascendancy of Hans Modrow. Now, thanks to Modrow's vocal gestures towards the Reformist faction, mainly in an effort to secure his own power, Gregor Gysi has risen as Mies' successor as Chairman of the State Council. The position, made meaningless through years of consolidation of the power of the office of Premier, is still a prominent power broker within the structure of the Sozialistische Einheitspartei. As representative of the most radically Reformist faction of the SED, Gysi's rise is starting to be noticed by those within Berlin. In addition to his reformist stances, Gysi is also one of the most prominent voices for addressing the Opioidkrise, even more than his predecessor Mies.

Despite this fact, the 'Raging Boll' managed to start the match with a strong left hook, taking Najman out of his element almost as soon as the fight began. As the fight progressed into the second round, Najman regained the upper hand - but Boll still held his own in the ring. However by the third round, commentators noticed that Boll had decisively gained momentum, and with a minute left to spare, Boll landed a blow that would immortalize him in boxing history. Boll, perhaps out of instinct or sheer luck, threw a desperate, looping overhand right of his own. The punch, which critics might call his best-directed shot of the evening, connected flush on Najman's jaw. A hush fell over the crowd as the Pole's legs instantly turned to rubber. He crashed to the canvas, out cold before he even hit the mat. The referee immediately waved off the contest, and medical personnel rushed into the ring.

A prominent Anglo-German Left-Wing terrorist in West Germany before Reunification, this man, along with a crack team of heavily armed radicals intent on securing almost 100 million dollars in Bearer Bonds to fund terrorist cells in Quebec, have held the Employees of the state-owned company which occupies the tower hostage. The LAPD, transformed into the UAPR's equivalent of the Stasi following the 1998 riots, had managed to secure the tower's perimeter, and was preparing to send in SWAT teams to secure the building before the hostages could be executed. With the terrorist's background quickly found out through phone recordings and video surveillance, [GER.GetLeader] was quickly made known of the man's identity, and held a lengthy conversation with [PCA.GetLeader] about possible motives and the man's Stasi profile. However before the tower could be liberated by the People's Los Angeles Police Department, an off-duty member of the UAPR's People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs, who had been trapped in the building unbeknownst to the terrorists, had managed to single-handedly disarm and kill many of the terrorists - finally killing the mastermind and leader after a tense standoff. Falling off the top floor of the building, the terrorist leader was pronounced dead at the scene, and the hero Commissar who kept Los Angeles safe has been commended by [PCA.GetLeader]. Despite our lack of knowledge about the attack, the terrorist's credentials with the SED has left us with a thinner line between Berlin and Los Angeles."

 rw_germany_flavour.58.d:0 "The conclusion of the 16th Congress and the resolution of the Opioidkrise has left the Government with some time to focus on more 'trivial' endeavors. One such trivial issue which has been raised within the Volkskammer as of late is the name of Karl-Marx-Stadt, formerly Chemnitz. The city, which was almost entirely destroyed during the Second World War, was renamed in 1953 in honor of Karl Marx, in recognition of its industrial heritage and the Karl Marx Year marking the 135th anniversary of his birth and the 70th anniversary of his death. Indeed, Marx is quite a poignant symbol of German Socialism - given his German birth. However the city of his birth, Trier, was not in East German territory during the time of the 'Karl-Marx-Jahr' (Karl Marx Year). However upon German Reunification, the city of Trier passed into German hands. As soon as Socialist authorities took over management of the city, proposals have existed to swap the Karl-Marx-Stadts, with the city of his birth bearing his name instead. Of course these proposals have been invariably buried in paperwork, with every organized attempt being ignored before it could reach national discussion. But now, with the Government wishing to score a PR victory, a serious proposal to rename Chemnitz back so Trier could be bestowed the name Karl-Marx-Stadt, has been raised within the Volkskammer.

In a park where the Führerbunker once stood, a man who bore a remarkable resemblance to once-Führer Adolf Hitler, was spotted by locals. His uncanny resemblance to Adolf Hitler turned heads as soon as the figure appeared - however despite looking exactly like one of history's greatest monsters, the man, who surely was just a skilled impersonator, was simply ignored by most Berliners going on with their lives. Stumbling through the city, this 'Hitler' was often written off as a street performer comedically interpreting modern situations from a wartime lense. Thanks to the intervention of a nearby Television executive, this impersonator's act of a confused Hitler in the modern day became a hit with audiences. His politically incorrect television program, while a hit, has been controversial without end, with some wondering if this man is truly just a performer, and not an ideologue for modern-day Fascists. Despite this, the 'Hitler' was still attacked by a Neo-Nazi mob, with his lashing out against members of the NDPD generating widespread sympathing and cementing the fact that his act was nothing more than derision and mocking of Neo-Nazism, challenging current perceptions about 'acceptable' portrayals of Nazis. Of course, there are still some who think otherwise - even those who look into this performer's mysterious path, and think otherwise. The mystery of this figure's appearance and the fact that they still don't know the magnetic actor behind the performance has made some think the unthinkable: that perhaps he really is the old Führer come back to life..."

The battle for the German state-controlled retail market is beginning, as Wessi retailers have at last cleared the paperwork hurdle to begin operation in the Western Market. This retail struggle is not between East and West as had often been the case, but between North and South. This rivalry has even extended abroad - as nations such as Yugoslavia, the Italian Union, Hungary and Czechoslovakia siding with Aldi Süd, and nations such as Poland, France, the BeNeLux, and the Soviet Union siding with Aldi Nord. After submitting to the Verband deutscher Konsumgenossenschaften (Association of German Consumer Cooperatives), Aldi, along with competitors such as Lidl, were allowed to continue their independence, however the mend between East and West did not mend the rift between North and South, as the two different Aldi branches remained separate and locked in a bitter battle to see who would gain access to the coveted Eastern market. The Aldi brothers argued over who should own the East. They had already divided the former Federal Republic between them: one sold at low prices in the north, the other in the south. But the rest of the DDR had been uncharted territory, and even to this day the bitter dispute remains. Konsum is rapidly losing its footing, and as it seems, the time has finally come for Aldi to decide which among them gets to sell in the East. Austria has already been gained by Aldi Süd, with Aldi Nord poised to take the East for themselves. But nobody can be sure which giant of this retail war will come out on top.

Food, drink, and merriment shall be provided to denizens across Germany as we celebrate our shared past and future. In the streets of Berlin, parades showcase our military might alongside cultural floats that celebrate our shared heritage.

From Spain to Poland, this black cloud has blanketed Europe in ash, grounding every flight in the continent and having devastating effects on the local economy. The economic effects are already being felt, as supply chains reliant on air freight face catastrophic delays, and industries from manufacturing to tourism struggle to adapt to recent disruptions. Rail and Ship providers have experienced an unexpected surge as air travel becomes impossible across Europe. Ironically, despite the massive environmental impact of the Volcano's explosion, the cessation of all Air Travel within Europe has not only mitigated the effects, but has actually led to a reduction in Co2 entering the atmosphere. Effects of the explosion are estimated to clear up in some weeks as the plume dissipates, and while the damage to our economy from a lack of air travel remains a serious problem, the temporary nature of the disruption ensures that we will rebound from it in due time.

This grand celebration of European musical talent has been held annually since the late 1950's, with numerous geopolitical changes shaping the nature of the contest throughout the years. Since the fall of countless European Governments to Communism, the Eurovision committee has been skewed heavily in favour of pro-Communist regimes, with winning songs often containing thinly-veiled praises of the Soviet Union. This systemic pattern has led to several non-Socialist regimes withdrawing from the contest, with Eurovision's status as a venue for Communist Power projection further solidified when Eurovision merged with Intervision, the contest's Eastern counterpart. Behind the dazzling performances and vibrant stage productions lay a framework of intense oversight and diplomatic maneuvering, ensuring that each entry adhered to the overarching narrative of European solidarity under Communism. Hosted by the Norwegian Federation's Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK) following Alexander Rybak's victory in 2009 with 'Fairytale,' the event saw 20 countries participating, each vying for the prestigious title of winner. The German Democratic Republic's entry, 'Satellite' by Lena Meyer-Landrut, ultimately emerged as the winner, captivating audiences across Red Europe. The song won both the jury vote and televote and was the first victory of Germany as a unified nation - the second victory for a German nation but the first victory of the DDR.

From its humble beginnings as a border guard force under Soviet tutelage, the NVA has risen to become the most disciplined, advanced, and ideologically pure military in Europe - its ranks filled with sons and daughters of both East and West, bound not by nationalism, but by the sacred duty to defend the Arbeiter und Bauernstaat against all enemies, foreign and domestic. A tremendous parade through Karl-Marx-Allee today saw tanks roll past cheering crowds, while Premier [GER.GetLeader] delivered a grand speech praising the NVA’s role in securing our place at the vanguard of the Socialist world. As soldiers march down the streets in their dress uniforms and iconic M1956 helmets, all Germans can take pride in their proud armed forces, confident that these disciplined soldiers would risk life and limb to defend their fatherland if the need arise."

Schmidt's policy was an aggressively NeoLiberal one, and would see a widespread repression of West Germany's burgeoning Left-Wing movement, much like his predecessor. However Schmidt's heavy-handed policy had the opposite effect than intended, instead leading to widespread public support for the Rot Armee Fraktion. As efforts fell apart, the Government was forced to negotiate with the RAF - eventually leading to his Premiership crumbling and the CDU under Helmut Kohl sweeping to power. Schmidt's legacy would crumble as the Socialist-aligned youth wing of the Party rapidly took over in the wake of Schmidt's demise. Having the longest post-Premiership of any former Chancellor, Schmidt has led a quiet life ever since retiring from politics.

Originally, schoolbooks painted a black-and-white picture. On one side: Luther as a prince's servant. On the other: Thomas Müntzer, leading the peasants and fighting for the liberation of the poor. SED-aligned scholars assumed a direct connection between Luther and Hitler, even as some viewed him as one of the great Progressive figures in German history, and emphasized that he contributed to the development of national consciousness. But by the time Erich Honecker consolidated power, the narrative had shifted entirely. In 1983, Luther's 500th birthday, Erich Honecker, who spoke of Luther as one of the most important sons of the German people, had ordered that Luther's anniversary be celebrated as a national holiday. The SED apparatus, which was completely unprepared, could practically throw its textbooks in the trash and had to relearn who Luther was. Marxist historians had to  travel around the country to convey the new view of German history to the SED base.

Parties which gain more than 5% would automatically be granted representation via the Party List, encouraging competition and multipolarity.

This arrangement has been cause for concern for many within Germany, as some wonder if our institutions are strong enough to survive a third shot at Democracy.

The NDPD, eager to crack down on the 'Antifa' street gangs they claim are terrorizing Germany, has attempted to shut down mass demonstrations and action against the current government. However not all within Germany utilize such subtle measures to stick it to those they claim are espousing Fascist ideals. Bjorn Höcke, a concerningly prominent figure within the NDPD, has long been the source of controversy. However now, it seems that he is also the source of widespread ridicule, as Germans from the opposite end of the spectrum join together in erroneously using Höcke's first name as 'Bernd' instead of Bjorn. This trend has quickly caught on, and while the original instance was a simple mistake by a local newspaper, the deliberate misnaming of Höcke has taken off among those who wish to mock the controversial Thuringian politician. This running gag among the opposition has been reacted to poorly by Höcke, who has threatened legal action. By now, even official sources have mistakenly used Bernd as Höcke's first name due to the prevalence of the error."

The chaos that followed has made a permanent enemy out of millions of Germans who remember their entire way of life being taken from them in the blink of an eye. This fact has driven countless young men and women to declare enough is enough. A demand has been made, a demand that Capitalism be clawed back and Socialism once more be embraced. Thanks to this voice, the SED-PDS has been returned to power, constrained by the rigorous safeguards of the new German 'Democracy' but still prevented from dismantling Capitalism once more. To assist in the Party's struggle, countless youth organizations have been brought back from the dead. From Jusos (Young Socialists), the former Youth Organization of the SPD, previously rolled in with the FDJ, the core of which chose to stay with the SED-PDS after Democratization, to the Sozialistische Jugend Deutschlands – Die Falken (Socialist Youth of Germany – The Falcons), an organization existing in some form since 1904, Germany has no shortage or organizations for discontented youth to showcase their righteous fury against Capitalism. While the FDJ remains illegal, the SED-PDS continues to have a voice among the younglings as they work to return to the only way of life they have ever known."

After managing to survive Nazism, the SPD, like Germany itself, would be divided during the Cold War; with the Eastern SPD joining with the KPD to found the SED that exists today. During the process of Reunification, the final process of the SED merger was completed, as the Western DKP and SPD were both joined with the Eastern SED. Since then, we have claimed the SPD's legacy as our own, conveniently omitting the decades of bitter rivalry between Social Democrats and Communists. Western museums have been instructed to display carefully curated exhibitions showing how the SPD 'naturally evolved' into the SED, though visitors might notice the suspicious absence of any materials from 1946 onwards when the forced merger in the Soviet Zone first occurred. The remaining SPD old-timers in the West, those who first founded the Marxist undercurrent which would eventually take over the Party, have been wheeled out for photo opportunities, singing praises of the new Post-Capitalist order and embracing the legacy of the Party. Perhaps most amusing is the Party's attempt to claim both Rosa Luxemburg and Friedrich Ebert as ideological ancestors, despite Luxemburg famously despising everything the SPD leadership stood for."

While Germans once more breathe free listening to videocassettes of artists such as Falco or Heino, one artist has gained a particular acumen among the German public, despite not being a German themself. A popular song by the American artist, 'Looking for Freedom', previously banned by the SED and commonly referred to as song of hope for the people of East Germany, was a smash hit among the German public before Reunification, even being referred to as the anthem of the resistance struggle in Germany. Capitalizing on nostalgic feelings about his iconic song, and a surge of new media emerging following the fall of Communism, Hasselhoff has triumphantly returned to Germany, being welcomed by countless Germans who remember his role in the struggle for freedom in Germany. Despite his name, Hasselhoff is not a German himself - his great-great-grandparents having immigrated to the Former United States in 1864. However, thanks to the German public's tendency to be positively disposed towards anyone with a German-sounding name. His advocacy for tearing down the Berlin Wall and ending Communist rule in East Germany, while falling on deaf ears during his late 80s heyday, has once more been thrust into the spotlight as Germans luxuriate in their regained freedom. Holding a triumphant tour across Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, Hasselhoff has become a hit once more among German audiences, hitting the top 10 in the music charts consistently every day since the fall of Communism, and himself being one of the few artists to go triple-platinum in Europe. Despite trouble with alcoholism complicating his touring schedule, Hasselhoff remains a sensation to Germans, and has been considered to many as an honorary citizen of [GER.GetNameDef]."

The heir apparent to the throne of Austria has managed to gain renown as a talented motor racing driver on his own merits, gaining a slough of fans in Austria and Southern Germany - however he is not the only prominent royal who has taken to the sport of racing. Prince Ferfried of Hohenzollern is also a remarkable racing driver, excelling in the sport of Touring car racing. In an effort to determine who the best royal racer is, a race has been held to see which Royal can make the best time. This event, dedicated to charity, has drawn fans from across Germany and Austria - with both Karl II and $GER_kaiser_name$ in attendance. Unsurprisingly, Ferdinand made the best time, solidly beating Prince Ferfried who hadn't raced in several years.

Indeed, Kaiser $GER_kaiser_name$ has been exploring new professional territory, founding the Royal Prussian Beer Manufactory. The company is headquartered in Berlin, and the brewery is located in Braunschweig. Fittingly, the Pilsner Beer is none other than 'Prussia'. Until now, the Kaiser's very own brand of beer was only sold in northern Germany. However, since this week, it has also been available at a major beverage retailer in Berlin and Brandenburg. The Kaiser's decision to turn to the art of brewing was motivated primarily due to his family interest. Frederick II learned the art of brewing while imprisoned in the fortress in Küstrin, as well, Queen Louise was a fan of strong beer, the Kaiser explained. Working with local managers such as Andreas Mattfeldt, the Kaiser shall establish a truly German brand of beer intrinsically linked to the Royal Family, providing both jobs and a chilled glass of beer to all Germans - and with all proceeds being donated to local charities."

This new Junker class has reclaimed what they believe to be 'rightfully theirs', however this has not come without controversy. The choice to compensate the current owners of the lands has been on a case-by-case basis, with some declaring this move to be itself illegal. Some collectivized landowners have fought back against these new Junkers - and hard, with some standoffs over land ownership quickly turning to violence. The ever-present controversy over the rightful ownership of land has made countless individuals deemed worthy of compensation decide to instead take a monetary payout for land declared to be 'rightfully theirs', and not seek a return of the properties themselves. As we grapple with the consequences of re-Kaiserization, we are always reminded that undoing the legacy of Communism is no easy task.

Hohenzollern Castle by a miracle still stood, with some within the SED wishing to tear it down, others wishing to turn it into a museum displaying the barbarity of the German Empire. However ultimately, none cared about the long-deposed clan enough to do so. Now, countless priceless artifacts have once more been returned to the Hohenzollern dynasty, displayed prominently for all to see and enjoy.

Friedrich Wilhelm and Prince Michael, both now prominent noblemen, have claimed that they have been denied what is 'rightfully theirs', claiming that a share of the estate is rightfully theirs. Due to their marriage, their status as Dynasts was renounced, and they were not entitled to any inheritance - something which the courts of the old Federal Republic would have found to be unacceptable due to the Hohenzollern's dynasty status as being mere commoners.

Indeed, even if the Kaiserreich's return was based on arguably flimsy legal means, even a layman in the laws of the German Empire knows that the German Emperor is the King of Prussia - and vice versa, a fact which cannot be changed no matter what. Reuss has discarded this concept entirely, making no claim whatsoever to Prussia's throne which has been left vacant after Georg Friedrich's exile. Tradition und Leben, the largest Monarchist organization in Germany pre-restoration, has denounced Reuss as a crazed maniac, a despicable Fascist who has usurped the 'Rightful Kaiser' and trampled on their stated goals of a Constitutional Monarchy within Germany. Forced to rely on an increasingly radical support base to stay in power, the 'Mad Kaiser' is in a difficult spot. His own Reichsbürger movement is already on the fringes of German society, and Reuss, despite having a fair amount of credibility among the far-right, is still seen as vulnerable.

Armed with terminology such as the 'Fourth Industrial Revolution', Schwab's ideal of 'Socialism' would surely make Marx spin in his grave. Gathering in the Hohenwerfen Castle, Schwab's forum meets every year to discuss their ideas. Putting forward proposals and talking shop about economics, Schwab's club is a drab affair, only noted by surge pricing for champagne and hired escorts in the area.

Of course, Modrow's ideals towards Bolshevism would not remain, as soon after the war, Modrow made the realization, during his time working on a farm in Stralsund as a PoW. Upon arrival, his backpack was stolen, making him begin to rethink the so-called camaraderie of the German people. While serving as a driver for a Soviet captain, he was asked about Heinrich Heine, a German poet - who Modrow had never heard of.

The Danish troupe of Egon Olsen (Ove Sprogøe) and his cronies Benny (Morten Grunwald) and Kjeld (Poul Bundgaard), are beloved across East Germany, in part due to superior dubbing by the DDR's DEFA compared to the West, and also due to the Gang's talent at improvisation striking a chord with Eastern audiences used to an economy of scarcity. While most Wessis shrug their shoulders at the mention of the Olsen Gang or mutter something about a 'Scandinavian cartoon series', there's hardly an East German who can't at least quote Benny's applause of "mighty mighty." Many older people can still recite entire scenes from the films that were hugely successful in East German cinemas in the 1970s and 1980s. In the land of missing spare parts, the work of a loveable band of miscreants who could steal a few thousand kroner with firecrackers, balloons, and empty beer bottles - cracking the World Bank with a wrench, a jigsaw, two ten-krone notes, and a stack of scrap paper made more of an impression than Western high-tech spies like James Bond, who regularly wrecked the latest technological gadgets and had to transform his car into a submarine at the push of a button to elude his opponents. There are countless fans of these films, including but not limited to Premier Krenz', whose nominative similarity has often been remarked upon.

However Krenz is also comparatively open compared to others within the SED who favour a complete root-and-stem purge of the Party from any progressive organization. Under Krenz, while the SED is tightly-controlled, it is still a big tent organization. This has shown in the recent defection of prominent Western politician Gerhard Schröder to Krenz's camp. Sharing Krenz's mutual love for the Soviet Union and Moscow's way of doing things, Herr Schröder has at last said 'auf wiedersehen' to Gysi's band of reckless Reformists. To reward this man for his bravery in standing up to Gysi's lunacy, Schröder has been rewarded with a prominent ambassadorship as a gesture of good will towards those in the SED's liberalizer wing. While Schröder's previous loyalty to the ideals of the Reformist faction were fraught at best, with Schröder definitively crossing the floor in a show of loyalty towards the Premier has shown that more and more Progressives have recognized that their struggle is over.

An 'Ossi' as such a prominent voice for the resistance movement is a disaster waiting to happen. Gauck must be dealt with, by any means possible.

Interestingly, while some have been as bold as to call for an 'Aryan' homeland in Germany, and the expulsion of the Turkish minority referred to as 'Capitalist' Agitators, the fact remains that Premier Wagenknecht herself is half-Persian.

Despite their ideological differences, the two became close, and eventually married shortly after Wagenknecht's ascension as Premier. The fact that Lafontaine was already married at the time of his engagement, combined with the fact that Wagenknecht is 26 years his junior has led to a certain amount of conversation both within Berlin's halls of power and within Germany's gossip-prone population. Regardless, thanks to the burgeoning Cult of Personality surrounding Premier Wagenknecht, the First Gentleman of German Socialism has been pulled in as well, with crowds hailing their union as a symbol of the happy marriage between the East and the West. Despite a noted difference in ideology, Lafontaine has not spoken out against his wife's status as an ardent Stalinist. Whether this is out of respect for his partner, or out of a genuine change of heart, it seems only Lafontaine and Wagenknecht know."

Hoping to shore up relations with nations typically critical of the Soviet Order, Gysi has visited New York as part of a five-day tour of the nation, culminating in a visit to New York City's Ground Zero - where so many died during the tragic May Day Attacks. However this visit has not gone as planned. The media pool, instead of following Premier Gysi, has instead mistakenly followed a member of the Commonwealth's acting guild, Jason Alexander. The American Actor, who bears a striking resemblance to the Premier, was promoting a television show with writer Larry David when media covering Gysi's State Visit mistook him for the German Leader. Instead of correcting them, Alexander led the press on a wild goose chase across New York City, indulging in the fine life due to misconceptions he was in fact a foreign dignitary. Despite showing no proficiency in German, putting on an exaggerated German accent which none appeared to catch on to, Jason Alexander was able to continue his escapades throughout the city before anyone could notice, even being clear to meet [NEA.GetLeader] for a ceremony at the Twin Towers. Of course, Gysi's detail had been noticed by this point, and Alexander was forced to drop the act and flee. The actor has thus far escaped any consequences due to the hilarity of the incident.

The insistence of these reporters, combined with the fact that Gysi was separated from his bodyguards, caused the Premier to flee in terror from the two men, seeking shelter in one of the Palast der Republik's many restrooms. What followed can only be described as a farce worthy of a comedy sketch - the Premier of the German Democratic Republic, leader of Europe's second-most powerful Socialist state, barricaded himself in a toilet stall for nearly forty minutes while his security detail frantically attempted to locate Gysi. The incident was captured on film by a tourist from Poland, and despite the Stasi's best efforts to confiscate all evidence, grainy footage of our Premier's feet visible under the stall door while reporters shouted questions about Agricultural quotas has already begun circulating in opposition media. The State Media has spun the incident as 'Premier Gysi's dedication to inspecting public facilities' or the 'Barbarity of Tabloid Journalism', though even the most loyal Party members have struggled to keep straight faces when discussing the matter.

Eventually, Byung-Chul Han would become a household name in philosophy, with his work being popular especially in Latin America. His concepts of the 'Müdigkeitsgesellschaft' (Fatigue Society) and 'Transparenzgesellschaft' (Transparency Society) have struck a particular nerve among Western intellectuals, who see in his critiques a thinly-veiled condemnation of the DDR's surveillance apparatus and the exhausting performance of socialist loyalty demanded of all citizens. While Han carefully frames his work as a critique of late-stage Capitalism and NeoLiberalism, any fool can see the parallels between his description of self-exploitation and positive control with the reality of life under the watchful eye of the Stasi. The Party has allowed his work to circulate, believing it serves as useful criticism of the decadent West, yet whispers in university corridors suggest that Han's true genius lies in crafting a philosophy that speaks to both sides of our divided nation - condemning the Capitalist past while subtly undermining the Socialist present. Of course, such interpretations are merely the fevered imaginings of reactionary elements, and Professor Han remains a valued member of the Humboldt University faculty, though one notes the frequency with which his lectures are attended by men in leather jackets taking copious notes."

Despite the Party's attempts to present football as a unified expression of German socialist excellence, match days between Eastern and Western clubs regularly devolve into displays of barely-concealed regional animosity, with Western fans chanting coded protests that toe the line of what the Volkspolizei will tolerate. As well, inter-Ossi rivalries exist between teams, such as BFC Dynamo being the target of scorn from the working class 1. FC Union Berlin. A similar rivalry exists between 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig and BSG Chemie Leipzig. The beautiful game, it seems, has become yet another arena where the contradictions of our 'unified' Germany play out for all to see.

While Beck was permitted to continue his academic work after reunification, his concepts of 'Reflexive Modernization' and 'Cosmopolitan Realism' were viewed with deep suspicion by Party ideologues, who saw in them a barely-disguised critique of Socialist Central Planning and the DDR's environmental disasters. The Volkszeitung's obituary praises him as a 'Critical voice against Western Capitalism', conveniently omitting his numerous essays warning about authoritarian responses to manufactured crises - essays that circulated widely in Western academic circles before being quietly removed from university libraries.

Upon German Reunification, the soda of choice among German drinkers went from Fanta, the Hitlerian drink, to Vita-Cola, a strong Socialist soda. Unlike the disgustingly sweet Fanta, Vita-Cola has a tangy taste, utilizing fruits such as lemon. It also has a noticeably thicker consistency due to its use of citrus and other aromatic oils in the formula. Thanks to the mineral water used in its formula, it is also undeniably a healthier choice than the West German Fanta. Despite the obvious inferiority of the West's Hitler Cola, Fanta still remains popular among West German tastebuds, as Wessi drinkers attempt to recapture the taste of their Capitalist childhood with every sip of this rotten concoction. This cannot stand. We need to ensure that the German Volk are slurping proud Socialist Sodas instead of the Hitlerian Degeneracy and extension of American Coca Cola Capitalism that is Fanta. Along with our other major SED-aligned Soda, Club Cola, the Volkspolizei has begun a crackdown on those brewing bootleg 'Fantasie', publicly making a display of pouring the neon orange liquid down the sewer drains.

A 1990 crossover episode of both shows, 'Unter Brüdern', touched on the relationship between the two programs, with the new Western Volkspolizei branch aiding their Eastern Comrades in solving a mystery, and showing the old Wessi officers changing into their new Volkspolizei uniforms, indicative of German Reunification itself.

It was the last election to be held in West Germany, and saw a record-breaking low for establishment parties, giving several once-fringe right and left wing extremist parties representation in the Bundestag for the first time in West German history. The German Communist Party went from having no seats in the Bundestag to having over three dozen in the span of a single election, an astonishing show of support for Communist systems by German voters in the wake of renewed economic hardship. As well, the Marxist wing of the Social Democratic Party further entrenched themselves within the party, laying the groundwork for the SPD's wholehearted acceptance of East German unification. Meanwhile, several far-right parties such as the Free German Workers' Party and the National Democratic Party saw themselves winning dozens of seats, while other contemporary establishment parties such as the Green Party were wiped out entirely. The ruling CDU and opposition SPD both saw the combined losses of more than 100 seats, causing the traditional 'GroKo' coalition arrangement to fall woefully below the needed number of seats to secure confidence in the Bundestag. On the instruction of the SDP, Chancellor Kohl formed a once-unthinkable coalition between the CDU, the SDP, and the West German Communist Party. The inclusion of the Communist Party in the Grand Coalition was the first break in the firewall around the far-left in German Politics, legitimizing the ideology among the German citizenry, while also leading to widespread outrage over being shut out of the mainstream political system from the Right. The outcome of this election showed a remarkable breakdown in social order, as extremists from both sides of the political aisle protested the results of the election as being illegitimate. These feelings of political disillusionment of the early 80's economic crisis were ultimately the straw that broke the camel's back for West Germany, as sentiment to abandon the failing Capitalist political system and throw their lot in with East Germany became mainstream."

By the mid 1980's, the Wall's goal of preventing the influx of defectors from East to West Berlin had become depreciated, as the West German economic situation had become so dire that the flow of movement was now in the other direction, with West Germans attempting to flee East in search of better jobs and economic opportunities. As relations cooled with the West, the Wall's dismantlement became a mutual aim of both parties - even if action to do so became bogged down in paperwork, and the will of those in the SED wishing to protect East German jobs from Western defectors. Ultimately, the political momentum to tear down the wall came to fruition in 1989, when high-ranking SED official Günter Schabowski mistakenly declared that West Germans would be free to emigrate East effectively 'Immediately'. The sudden influx of German citizens desperate to reconnect with friends and family bisected by the wall ultimately led to the overwhelming of border station, and later in the night, the impromptu demolition of the wall by Berliners. Jubilant crowds wielded hammers and pick-axes against the wall's graffiti-covered surface, joining their kin on the other side for the first time in decades in shared celebration. By the end of the week, the wall had been almost entirely dismantled by both citizen and official action, with chunks broken off the wall quickly becoming highly-coveted souvenirs both in the West and East of Germany. Western leaders, caught off guard by this dramatic reversal, could only watch as their hopes for a Democratic Germany crumbled alongside the Wall's concrete segments. The wall's physical destruction became a powerful metaphor - not for the defeat of Communism as many had expected, but for the DDR's ascendance as it absorbed its Western counterpart into what would become Europe's dominant economic and political force, second only to the USSR itself."

West Germany, faced with a long period of decline and rise of Communist sympathies, formally joined their brethren in the East after decades of division. The 'Grand Coalition', which was formed after the Election in the year's early months led to a Communist surge, began to strain not long after being formed. Chancellor Kohl, under pressure from his left-wing coalition counterparts, began opening the line to his Eastern counterparts. The Communist Party, which had been surging in the polls since 1987, has secured a key partnership with the SDP, and agreed to break up the Grand Coalition government if Kohl refused to support German Unification. While originally the CDU proposed the creation of a neutral 'United Republic of Germany' which would be ruled by neither the East nor the West, gradually, public opinion shifted towards wholesale annexation by the German Democratic Republic. As it became clear that the public will had begun to favour Communism over capitalism, all parties within the Bundestag began gradually accepting re-unification as a realistic and desirable possibility. After a formal meeting between parties in the West and East, a near-unanimous vote in the Bundestag, only opposed by the FDP and a collection of far-right parties was held, putting forward the proposal of union with the East. In East Berlin, a fully unanimous vote in the Volkskammer, set the adoption of the provisions of German into motion, formally beginning the process of German Reunification. The German States, starting with Berlin, which had elected a Socialist government led by the SED's counterpart in West Berlin (the Sozialistische Einheitspartei Westberlins) in 1985, all voted to ratify German Unification - with the sole exception of Bavaria. After a brief crisis which included the violent overthrow of Bavaria's government, Bavaria formally voted to join with the DDR, putting to bed any concept of an independent Bavaria and formally completing the process of German Reunification. While the original treaty uniting the Two Germanies originally envisioned a Democratic and Neutral nation, it quickly became clear that the DDR would subsume the former structure of West Germany in its entirety, which became apparent after a rapid expansion of the Stasi into the West and a renewed crackdown on dissidents.

Pressured by the SED to relinquish some of his duties, Egon Krenz eventually found himself thrust into the position of General Secretary as Honecker's successor, while Honecker himself remained in the mostly-ceremonial post of Chairman of the Council of Ministers, renamed officially to 'Premier' after Reunification. Krenz announced minor reforms aimed at appeasing denizens in the West and making the Communist transition; however these meager gestures were bitterly opposed by some within the SED, mainly Markus Wolf, who was widely accredited as the one to put down dissent in the former West after reunification. Honecker, who still held the title of Premier, was pressured to delegate more power and authority to the office in the final years of his life. Under the influence of Wolf and his wife, Margot, the position of Premier found itself exceeding the authority of General Secretary for the first time, leaving the ailing Erich Honecker in de-facto control of Germany once more. Upon his death in 1991 shortly before the 12th Congress, a letter was uncovered recommending Markus Wolf take up the position of Premier, and with the support of Honecker's widow, Wolf found himself elevated to the position of Premier, and put into the supreme position of power within the DDR after a near-unanimous vote in the Volkskammer. While the General Secretariat would still hold de-jure power due to the SED's status as being a Party 'Above the State', it became clear by the turn of the 21st Century that true power within the DDR lied with Premier Markus Wolf. Egon Krenz would find himself increasingly alienated by the SED establishment under Markus Wolf in later years, eventually being replaced as General Secretary by popular Air Force general Sigmund Jähn.

This referendum was held in the immediate aftermath of the 1992 Presidential Election, which saw Communist Candidate Walter Baier, who was currently serving as Chancellor, defeat Otto von Habsburg, former heir to the Austrian throne. The rift between the Chancellor and Austrian President Kurt Waldheim was well-known within the small Alpine nation, with the KPÖ hoping to propel their own candidate to victory and remove all remaining safeguards to Communist Rule. Bitterly opposing them was Otto von Habsburg, an independent candidate driven to oppose the Communists in the wake of the failure of the Pan-European Picnic. All remaining political parties aside from the KPÖ backed Habsburg in a desperate attempt to prevent the Communists from seizing complete power - however in a narrow margin, Chancellor Baier secured the position of Chancellor and President. Shortly after, Baier merged the two positions and illegalized all remaining opposition parties. Under pressure from DDR leadership, Baier began serious discussion of unification with Germany, holding a referendum which overwhelmingly passed.

West Germany was among those hit the hardest by these sanctions, as a shortage of vital supplies and massive unemployment in the wake of the American economic crisis saw the East become more prosperous than the West for the first time in German history. With falling living conditions in the West, and rising prosperity and economic opportunity in the East, the tide of Defectors from East Germany gradually stemmed, and led to the rise of Westerners fleeing the other way around in search of jobs and better living conditions. An improving economy and quality of life in the East would lead to the rapid shift in public perception of Communism, and the rise of many left-wing movements favouring reunification and rapprochement with the Government in the East.

The primary hardliner candidate, Egon Krenz, was known as a figure more willing to compromise and offer token reform, a stance which was opposed by radicals such as General Secretary Sigmund Jähn and widow of former Premier Erich Honecker: Margot Feist. However Krenz's penchant for compromise would not see him launched to the top echelon of DDR leadership once more, as the bulk of the party quickly showed favour to the moderate reformist stances of Hans Modrow.

In the Soviet Union, Politburo members were more than skeptical of the prospect of Western absorption, with some in Moscow favouring using their influence in East Germany to veto German Reunification. While the DDR was a de-facto independent nation, in reality they operated more as a Soviet satellite, one which could easily cease to function if they got on the USSR's bad side. Ultimately, a compromise was reached between Moscow and Berlin to avoid potential conflict and gain recognition for the new Germany. To ease fears of potential German remilitarization, the Western half of Germany underwent extensive deindustrialization, crippling Germany's ability to wage offensive war in the future. This policy, while succeeding in appeasing the Soviet Union and putting to rest the fears of a reemergence in German expansionism, led to a massive spike of unemployment in the West as efforts to integrate the economies of the two Germanies stalled shortly after.

Despite a harsh crackdown and the Rebellion's ultimate failure, the uprising ultimately spurred the emerging Sozialistische Einheitspartei to introduce extensive reform to East Germany. With heavy prodding from Soviet leadership, particularly Lavrentiy Beria, greater liberalization and economic reforms would be introduced in the DDR, paving the way for greater economic prosperity in the East relative to both the Eastern Bloc, and later, their Capitalist counterparts in the West. The success of the 1953 reforms are recognized as playing a key role in the eventual Reunification of Germany under the Communist East."

 ger_history.11.d:0 "The 'Austrian Compromise' or 'Österreichischer Kompromiss' was a series of reforms intended to prevent widespread civil disruption from the integration of the People's Republic of Austria into Germany, which was itself part of an effort to lay the groundwork for broader pan-European integration. The compromise detailed the respecting of Austria's unique identity and an affirmation of Austrian nationhood, leading to a formal rejection of Pan-German ideals during the period of transition following the Red Anschluss. In following with this agreement with Austrian Communist leaders, Austria was not admitted into the GDR as several separate Bezirk or 'Districts', like when West Germany was first integrated, but rather as one contiguous entity with a parallel administration to Germany. The Austrian KPÖ (Kommunistische Partei Österreichs/Communist Party of Austria) and SPÖ (Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreichs/Social Democratic Party of Austria) were merged into the Austrian SED, while other Austrian Parties were merged in with the various Bloc Parties, such as the ÖVP (Österreichische Volkspartei/Austrian People's Party) being merged with the CDU and the FPÖ (Freiheitliche Partei Österreichs/Freedom Party of Austria) being merged with the NDPD. While some agree that Germany respected the 'Distinct Nationhood' of Austria following integration, others view the subsequent crackdown by Markus Wolf as proof that Germany had betrayed their promises to respect the identities of both Austria and Southern Germany."

Under Brandt, West Germany sought to normalize relations with East Germany, Poland, and the Soviet Union through extensive dialogue and treaties, acknowledging the post-war realities and borders that had coalesced since the beginning of the Cold War. Among the treaties signed during the period of 'Ostpolitik' were the Permit Agreement, the Treaty of Moscow, the Treaty of Warsaw, the Four Power Agreement on Berlin, the 1971 Transit Agreement, the 1972 Basic Treat, and the 1973 Treaty of Prague. Despite Brandt's harsh treatment of domestic Communism, his strategy towards the GDR laid the groundwork for closer relations between the two halves of Germany and its eventual reunification under the Communist East. While the policy has been decried by Conservative elements for its role in the Communist victory in Germany, others believe that the policy was instrumental in preventing the fall of the Bonn Republic from devolving into violence and an open war to reunify Germany. Brandt himself would be brought down during the Guillaume Affair, where one of his primary assistants, Günter Guillaume, was revealed to be an East German spy."

 ger_history.14.d:0 "1968 was a turbulent year for West Germany, as an increasingly radical and Socialist-aligned student movement took hold in protest of perceived authoritarianism, the Vietnam War, and the lingering influence of Nazi-era structures within West German institutions. The emergence of this movement marked a pivotol moment in the history of the Federal Republic, as university students across major cities organized mass demonstrations in support of Socialism and in opposition to conventional establishment politicians. Led by figures such as Rudi Dutschke and the Sozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund, these protests represented the first significant manifestation of radical left-wing sentiment in post-war West Germany, and while these movements were initially opposed to Soviet Stalinism, these movements would sow seeds of dissent that would later flourish during the economic hardships of the Hard Eighties. The failed assassination attempt on Rudi Dutschke would also greatly contribute to the Studentenbund's expansion, with government efforts to contain the movement falling apart by 1969. The movement's emphasis on anti-capitalism, anti-imperialism, and democratic socialism, in opposition to the increasingly NeoLiberal SPD-FDP coalition government, established a critical intellectual foundation that would eventually contribute to the legitimization of Communist ideals among the West German populace, despite harsh government crackdowns at the time. The pioneers of the 68er-Bewegung would play a key role in the Hard-Left reshaping of the SDP following Brandt's demise, and eventually, in the integration of West German systems into the Eastern SED by the time of Reunification."

 ger_history.15.t:0 "German Autumn"
 ger_history.15.d:0 "'German Autumn' was a period in 1977 marked by left-wing agitation and resistance from an increasingly militant Communist movement. The Rote Armee Fraktion (Red Army Faction), also known as the Baader–Meinhof Group or Baader–Meinhof Gang, began a series of high-profile actions intended to expose the vulnerabilities of the capitalist establishment. Sparked by the arrest and trial of key RAF leaders, the RAF's began with the killing of Federal Prosecutor General Siegfried Buback and later Dresden Bank AG spokesman Jürgen Ponto, as well as the kidnapping of industrialist Hanns Martin Schleyer, and the hijacking of Lufthansa Flight 181. The escalation of violence between radical leftist groups and the West German state reached its zenith during October 1977, as kidnappings, assassinations, and bombings became commonplace throughout the Federal Republic. The government's heavy-handed response, including expanded police powers and mass arrests, only served to further radicalize the population and drive sympathy towards Communist ideals among those who viewed the actions of Helmut Schmidt's GroKo Government as being authoritarian and counter to the ideals of Social Democracy. Due to perceived overreach and ineffectiveness in dealing with the Revolutionary cells, the Government response would widely be regarded as a failure by the public. By November, comrades from the Rot Armee Fraktion came to liberate their comrades in the storming of the Weiterstadt Prison, and after the police response led to almost 30 bystanders being killed in the crossfire, the Government was forced to negotiate with RAF leaders. Ultimately, Schmidt's failed approach would lead to the collapse of the SPD's NeoLiberal faction and the later dominance of the party by the burgeoning Marxist youth movement. Although the immediate crisis of terrorism by the RAF and Revolutionary Cells was contained by year's end, the events of German Autumn fundamentally undermined public trust in West German Democracy and created countless martyrs, such as Andreas Baader, Ulrike Meinhof and Gudrun Ensslin, whose legacy would be invoked during the Communist surge of the 1980s, playing a key role in the eventual reunification of Germany under Eastern auspices."

 rw_germany_news.20.d:0 "In a shocking upset, news has broke from Berlin that Hans Modrow, Premier of the German Democratic Republic or 'DDR' since the death of Markus Wolf in 2006, has been voted out as Premier of Germany during the 16th Congress of the SED. As is tradition, Modrow joined with his cadres to vote for his own removal once it became clear he had lost the Party's confidence. Despite leadership that has received muted praise through Germany's Opioidkrise, it appears that Premier Modrow was unable to convey the confidence of the SED for the Second Time. The moderate-reformist Premier has been succeeded by General-Secretary Angela Merkel, a dark-horse candidate who was recently confirmed to Germany's second highest ranking position after the retirement of Sigmund Jähn. Merkel, a Technocrat with a notable streak of Russophobia, is a strongly Europhilic candidate who has often come to brush with her 'superiors' in Moscow. Merkel, cautiously supported by both Moderates and Conservatives, holds no allegiance to either wing of Germany's Socialist Unity Party, instead following her own unique system of Socialism. With this shocking shakeup in German leadership, the future of the Socialist World has been thrown into question once more, as observers ponder the future of Germany under this previously unknown outsider."

The moderate-reformist Premier has been succeeded by General-Secretary Gregor Gysi, a shocking choice widely recognized as the most reformist figure within the SED, who was recently confirmed to Germany's second highest ranking position after the retirement of Sigmund Jähn. Gysi's rise to power is a deadly blow to the Hardliners and a signal that legitimate change is coming to Germany. Backed by a burgeoning pro-Democracy movement and much of the areas contained in the former Federal Republic of Germany, Gysi's rise as Premier has thrown a significant wrench into the Socialist World, making many ponder if Democracy is truly coming to Germany, or if Gysi's many enemies will stop him before he can jeopardize the status of the Socialist System built in Germany in the years after reunification."

 rw_germany_news.22.d:0 "After a nail-biting seven days in Berlin, news has finally come out that Egon Krenz, Premier of the German Democratic Republic or 'DDR' who gained power in a palace coup last year, has secured his position as paramount leader of Germany for the next five years. The hardliner who secured power in Germany due to Hans Modrow's failures to address Germany's Opioid Crisis, many have pondered if Krenz intended to stay on as leader of Germany, or yield to the younger generation and cede power to another candidate. As it appears, Krenz, alongside General-Secretary Sahra Wagenknecht, has made clear his intention to remain as Germany's paramount leader. Previously serving as General-Secretary before the position was rendered powerless by Markus Wolf, Krenz has been recognized as a moderate among hardliners. Despite a firm opposition to the Modrow reforms, Krenz still supports limited reforms to prevent discontent and violence in the West of the country. The Congress itself was widely recognized as a formality, with Krenz's lack of retirement making the entire affair nothing more than the party endorsing the Premier's agenda for the next five years - one which includes strengthening Germany's historic links with the USSR and avoiding any German attempts to usurp Moscow's power."

 rw_germany_news.23.d:0 "After widespread speculation about a possible retirement, it seems that the suspicions of international observers were proven correct today, as German Premier Egon Krenz announced on the opening day of the SED's 16th Congress that he was officially retiring from politics. In the wake of several high-profile retirements within Germany's SED, maverick Hardliner and immensely popular figure within the German Cabinet, Sahra Wagenknecht, has been elected as Premier of the German Democratic Republic. Wagenknecht, despite being a hardliner, is renowned for her unclear policies on major issues, making her more aloof than her now-retired counterparts such as Sigmund Jähn or Egon Krenz. As the Old Guard is pushed to retire, Wagenknecht stands at the forefront of the nation's youth revolution, making her play and preparing to move forward from the inflexible factionalism which has gripped Germany for so long. Experts are divided over which direction she will take, with some predicting that her rule will lead to greater reform, while others argue that her reign will be more despotic than Egon Krenz. Regardless, Wagenknecht stands as a strong proponent of German Nationalism, a stance which has also made her stand out from compatriots within the SED who are far more quiet about Patriotism than this controversial member of the New Guard.

 rw_germany_news.24.d:0 "After widespread speculation about a possible retirement, it seems that the suspicions of international observers were proven correct today, as German Premier Egon Krenz announced on the opening day of the SED's 16th Congress that he was officially retiring from politics. However, instead of a younger leader taking charge, it seems that the Old Guard has persevered still, as Sigmund Jähn, General-Secretary and popular Air Force General, has been elected as successor to Egon Krenz. Jähn, a very popular NVA General, is backed by Margot Honecker, widow of Erich Honecker, the man who presided over German Unification. While Jähn has expressed a need for greater military involvement within the SED, many have come to believe that Jähn serves only as a charismatic figurehead for Margot Honecker, who is truly pulling the strings of Government as General-Secretary - an interesting irony considering her role in whittling down the position during Krenz's tenure. Open conflict between Jähn and Honecker remains unlikely, even if a highling between Jähn's military-backed Paternalism and Honecker's ruthless pragmatism become apparent. Regardless of who's really in charge, it seems that Jähn's election is another radical step backwards for a Germany which appeared to be on the pathway to legitimate reform under Hans Modrow."

 rw_germany_news.25.d:0 "After a shocking series of events in Germany, it seems that the nation's omnipresent intelligence agency, the Stasi, has formally moved to depose recently-elected Premier Gregor Gysi. The agency, which has been at the center of a silent battle for supremacy within the German Government, has at last come out on top. With the SED itself purged of Hardline elements, Germany's MfS has taken the nation's future into its own hands, marching on Berlin with a contingent of military loyalists to formally put a halt to Gysi's attempts at immediate democratization. Wolfgang Schwanitz, the longtime head of the agency, was elected by the SED at gunpoint after an emergency Party Congress was called. During Schwanitz' first and most likely only public address as Premier, the elder intelligence agent launched into an extended tirade denouncing Gysi for his attempts to 'Undermine German Socialism', closing his speech with praise for Stasi-aligned Premier Markus Wolf, who's legacy was fiercely denounced, or unjustly tarnished according to supporters, by the short-lived Gysi administration. As Berlin burns, it has become clear to international observers that Germany's brief attempts at democratization have been smuggled in the crib - something which has brought relief to some and dread to others."

Baier, who first led the unification of Austria with Germany in 1992, has been serving in a parallel office to [GER.GetLeader] in Austria for over a decade, however with an increase in pro-Separatist terrorist attacks in the region, Baier's continued rule has become further complicated. Today, during his attendance of an Opera in Vienna's Musikverein theater, Premier Baier was shot to death by a disguised assassin utilizing a concealed rifle designed to resemble a flute. While it is not clear who is responsible for Baier's death, rogue Stasi agents are suspected. Already expressions of grief have flooded in from across Germany as the long-serving Austrian leader's death throws the future of the volatile region into chaos once more. Succeeding Baier is H.C. Strache, a minor figure within the Austrian SED who's last-minute nomination over General Secretary Sebastian Kurz has shocked both Germany and Austria. Whether Strache can address the ever-present terrorist crisis which claimed the life of his predecessor, nobody can say."

The Stasi until had been hesitant to intervene in an effort to prevent news about their dire situation from releasing, however with little left to lose, [GER.GetLeader] has finally ordered units to enter Austria, surround Hofburg Palace, and kill Strache. On Strache's person was thousands of Rubles, several fake Passports, and a litany of loaded firearms, further fueling suspicions of foreign interference in Austria. With news about how dire the Austrian situation had become finally released to the world, many are beginning to wonder just how long German rule in Austria can hold on. While Moscow has fervently denied all allegations, many have come to believe that the Russians have begun to support Austrian terrorists as a means to prevent German usurpation of their status in the world. As Austria spirals out of control, newly-confirmed Premier Sebastian Kurz remains silent, refusing to rule out the dissolution of the 20-year long union between Austria and Germany and restoring Austrian independence."

Despite only being in his position for a handful of months, Strache has apparently made many enemies very quickly, as today, former General Secretary and newly-elevated Premier Sebastian Kurz, flanked by new General Secretary Mirko Messner, officially stated that Heinz Christian Strache was no longer Austria's Head of State within Germany while refusing to release further details. Already rumour has swirled about the true cause of Strache's 'Resignation', with explanations ranging from Corruption investigations, to involvement with Terrorism, to other more mundane ideological differences. The fact that Purges are remarkably uncommon within Germany compared to the USSR has made Strache's fall from power after such a short time all the more alarming. The recent surge in Austrian Terrorism has made some ponder if he was removed by Berlin due to unhappiness over his handling of the Separatist crisis - however others have offered the much more sinister explanation that Strache himself was a terrorist himself. It seems that we will never know the unabashed truth, as the SED will in all likelihood never tell."
