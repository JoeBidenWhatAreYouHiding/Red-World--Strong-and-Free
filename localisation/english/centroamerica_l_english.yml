 idea_CEA_unlimited_power:0 "Unlimited Power"
 idea_CEA_unlimited_power_desc:0 "Daniel Ortega’s grip over the Central America Union is harsh, brutal, and, as many would believe, unassailable. His influence over the party bureaucracy and the government has silenced the many foes who dared to speak out against his rule. Now, after the tumult of the early years of the Union, Ortega has finally established his power, and all opposition has been destroyed\n\nOr has it?"
 idea_CEA_incomplete_transition_1:0 "Incomplete Transition"
 idea_CEA_incomplete_transition_1_desc:0 "Despite being a socialist union of nations, many elements of capitalism can be still found throughout Central America, and all signs point to Daniel Ortega and other members of the political elites collaborating with the business elites of the region. Much of the population, from leftists desiring for actual socialism to ordinary people fed up with corruption, is dissatisfied by this slow pace of progress, and less can be said of Cuba, a fervently socialist nation who powered Ortega’s rise to power and the coming of the Union."

  idea_CEA_costa_rican_occupation:0 "Costa Rican Occupation"
 idea_CEA_costa_rican_occupation_desc:0 "During the contentious national elections of 2006 in Costa Rica, left-wing candidates swept the legislature, but a liberal candidate would win the presidency, triggering massive political chaos and an eventual military intervention from the Union. After some time under occupation, a referendum was held, and eventually Costa Rica was integrated into Central America. This election, however, is controversial with a large section of the Costa Rican populace, who believe it was rigged to favor integration and Central American interests."

CEA_father_of_democracy_desc:0 "Manuel Zelaya liberated the country from the grips of the tyrant Ortega and brought Democracy to the people of Centroamerica.

CEA_control_local_leaders_desc:0 "There are still a lot of regional administrators and politicians who are skeptical to support us and still awaiting the possibility of Ortega returning to power. Relieving the most uncooperative of their duties should be enough to bring the rest into the fold."

CEA_privatise_public_farmland_desc:0 "With the countryside being a stronghold for the FLNC, it is no surprise a lot of farmland is in the hands of the state. This monopoly over the countryside only served to squash independent farmers who did not agree with the government. To remedy this, all remaining public farmland will be distributed to private actors to bring fairness to the market."

CEA_depoliticise_education_desc:0 "Like most institutions in Centroamerica, the education system is filled to the brim with communist propaganda which seeks to paint the Sandinistas as virtuous heroes and downplay their crimes during the revolution. From now on, our students' education should be based on facts and not ideological fiction."
CEA_pacify_the_church:0 "Pacify the Church"
CEA_pacify_the_church_desc:0 "With Ortega gone, the Centroamerican Catholic Church has become emboldened and tried to reassert themselves more and more, partially thanks to parties like the United Opposition.

CEA_invite_the_canadians_desc:0 "Since the collapse of the United States in 1987, Canada has taken the mantle as the leader of the free world and a champion of the free market. If there is any country willing and capable of investing in Centroamerica, it is Canada."

CEA_legalise_abortion_desc:0 "While they claimed to be a progressive force, the conservative elements of the FLNC have treated women as second class citizens, restricting their access to abortion and other reproductive rights.

CEA_stand_against_communism_desc:0 "While the communists of the FLNC have been defeated for now, in the current international order there is no shortage of communists who wish to return us to the times of tyranny.

CEA_create_a_national_legend_desc:0 "Thanks to his incredible effort in bringing down the tyrant Ortega, Zelaya has become an almost universally beloved figure known simply as the ‘Father of Central American Democracy’. Such a widespread image should become more prevalent in the country, replacing the old cult of personality that surrounded Ortega."
CEA_promote_national_unity:0 "Promote National Unity"
CEA_promote_national_unity_desc:0 "Before, Centroamerica was united in the FLNC’s messages of revolution and anti-imperialism. As history has shown, many didn’t align with the message of the FLNC and a new raison d’etre for Centroamerica needs to be promoted. One enshrining freedom and democracy over revolutionary egalitarianism."

CEA_elevate_the_first_lady_desc:0 "The only person possibly capable of rivaling the popularity of President Zelaya is his wife and first lady, Xiomara Castro.

CEA_victory_of_the_anti_corruption_party_desc:0 " The people of Centroamerica has made their voices heard, and the voices are chanting for an end to corruption.

CEA_secular_governance_desc:0 "The Catholic Church, while an important institution in our country, is as susceptible to corruption as any other organization and should not be given special treatment.

CEA_open_doors_to_cuba_and_venezuela_desc:0 "Since the removal of Ortega, diplomatic relations with former partners like Cuba and Venezuela have significantly worsened.

CEA_keep_centralisation:0 "Return Centralisation"
CEA_keep_centralisation_desc:0 "Zelaya’s decision to federalize the country during democratizations was a big misstep, allowing regional administrations to subvert the efforts of the government and rule without necessary oversight.

CEA_privatise_coffee_and_fruit_desc:0 "One of Central America's greatest assets is the abundance of exotic produce like coffee and bananas. While the idea of Centroamerican produce being in the hands of private companies might be controversial due to, historic context, it’s the best way to bring Centroamerican plantations up to modern standards and give us an edge in the global food market."
CEA_presidential_propaganda:0 "Presidential Propaganda"
CEA_presidential_propaganda_desc:0 "Channel Nacional has proven to be a smash hit with the population, receiving hundreds of thousands regular watchers.

CEA_promote_urban_growth:0 "Promote Urban Growth"

CEA_hunt_down_the_corrupt_desc:0 "From low-level administrators to city mayors, a culture of corruption clings to the civil administration of our country.

CEA_introduce_anti_corruption_amendments_desc:0 "While it’s easy to target high profile figures with dramatic arrests and trials, it’s more difficult to attack the small cases of corruption perpetrated by low-level administrators.

CEA_invest_into_sports:0 "Invest Into Sports"
CEA_invest_into_sports_desc:0 "If there’s one thing the Centroamericans can’t get enough of, it’s sports. Under the Ortega regime there wasn’t a lot of room for the formation of independent teams, especially on the sub-regional level. We shall increase the funding towards smaller sports organizations, with the hope of fostering sport communities across the country."
CEA_new_military_contracts:0 "New Military Contracts"
CEA_new_military_contracts_desc:0 "A large portion of our arsenal consists of old Soviet equipment purchased during the revolution. If Centroamerica is to defend itself from foreign aggression, then we must establish a proper domestic arms industry.

CEA_return_of_the_revolutionary_majority_desc:0 "Despite losing its longtime leader and suffering an identity crisis, the FLNC has made a remarkable return to the halls of power.

CEA_renationalise_natural_resources:0 "Renationalise Natural Resources"
CEA_renationalise_natural_resources_desc:0 "One of Zelaya’s greatest mistakes was to privatize our national resources.

The resources of Centroamerica belong to its people, not to the wealthy."
CEA_deemphasise_revolution:0 "Deemphasise Revolution"
CEA_deemphasise_revolution_desc:0 "While the Sandinista Revolution was completely necessary to overthrow the Somoza dictatorship, that time has long passed.

CEA_twenty_first_century_socialism_desc:0 "We are over a decade into this new century, where socialism triumphed over the exploitative and repressive systems of old.

CEA_meet_with_indigenous_leaders:0 "Meet with Indigenous Leaders"
CEA_meet_with_indigenous_leaders_desc:0 "The indigenous community of Centroamerica has historically been the nation's most politically disadvantaged group, with their rights frequently ignored by the larger Latino population.

CEA_invest_in_social_spending:0 "Invest in Social Spending"
CEA_invest_in_social_spending_desc:0 "The government's primary function is to look after its citizens, especially when they are unable to properly take care of themselves. By increasing funding for public healthcare and healthcare benefits, we will uplift those most disadvantaged in society."
CEA_recreate_trade_unions:0 "Recreate Trade Unions"
CEA_recreate_trade_unions_desc:0 "Trade unions play an important role in guaranteeing that the average worker is paid fairly for his work. Under Ortega, independent trade unions were unnecessary since the state negotiated on their behalf. But in this new republic, the rights of the trade unions must be enshrined in law to prevent exploitation."
CEA_set_price_controls:0 "Set Price Controls"
CEA_set_price_controls_desc:0 "The free hand of the market is a little too free and susceptible to manipulations from conglomerates and elites. To prevent unreasonable pricing of necessary goods, the state will be the final arbitrator of value in Centroamerica"
CEA_start_cooperatives:0 "Start Cooperatives"
CEA_start_cooperatives_desc:0 "While private enterprises are legal within Centroamerica, there isn’t anything that says the state itself can compete in the market. By creating worker cooperatives that are properly owned and managed by their own workers, we will create a fairer and more stable competitor to private businesses."
CEA_create_a_significant_labour_force:0 "Create a Significant Labour Force"
CEA_create_a_significant_labour_force_desc:0 "Too many young and healthy citizens are stuck working low-wage jobs in the countryside or too inexperienced to work in the industries.

CEA_promote_schafiks_memory_desc:0 "Until his unfortunate passing in 2006, Schafik Handal was one of the loudest voices for reform within the FLNC, reconciliation with non-socialist countries, and the peaceful promotion of socialism. While he was taken from us too soon, there’s no doubt that he would be immensely proud of the great things we have been able to achieve"
CEA_the_costa_rican_situation:0 "The Costa Rican Situation"
CEA_the_costa_rican_situation_desc:0 "Since the intervention in 2006, Costa Rica has remained in political limbo. Too unruly to be properly integrated into Centroamerica and too symbolically important to pull out, the status quo has been carefully maintained with a continued occupation. Yet the situation in Costa Rica was always unsustainable, and with the occupation slowly falling apart, a course of action needs to be chosen soon"
CEA_end_the_occupation:0 "End the Occupation"
CEA_end_the_occupation_desc:0 "The occupation of Costa Rica has been nothing but a waste of military resources and human lives. Instead of doubling down on integrating a populace that does not want us there, we should concede defeat and preserve our little goodwill with Costa Rica"
CEA_hold_a_new_referendum:0 "Hold a New Referendum"
CEA_hold_a_new_referendum_desc:0 "All of our issues concerning Costa Rica can be tied back to the 2006 referendum. If the people of Costa Rica continue to question the legitimacy of the referendum, then perhaps a new one could solve this issue. By providing undeniable proof that a majority of the population prefers to be part of Centroamerica, we can finally delegitimize those who accuse us of being oppressive occupiers"

CEA_admit_to_the_rigging_desc:0 "The Costa Rican referendum remains the most controversial part of Centroamerica-Costa Rican relations.

By releasing previously classified documentation around the referendum, the truth will finally be accessible to the public, and we can correct this controversial part of our history"
CEA_rig_the_referendum:0 "Rig the Referendum"
CEA_rig_the_referendum_desc:0 "While we promised to listen to the voice of the people, only some things should be left in the hands of the uneducated masses.

CEA_campaign_honestly:0 "Campaign Honestly"
CEA_campaign_honestly_desc:0 "Our lack of legitimacy in the eyes of the Costa Ricans can be traced back to the belief that the previous referendum was rigged against them.

CEA_bribe_local_officials_desc:0 "Campaigning is simply a matter of knowing where and who to spend your resources on.

CEA_blast_pro_union_propaganda_desc:0 "There are so many great things that Costa Rica has received being part of Centroamerica, and so many more great things in the future should this union continue. The people of Costa Rica have been misled by years of anti-Centroamerican propaganda, so it’s only fair that we respond in kind with a more positive view of the situation."
CEA_promote_central_american_idealism:0 "Promote Central American Idealism"
CEA_promote_central_american_idealism_desc:0 "Centroamerica is more than just a physical nation, it is an idea. An idea that divided, the people of Central America are at the mercy of foreign oppression and military strongmen, but together, we can be so much more than the sum of our parts."
CEA_pre_stuff_ballots:0 "Pre-Stuff Ballots"
CEA_pre_stuff_ballots_desc:0 "While the predicted turnout for this referendum has been immense, the polling is not looking decisively in our favor. Maybe it wouldn’t hurt if a couple of pro-union votes were to arrive before the polling stations opened"
CEA_use_an_economic_argument:0 "Use an Economic Argument"
CEA_use_an_economic_argument_desc:0 "The most convincing argument is an economic argument. The fact of the matter is that Centroamerica’s economic capabilities dwarf that of Costa Rica alone, and by highlighting this fact through acts of charity, we can convince them of the economic benefits of staying."
CEA_open_relations_with_costa_rica:0 "Open Relations with Costa Rica"
CEA_open_relations_with_costa_rica_desc:0 "Since Costa Rica gained independence, relations between our two countries have been strained. Reopening diplomatic channels with Costa Rica is the only logical first step towards normalizing relations and beginning to mend our shared painful history."

CEA_request_free_access_for_returnees_desc:0 "During the hasty pullout from Costa Rica, some Centroamerican citizens were unfortunately left behind and now find themselves in a country without citizenship.

CEA_eliminate_mercenaries_desc:0 "The jungles of Costa Rica are plagued by American mercenaries that challenge our rule by training insurgents and committing terrorist acts.

CEA_copy_the_stasi_fbi_desc:0 "While the far-right Costa Rican nationalists placed their hope in the terrorists of the Alliance of Costa Rican Resistance, the moderate nationalists instead opposed our rule through critical articles, organized protests, and university clubs.

Filled with the eighty delegates from across the country, and the four Regional Administrators of the Republic, Ortega began by thanking those in attendance and at home for their dedication to the goals of the party, stating that it is their continued perseverance that has managed to maintain the unity of the state, the President pledged a renewed offensive against those who seek to divide the nation, with several delegates interrupting by denouncing the Costa Rican protestors and guerillas that occupy much of the region's countryside. Regaining control of the room, Ortega promised that the new decade would usher in an end to division and the completion of the Central American Revolution. Met with applause Ortega continued his speech by proclaiming that the vestiges of capitalism would be tamed, recognizing that the grip of the bourgeoisie had long strangled the workers but defended his record of working with selected businesses as a measure to ensure economic stability.

Although the exact severity of the hurricane was uncertain, local authorities have wasted no time taking the report to mean a worst-case scenario is on the horizon, with police now urging the public to remain calm and prepare by standard hurricane procedures. Thanks to the efforts of our police the situation has largely been maintained as families across the nation have begun to pack their bags and prepare for the inevitable arrival of the yet-unnamed hurricane. Although the Republic has seen its fair share of hurricanes and tropical storms over the years, this has not stopped the President from taking the matter seriously who has now assembled his cabinet along with various other advisors to discuss the reports and the potential responses once more information becomes available.

centroamerica.3.d:0 "In response to the impending hurricane, President Ortega has now called for another meeting of his cabinet along with several high-ranking experts and trusted individuals, members of the Politburo, and military officials, to formulate a comprehensive plan of action to address the incoming Hurricane Carlos. During the lengthy discussion, it was agreed that the National Guard should be deployed to assist in the evacuation of people in vulnerable cities, with the effort being to relocate residents to safer areas. Though the plan was deemed feasible, with this being the same response to all hurricanes in the past, Vice President Murillo suggested that an evacuation will do little more than force the government to deal with a surge of internally displaced people leading to further costs for the state that it may not be able to afford. As a result, the Vice President offered a second opinion, stating that the state should allocate state resources towards rapidly constructing levees and flood barriers that will fortify existing infrastructure and minimize the damage caused by Carlos. Although both sound solutions, the President can only allocate enough of the budget towards the funding of one solution and as a result, the meeting carried on well into the night with both the military and Vice President hoping to have their voices heard."

Though the meetings held by President Ortega have been somewhat effective in establishing a solid defense for the nation, with reports from the affected cities stating that the preparation over the past few days has seemingly minimized the loss of life, it will be impossible to assess the damage until the storm has cleared. With the nation on high alert, and the news broadcasting a twenty-four-hour service detailing how to minimize the storm's impact on their homes, and where aid stations shall be established, the President is expected to make an announcement that will deal with the fears of the nation and assure them that together they can weather the storm. Unfortunately, such calls for comradery have not been heeded by all with reports of looting skyrocketing across the affected areas. Powerless to stop these criminals, the police have issued a statement promising that the full force of the law will be laid down once the storm has passed. For now, all that can be done is to wait and hope the President’s plan made enough of a difference."

Despite the destructive force of Hurricane Carlos, it is with great relief that the President was able to report to the people that the strength of the hurricane had begun to dissipate with it expected that Carlos would disappear entirely once it passes over Yucatan Province in Mexico. Whilst this news has been well received, this information can do little to aid the millions of people now affected by the storm as Tegucigalpa now suffers from catastrophic damage. In response to the damage, Mayor Zelaya has issued a statement promising immediate economic aid and the arrival of police forces to deal with reports of looting and to facilitate the ongoing rescue efforts. As the news maintains its constant twenty-four-hour cycle of emergency broadcasts the President continues to be informed of the effects the storm has had on the Republic, with an estimated seven thousand dead and damages now exceeding three billion rubles.

With the nation in chaos, the government has begun to face harsh criticism from the people on the ground with many local chapters of the FLNC questioning why President Ortega would choose to abandon tried and tested procedures for hurricanes and instead try to defend the nation from an act of God. Some have even begun to privately suggest the reason for this decision is due to the President and Vice President being married. Downplaying the public outcry, the President has shifted the blame onto meteorologists claiming their advice demonstrated a need to shift towards the construction of flood defenses, yet sources have proven that the President knew for weeks in advance that Carlos was a category four hurricane, making the shift unsuccessful."

Unexpectedly, this desperation has now broken through into organized relief efforts as during a scheduled food handout in Managua, in which loaves of bread, and liters of water were distributed to the people, a violent skirmish occurred between a starving group of thirteen who had supposedly been missed out for their rations and the police delivering the food. Though this situation was contained, the ability of those arrested to briefly challenge the police has now unfortunately inspired others across the capital to engage in violent behavior in the hopes of securing more food for themselves and their families. With cars and buildings aflame, local riot police have assured the President they have the situation entirely under control, yet with over two hundred arrested and many more hospitalized it is evident the police have overestimated their capabilities with Ortega contemplating deploying the military to restore law and order."

However, with the police having been on high alert since the onset of the food riots in Managua, disaster has now befallen Tegucigalpa as one trigger-happy officer deemed the approaching crowd to be a threat to his safety and opened fire on the crowd injuring three individuals. Hearing the shots, protestors were quick to flee the scene though some refused to leave and charged the officer responsible for the injuries. In retaliation, a further five police officers discharged their weapons, wounding a further ten and killing four.

Although Montenegro survived the assassination attempt, with her assailant quickly being apprehended, the fact that a Regional Administrator was so easily targeted, despite being surrounded by security personnel demonstrates how quickly the opposition has become radicalized and how dangerous the streets of Centroamerica have become. Rushed to Hospital Vivian Pellas, where she received flowers from various allies within the FLNC and a direct meeting with President Ortega who she was to meet with, Montenegro is expected to make a full recovery. In retaliation to this assassination attempt, President Ortega has now placed Managua under martial law, stating that if the protestors do not relent, this order will be enacted across the nation.

The most prolific of the seven that have chosen to abandon their posts at this dire time for the Republic is foreign minister Samuel Santos López. As a result, with President Ortega struggling to find a suitable replacement for López, the risk of the government collapsing from internal factors rather than from widespread rioting has become a legitimate concern, prompting the President to instigate tighter controls over who is appointed to which positions. Whether this further centralization of powers around Ortega will work is still unknown, as the nation has viewed this expansion of power as a clear indication that the President is preparing to instigate an autocoup in the hopes of maintaining his role."

However, whilst the President had expected the support of the Politburo in his plans to rekindle the alliance between the people and the FLNC, reports have now circulated that many of Ortega’s allies have begun to turn against him with the Politburo issuing demands of their own. The specifics of these ultimatums are entirely unknown, with the record of the meeting sealed and its attendants refusing to acknowledge the meeting took place, and rejecting commenting on the matter to the press. Naturally, this silence has spread wild rumors across the country, with some believing that decentralization is imminent, whilst others see this as confirmation that more resignations are forthcoming.

Citing his desire to hand the nation over to the next generation, the Republic has seemingly been brought into a collective jubilation as this announcement has signaled the anticipation of the ushering in of democratic reform and the prospect of decentralization. However, with no clear line of succession, this celebration may be premature given that it is more than likely that Ortega’s successor will be hand-picked to ensure he can maintain control over the country.

Over twenty-four hours, thirty opposition figures have been arrested by the National Police, all on charges of corruption and treason. Although some had hoped the arrests would not spread to loyal members of the FLNC, this hope was shattered as Mayor Rodolfo Sunseri was apprehended on the charge of counter-revolutionary activity. Word of this high-profile arrest has now spread across the nation, with citizens of all former protest movements now uniting under an anti-Ortega banner demanding the immediate release of those arrested. With crackdowns initiated in response to these protests and San Pedro Sula placed on lockdown, the promises made by Ortega at his resignation speech now lay broken as it is clear that the President is doing all he can to ensure that he remains in control regardless of whether he or someone else occupies the Presidential House."

Regardless of this clear division gripping the nation over the announcement, the Republic is largely pleased with the fact that Ortega will no longer be able to directly control the FLNC’s politics hoping that Zelaya will be more lenient and continue to usher in political reform. However, Zelaya has seemingly put a halt on these hopes instead focusing his acceptance speech entirely upon the need for economic reform and the unity of the state under the policies of the FLNC further emphasizing the belief he will be a direct continuation of Ortega.

Despite these protests, the FLNC has returned to both the Presidential House and ParlaCen with clear aims to continue the policies of ex-President Daniel Ortega. In his inaugural address to the nation, which was broadcast across the Republic, President Zelaya confirmed these rumors stating that whilst he is his own man, he could not abandon the incredibly successful policies of the FLNC and that the only changes he desires to make is a small shakeup of the cabinet.

Having been imprisoned in the Penitencieria Nacional de San Pedro Sula since the announcement of President Ortega’s resignation, former Mayor Rodolfo Sunseri has now been released, granted immediate pardon, and appointed to the position of Minister for National Security. Despite claims that the former mayor is woefully underqualified for such a role, with ParlaCen demanding his immediate resignation, President Zelaya has remarked that the appointment will not be reversed and that the FLNC can learn much from the renowned autonomist.

Going further, Ortega suggested that the President's main goal was to undo the revolution, destroy the Republic, and begin embracing the capitalist policies of the American Republic. Having seemingly gained the backing of a majority of ParlaCen on the matter, Ortega now stands in a powerful position to initiate a direct challenge against the recently elected President, either having him replaced by a more loyal minister or returning to office himself despite the public's continued hostility towards him.

Citing numerous examples of Ortega’s abuse of power, stating he intentionally sided with his wife in meetings regarding Hurricane Carlos to appease her, the most damning statement came when the President revealed that the recent election was rigged entirely in favor of the FLNC. Although not surprising, with the crackdowns against oppositional figures and the lack of choice on the presidential ballot, having this confirmed by Zelaya has turned even the most ardent Ortega supporters left in society against him. Whilst complicit in the crimes, the President assured the populace that he had no knowledge of plans for the mass arrest of political opponents and only accepted the candidacy knowing that he would be able to instigate the potential for change in the Republic.

Nowhere has seen more support for the President than his home region of Honduras, as the populace there has openly called for the arrest of Daniel Ortega and his wife. With the police powerless to stop these nationwide protests, Ortega’s recent slander has seemingly failed as the Republic begins to accept Zelaya for what he truly is, a democratic reformer. However, although the public may support the President, it is clear that a majority of members of ParlaCen, the Politburo, and most worryingly, the military are still opposed to Zelaya making any attempts to pass legislation near impossible.

It has not taken much deciphering of these reports to realize that Ortega plans to instigate a coup and restore himself as President and General Secretary of the FLNC. However, given the lack of information surrounding who Ortega has been meeting with, the information contained within these reports cannot be fully verified.

Recognizing that the Politburo may desire to intervene with ParlaCens proposals for reform, Zelaya has pledged to sign what is agreed upon through an executive order bypassing the potential for deadlock and ensuring democracy can begin to flourish. With all thirty-eight delegates of ParlaCen gathering, including moderates of the FLNC such as Mauricio Funes, President Zelaya has now decreed the beginning of a constitutional convention. While much of the convention has kept the framework of the state the same, notable changes have now been forced through the legislature thanks to executive orders 0721, 0722, and 0723. To increase the legitimacy of ParlaCen and its capabilities at scrutinizing legislation, 0721 has now removed the right of the regional administrators ability to sit as representatives in the legislature. Likewise, 0722 has taken this a step further and has reorganized the mayors into a cleaner structure, reducing their numbers from five-hundred and seventy-nine to fifty-four, basing them off of the total number of departments rather than municipalities, and ensuring that all regional administrations, no matter their size, become elected officials. Finally, 0723, the most controversial, has removed the role of the FLNC as the vanguard of the Republic, legalizing opposition from all corners of the nation. Taking advantage of this fact, Zelaya has now announced his resignation as a member of the FLNC and has been admitted as the leader of an underground democratic movement called Civic Action, following a short and unanimous vote within the party."

Regardless of which, Ortega is outraged over this immense blunder, with the President reprimanding generals about the potential leak of their meetings. Although the plot has now succeeded, with the lack of information surrounding who the President was meeting with seemingly being the only saving grace for the coup, the leak clearly sent Zelaya into a paranoid frenzy, prompting his cowardice and evacuation.

Gaining the reaction he had hoped for, several protests arose across all provincial capitals demanding the resignation of Ortega and the imposition of democracy. These mass demonstrations have now allowed the President to weaken Zelaya’s support base as arrests across the country have now taken place, with some prisons reaching three hundred percent capacity in light of the crackdown.

Shortly after the speech concluded the now independent Honduran military began a nationwide campaign to expel the remnants of Ortega’s military.

Although secession is illegal, as stated in the constitution, it appears as though the military has lost all ambition to reclaim the region, seeing it as the final nail in the coffin for the Republic. Unable to muster a response to this announcement President Murillo has reportedly locked herself within her chambers in the Presidential House unable to cope with the loss of both her husband and the Republic. Although supposedly preparing to address the nation, the cabinet has now taken over responsibilities for the handling of day-to-day activities until Murillo is capable of returning to her duties. While the people of the Republic of El Salvador may celebrate their independence, it is clear that President Cerén resents the collapse of the Republic seeing El Salvador’s independence as the only way to ensure internal stability."

Although the remnants of ParlaCen have denounced this decision, believing that the revolution fought for by Ortega cannot easily be forgotten, the President insisted that it would not be her husband's desire to see his life work cling to life as a state reduced to the Republic of Nicaragua. Announcing the abolition of ParlaCen, Murillo decreed that the new Republic would strive towards the maintenance of Sandinismo in Nicaragua alone.

Despite our fraternal bond with Central America, granting them such a request may prove more difficult than originally assumed.

Although Foreign Minister López had attempted to secure further resources from the Cuban government, allegedly engaging in hours of debate with his Cuban counterparts and President [CUB.Getleader], in which he sought clarification on why a larger aid package could not be sent, it appears that we are being told by the Republic to be satisfied with what they have offered citing terrorist action as the main reason why their aid is presently limited."

Whilst the Foreign Minister has assured our government that the money will be spent on rebuilding major urban centers, infrastructure, and flood reversal projects, the initial refusal to state where this money would be spent has remained a clear issue for [GER.Getleader] who does not wish such a large aid package to be sent if our socialist allies cannot be honest about its allocation, especially when this money could be used to further combat the rising tide of Westalgie.

In their response, the General Secretary requested that we think nothing of it and utilize this aid as best we can to secure the continuation of Central American prosperity. This gesture has resonated well with the populace, who are now praising Berlin for its swift action, demonstrating that even in our darkest hours international solidarity remains as strong as ever.

With this rejection, the people of our Republic are left to grapple with the aftermath of Hurricane Carlos alone, finding themselves unable to navigate the physical challenges of reconstruction given the lack of proper equipment and funding.

Acknowledging these collective efforts, President Ortega also announced the total success of the Ortega Plan, attributing the positive strides in recovery to the strategic initiatives outlined in the plan.

Fortunately, these confrontations did not result in any casualties, but the images of battered and bloodied youth circulated widely, casting a dark shadow over the government’s reputation and raising suspicions that President Ortega might have played a role in instigating the brutal crackdown.

Yet, to the surprise of many, the motion garnered the support of a narrow majority of FLNC members who had grown disillusioned with President Ortega’s handling of the recent student protests. As a result, much to the shock of the President and the Politburo, the motion passed and the government has now begun preparations to advance to the next stage of the political process; selecting a new president.

Although no stranger to abusing his authority, as seen with the preemptive arrest of Ortega on faulty evidence, this case is seemingly different for the President as he hopes to reform his image and demonstrate that his continued leadership will not be defined by undemocratic actions during this tumultuous period.

The most significant change of the Centroamerican constitution was the administrative shape of the Union, transforming the previously unitary republic into a federal state. With this radical change, Ortega’s legacy has now been entirely demolished as all political offices require direct elections from the people, the mayors are stripped of their regional importance to be replaced by more effective Regional Governors, and the intentionally restrictive vetting process done away with.

Now with the Constitutional Convention concluding and the laws of the land reforged to suit the new federal Republic, election day has finally arrived. With a polarized campaign plaguing the nation, as critics of the President’s recent authoritarian policies clash with his supporters, the imagined two-way race between Civic Action and the United Opposition has seemingly broadened as Salvador Nasralla and Mauricio Funes have steadily crept through the woodworks, forcing the election into a four-way battle. Despite hopes for a landslide victory by the President, Civic Action has now been forced into a lengthy campaign to defend Zelaya’s record and fight against the accusation asserted by Nasralla that he benefitted, monetarily, from the FLNC’s corruption. Similarly, Funes and the FLNC remain fighting an uphill battle to demonstrate that the party has turned over a new leaf, one free of Ortega’s totalitarian policies, and hoping to demonstrate that despite claims by Hernández, they remain committed to religious freedom. With turnout exceeding seventy-five percent, there can only be one winner in the first elections of the new Republic."

Inspired by the perceived weakness of the government, seemingly believing the recent motion of no-confidence was enough to divide the government, President [CEA.Getleader] has now been forced to turn his attention towards the unstable province, as thousands of demonstrators affiliated with the pro-independence movement have gathered in the streets demanding the removal of so-called occupation forces and the release of political prisoners. With no orders heard from Managua, supposedly due to the government's continued reorganization, the commander of the peacekeeping forces opted to quell the protests, triggering the onset of violence and resulting in numerous injuries and fatalities. Recognizing the fragility of the situation, the FLNC has now returned to a somewhat united front as the government has begun to debate its response. Hoping to ease tensions, the commander of the Costa Rican peacekeepers has now been dismissed, however, this dismissal has done little to address the demands of the protestors who continue to demand their freedoms."

Returning to San José, the President has now met with Walter Muñoz Céspedes, the President of the Costa Rican Provisional Government, to sign a declaration of friendship, renouncing all claims the Republic holds over the region and the declaration of Costa Rican independence. In a subsequent press conference, President Céspedes declared his desire to ensure the continuation of strong relations between Managua and San José, remarking that none of this would have been possible without the President’s willingness to undo the wrongs of the past. Accepting this praise with gratitude and sincerity, President [CEA.Getleader] promised that the days of violence were behind them, and gifted Céspedes a bundle of sacuanjoche, izotes, and orchids signifying the continued bond of Centroamerica by recognizing Costa Rica’s desire and right to bloom on its own. As celebrations continue across Costa Rica, the President has now been granted a brief respite, allowing them to continue to develop the nation and finally begin charting a new course for Centroamerica."

Despite accusations of fraud by fringe elements within Costa Rica, who have bitterly clung to the idea that the government cannot fairly organize a referendum on the future of the Costa Rican people, internal observers have claimed that the referendum is free of any corrupt practices and that the turnout of over eight-nine percent is legitimate. With crowds of people gathering in San José to hear the announcement live, the President has already begun to draft legislation facilitating Costa Rica’s immediate secession should the vote go in favor of independence. Although remaining off of the campaign trail to ensure a sake of balance and retain neutrality regardless of the outcome, much of the President’s cabinet and Representatives in ParlaCen have taken to campaigning openly for the continued unity of the people of Central America.

Although congratulations have been given to the now-President Walter Muñoz Céspedes, there has been a vocal minority within the cabinet proclaiming that if the President deemed it correct, they could refuse to allow the referendum to pass, and declare it illegal. While this would go against months of hard work and potentially run the risk of reigniting the flames of Costa Rican terrorism, secession from Managua is still technically outlawed, as stipulated within the Union Treaty. Though an exception has been granted for this once-in-a-lifetime referendum, the vocal minority has not spoken of committing any action that cannot be legally justified. However, following such a course of action would undoubtedly lead to more problems than it would be worth. Yet, even so, the temptation to ensure the Republic remains intact is powerful and all President [CEA.Getleader] has to do is remind ParlaCen that secession remains illegal."

Despite running an effective opposition campaign, with the memories of the harsh occupation policies being brought to the forefront of the debate, the potential for an economic catastrophe following independence was enough to convince numerous undecideds into supporting the status quo. Unfortunately, whilst this result has satisfied ParlaCen and those who voted in favor of remaining, the results have failed to satisfy Costa Rican nationalists who have already begun campaigning for a third referendum arguing that the close vote and precedent set with this election gives them the right to demand Managua hold another vote. Though such demands have been refuted by ParlaCen, who has already deemed the referendum a once in a generation decision, this has not stopped demands from San José from growing louder, forcing the President to continue focusing their attention on the region until the status quo prevails and Central American unity is assured."

As expected, this has led to outrage across Costa Rica and the nation, as for the second time in our nation's history, we have denied the right of the Costa Rican people to have a legitimate say over their participation within the Union. Maintaining plausible deniability, the President has ordered the people to cease their violent protests until a proper investigation into the matter can be authorized, however, such orders have fallen on deaf ears as Costa Rica has risen in arms against our rule, establishing a provisional government and preparing for immediate secession without a referendum. As the army begins its mobilization, awaiting the onset of the Costa Rican’s independence declaration, the President has been faced with a difficult situation. Either grant Costa Rica its long desired independence, and avoid further bloodshed, or allow the army to mobilize in the hopes of keeping the Republic united."

Our brave soldiers, under the command of our superior military leadership, have failed to advance beyond initial contact lines with formidable resistance from seasoned Costa Rican guerillas, resulting in a protracted and stagnant frontline. With little movement at the front and the realization that this war is being fought to secure the results of a rigged election, citizens of the Republic have begun to protest the continuation of the war, gathering in Managua for the last few weeks. Realizing the severity of the situation and facing immense opposition within ParlaCen, President [CEA.Getleader] has now agreed to pull out from the region, ending the war and ensuring peace once more. While his decision deals a devastating blow to national prestige and runs the risk of continued aggression by Costa Rican forces until an official peace can be signed, it appears to be the only viable option for salvaging what remains of the Republic."

This regional bloc supposedly aims to foster Latin American and Caribbean unity, undermining any attempts by subversive elements and capitalist forces to destroy the hard-fought efforts of revolutionaries across the region. Officially only a political union for now, Managua has expressed keen interest in advancing the SSF further should its members be willing, arguing the case for joint-military cooperation and a formal alliance shortly. Although joining such an organization would aid in our protection from the threats of capitalism and foster relations with our socialist allies we have desired for decades, there can be no mistake that Managua would dominate the economic, political, and military ambitions of this new organization with our wishes sacrificed in the hopes of advancing the Central American Revolution.

Officially titled the Council of Economic Advisors of the San Salvador Forum, the new Council aims to finally break down trade barriers, establish a clear consensus on economic planning, and deliver to the people the necessities required in life. With debate arising within the San Salvador Forum over the differing styles of economic planning, it was ultimately agreed that the most effective model would be adapted, with COMECON becoming a baseline for future economic development. With the SSF Council having agreed to this matter, the only remaining matter is for our representatives to ratify our commitment to the Economic Council and while many are eager to participate, there is a lingering question of the necessity of this project. Trade has already been expanded across the Caribbean and Latin America, and the SSF Economic Council does little more than add further red tape that we could easily avoid should we merely refuse to sign up for the economic program."

Although only proposing a standardized training regimen, it is evident that these are the first steps toward the formation of a military alliance. While we desire protection from capitalism, the question of sovereignty over our military has now been brought into question, with acceptance of this newly ratified agreement being viewed as a betrayal by the armed forces who wish to continue their efforts to expand and modernize our forces on their own. Yet, with the effectiveness of the Central American military having been shown time and time again, there cannot be any doubt that we have a great deal to learn about the modern art of war, and we should only refuse if we are certain of our combat capabilities."

Despite there being concerns that accepting the invitation to this alliance would only further exacerbate tensions with surrounding capitalist states, the Council has assured member states that this alliance will only act in defense against capitalism and work instead to facilitate the expansion of the SSF through peaceful means. Though there seem to be few detractors to accepting the invitation to this alliance, concerns continue to permeate the government over the obligations of the alliance, with the SSF requiring the reallocation of three percent of GDP towards the military. With such a sizable requirement, many believe we would be unable to afford membership despite promises that exceptions can be made depending on the economic situation of member states. Our government now sits at a crossroads, with denying this invitation being a betrayal of the long-awaited unity of the Caribbean and Latin American proletariat, yet accepting seemingly damning the very people we are supposedly fighting to protect into potential financial ruin."

Initially proposed in the waning month of 2009, the Development Treaty would see our two nations pool our resources together, with Managua benefiting from mimicking our oil refinery projects and us, in turn, gaining access to their impressive industrial capabilities, allowing for the Republic to continue its path of economic revitalization. Although there is little reason why we would refuse this offer, with the project having been placed on hiatus for several years already, questions have now begun to be raised about the necessity of this project, given the improvement of the economy over the last few years. In 2009, this Development Project was viewed as an absolute necessity by the National Assembly, President [CUB.Getleader] has begun to see the arguments against the Project, believing that signing up for the deal would benefit neither Managua nor Havana. Even if this may be the case, for the sake of collaboration, it may be better to sign up to the agreement and reap the benefits of the deal regardless of whether our economy truly needs it."

Likewise, the Cuban government has already accepted a small detachment of our construction experts who will work to oversee the building of both civilian and military industries for the Republic. To sweeten the deal and to ensure that neither Managua nor Havana is paying an excessive amount for the cost of these projects, it has now been added to the Treaty that our two governments will pool our resources together, creating a joint funding pot, with both our nations already placing a sizeable amount into to allow projects to begin almost instantaneously. As the hope for a grand reawakening of Cuban and Centroamerican industry now seemingly dawns, the President now seeks to expand upon this agreement, realizing that the future of the Caribbean will be guided by the two revolutionary titans of the region."

Explaining clearly that the needs of Havana and Managua are the same, with Cuba still in dire need of our industrial advisors and the Republic desperately needing the means to expand our synthetic refinery capabilities, the answer remained the same, with Cuba seemingly confident that the Treaty would do little to aid our nation's economic development. With the Cubans refusing to budge on the matter, even as our ambassadors attempted to utilize the ongoing conflict across the world as justification for our economic unity, the President has now been forced to accept the reality of the situation and abandon any attempts to have the Havana-Managua Development Treaty become an official piece of legislation.

While there has been little opposition to this proposal, with our officers ready and willing to return to Central America to help guide their Revolution forward, there have been brief concerns among some officers who believe that their return could weaken the position of the armed forces given the continued rise in tensions across the Caribbean.

Having been rightly informed that by strengthening our armed forces, Havana would be less likely to fall to enemy subversion, these generals have now arrived prepared to train our armies in the necessary skills needed to carry out an effective guerilla campaign. Although some have questioned the necessity of these tactics, it is unlikely that the Republic will come under occupation, President [CEA.Getleader] has insisted that with the eyes of the reactionaries everywhere, it cannot be completely ruled out that at some point, the revolution may have to resort to these successful tactics to survive."

Although these concerns are valid, with the recent wave of terrorism in Cuba demonstrating the legitimacy of their refusal, it has not made their rejection any easier to accept. It had been assumed that Cuba would have realized that through the strengthening of our Republic’s armed forces, their position would have been solidified due to continued cooperation between our militaries. As a result of Cuba’s refusal to dispatch their officers, the President has now authorized our generals to begin developing a new training regiment for our ground forces, in an attempt to replicate the successes of Cuban guerilla warfare.

This, as a principle, sounds like an incredibly beneficial agreement, as Cuban socialism and Central American socialism have been known to differ in their approach to certain aspects of political doctrine. Having these students learn from their comrades abroad would strengthen our alliances and help maintain relations in the future. However, it is because of this exact reason that there have been objections to the Dalton Program. President [CEA.Getleader] does not agree wholeheartedly with [CUB.Getleader] while they both believe in the ultimate end goal of communism, there are evident differences, and we would not wish either our or Managua’s students to become confused with political doctrine or gain the wrong impression of socialism."

While there was initial resistance to the plan by the Cuban government, who believed that the transfer of students between Havana and Managua would ultimately lead to complicated ideological disputes between more focused and dedicated students, these beliefs were ultimately shattered as our governments were able to reconcile that these petty disagreements matter little in the face of education and that every good student is more than capable of disagreeing with their peers. As the first flights now begin to be packed, and the students of our nation eagerly await the tropical paradise of Havana, the confirmation of the Dalton Program stands as an ever-lasting reminder that even ideology cannot keep Cuba and the Republic apart."

Despite our objections to their refusal, claiming that something as simple as the disagreement of students' ideas should not be reason enough to cancel the Dalton Program, the Cuban government has refused to entertain the idea further, claiming that the last thing needed at the moment is a large group of ideologically driven students coming to Havana and potentially stirring up trouble. With it now entirely unlikely that Cuba will wish to revisit this program in the future, President [CEA.Getleader] has already turned their attention inwards, abandoning the idea of a student exchange program and pledging to reshuffle funding to strengthen the Republic’s universities by hiring more qualified teachers counterbalancing the loss of Havana's acclaimed institutions."

With relations with Central America having been cut off since their invasion of Costa Rica, the resurgence of a more forgiving and lenient government has allowed for the easing of this halt in relations, opening the doors to the proposal they have handed over today. Although not a lengthy document, with Managua simply wishing to purchase some of our oil to facilitate their continued investments into their growing oil sector, it is what this document represents that has brought pause to our representative's meeting with their ambassadors. Should we accept this request, Central America will likely take our acceptance as an end to our diplomatic freeze and the beginning of a new era of warm relations. While we are not opposed to this in theory, some in parliament argue that Central America has yet to prove it has advanced beyond the politics of its predecessors, bar this one instance of friendly relations with us."

With the inking of the document, the long-awaited end to our diplomatic pause has now ended, with it evident that Mexico is willing to begin anew and accept that our new government has advanced well beyond the practices of our predecessors. As a result of this, several Mexican companies have already expressed keen interest in expanding their businesses south to capitalize on the newly opened markets that were previously closed off to them. With no reason to deny their entry, it is expected that Mexican companies will soon begin to establish themselves across the Republic over the coming months. Likewise, oil has now begun to flow from Mexico into the Republic, representing a dramatic shift in our relations, and, to sweeten our deal, Mexico has offered us advice in expanding our growing synthetic oil industries. The Mexican acceptance of this deal has not only done our economy a great service, with our openness to our neighbor already proving to be more beneficial than economists had predicted, but it has also revealed to the rest of Latin America that Managua is and always will be from now on, open for business."

Naturally frustrated at this development, the President has lamented that the Mexican refusal has damned Central America to continued isolation from its neighbors as this scathing denunciation has ensured that the diplomatic pause still maintained with Mexico will continue well into the future. If we are to change our neighbors minds, it is evident we shall have to continue to wait to be accepted by our northern friends, despite the people having already demonstrated we are willing to embrace this change at a rapid pace. With economists now panicking, fearing the negative impacts of this refusal, it is also expected that our oil industries will continue to falter and fall behind the rest of the world, unable to catch up unless serious investments are made from Managua itself."

Officially titled the Association of Caribbean States, the President has made the regional organization's goal known, the defence of Caribbean democracy from all foreign meddling, a joint international front within the United Nations, and significant development for our economies through a joint-tourism fund. While all this sounds promising, with the ACS mimicking the successes of other regional blocs across the globe, there will naturally come a clear cost to this organization, with politicians already eager to point out that the cost of our membership outweighs the benefits should this organization fail to attract enough members from across the Caribbean. Similar arguments have continued to permeate the halls of government as the matter of sovereignty continues to be brought up against our ascension. However, despite the drawbacks, is it not finally time for the governments of the Caribbean to join together to work for the betterment of their people?"

With the Committee having voted in favor of the amendments unanimously, the only obstacle remaining to our following of these new regulations is our ambassador's signature. While there are few reasons to reject the Committees recommendations, some of our ambassadors have rejected the principles of developing international investments seeing it as the beginnings of a loss of economic independence should states such as Canada, Mexico or Brazil begin to invest. While the Committee has ensured that it would protect its member states from economic imperialism the reality of the fact is that doing so would be harder than the Committee is willing to admit, with it likely that we would end up at the beck and call of one of the major economic world powers."

However, Managua and several others have grown increasingly concerned over the lack of regulations surrounding tourism. Specifically, the Special Committee has argued that the lack of environmental regulations for tourists can harm our member states' ecology and the ecosystems of popular tourist destinations. To prevent this from occurring, the Committee has proposed enforcing strict regulations on international flights and raising prices for transportation and lodgings to ensure that the Caribbean does not become a haven of obscene leisure holidays. Likewise, this increase will allow our industries to properly scale their prices based on the demand for holidays and tours to certain areas. While this would protect the environment and ensure that our island paradise is not ruined by thousands of unappreciative tourists, this would severely impact our immediate income from tourism, with our representatives to the Association concerned about the implications these decisions will have for our economy."

The horrors of Hurricane Carlos have shown that without adequate protection, Mother Nature will destroy lives, homes, and vital infrastructure. With the Caribbean a regular target for hurricanes and tropical storms, the Special Committee has proposed that all member states sign up for an additional investment fund that would be used by any member state in the event of a natural disaster. Specifically, this funding would be taken out of a portion of our GDP and could only be accessed if states provided evidence it would be used to construct risk reduction infrastructure such as flood barriers and storm shelters. While this idea has been discussed before, with many believing it necessary, the proposal has been met with some backlash, specifically, the amount of bureaucracy this will cause and how this would potentially impact our response to an imminent threat. As a result, there are some requesting that we abstain from signing up for this relief fund to ensure the safety of our civilians and avoid unnecessary bureaucracy."

While initially deemed a radical proposal to many, the heightened tensions across the world have now made such a proposal necessary with the eyes of imperialists eyeing up our region as a tool to be used against their foes. Specifically, the Agenda proposes that the member states would prioritize the reduction of foreign warships within our seas, using force to disperse them if necessary. While the presence of certain vessels is unavoidable, the Council has argued that the presence of carriers and other large battleships in large numbers cannot be justified and that the alliance would focus on close cooperation to remove fleets from our surrounding areas. While a necessary endeavor in theory, many have questioned how the Caribbean states would be able to mount any resistance to the seemingly endless size of the American, European, or Canadian fleets. Despite this, many have accepted the necessity for some kind of alliance across the Caribbean regardless of whether it would be able to safely defend our waters from foreign threats."

As demonstrated with the arrival of this Centroamerican Legion which, despite its small size, has demonstrated a fierce and unwavering commitment to the restoration of the United States, it appears as though the days of hostility between our nations have finally come to an end. Having integrated this battalion into our armed forces, with the military high command able to coordinate their deployment despite the language barrier, [USA.GetLeader] has now personally thanked President [CEA.GetLeader] hoping to continue to expand cooperation with Central America and ward off the eyes of the communist world who remain eager to reinstall Daniel Ortega to the Presidential House."

However, such a blanket and immediate reaction may have worrying consequences for the future. Although our military intervention in Yemen in 2002 eventually resulted in our success and the pushback of the communists, it was not without immense strain on the economy and the public. By pledging to protect a nation once more from all threats, potentially dragging our armed forces into a conflict hundreds of miles away, we risk once more repeating the mistakes of the past and damning our nation to further economic decline. However, unlike Yemen, Central America can easily be reached by our naval and air forces, with our high command arguing that any strike made against our potential allies would be swift, precise, and minimal in cost."

Despite their eagerness and willingness to pledge the required GDP expenditure on defense, the only consideration halting our immediate acceptance is the military capabilities of our potential new ally. Although an effective fighting force, the Central American military is years behind our military in terms of training and technological capabilities, meaning their entry would see the diversion of advisors to ensure the gates to Latin America are properly protected. However, regardless of this lack of military preparedness, control over the gates to North and Latin America would ensure our interests in the region are protected and bring a halt to any potential expansion by communist or other hostile forces. Eagerly anticipating our response, the Central American representatives await with bated breath the decision of our government, hoping that we shall allow them to join the side of righteousness and work to build a future free for all."

However, while the majority of government and the nation celebrate our achievement, opposition to our ascension has continued to exist within the fringe camps of the radical FLNC and the vestiges of Ortega loyalists who claim our entry represents the final victory of capitalism over the Republic, the fall of our independence to Ottawa, and our willing participation a war against the international proletariat. Though these voices will continue to be a nuisance for the foreseeable future, their voices have been almost entirely drowned out by President [CEA.GetLeader]’s visit to Canada, where they shook hands with the Canadian Prime Minister, [CAN.GetLeader], confirming our alliance and commitment to the eradication of the international threat of totalitarianism from all corners of the globe."

Supposedly incapable of supporting our ascension due to our outdated military training and equipment, both of which would have been resolved through our entrance into the Democratic League, this refusal has come as a great disappointment to many in government and across the nation who had hoped our reforms had been enough to convince the free nations of the world we are prepared to fight for the liberation of mankind from tyranny. With the remnants of Ortega loyalists cheering this refusal, claiming it has saved the Republic from engaging in wars against the international proletariat and maintained our independence from the capitalist cabal in Ottawa, the President has attempted to find some positives from this rejection with minimal success. Although this means we will not have to increase funding for the military, a decision that had already been planned and prepared for, the Canadian refusal means we will be entirely defenseless should our foes try to move against us.

Despite assurances by the Americans that their commitment to the Guardian Protocol would not be hindered by the prospect of economic instability, it would appear that these assurances were made before an internal analysis of American military capabilities with our representatives being informed that the American military high command believes it may be spreading itself too thin and that a formal declaration of support would be too much for their economy to handle at the moment. Although our ambassadors are skeptical of this claim, with Yemen and alleged dealings in Cuba proving this argument false, the American pledge to back our independence through diplomatic pressure has been promised, however should the forces of tyranny ever try to breach our defenses, we will not be able to rely on the Americans for support."

With unwavering determination, the President proclaimed an immediate end to this era of stagnation, heralding the resurgence of the revolutionary principles that had ignited the flames of the Sandinista Revolution decades prior. Although never mentioning his brother by name, the call to abandon the principles of the past decade has demonstrated clearly the President's intent, with the remaining Daniel loyalists within ParlaCen disgusted with Ortega’s declaration.

The courts, unwavering in their duty to the nation now that the blindfold of justice has been restored, have rendered unyielding verdicts, resulting in the exile of many perpetrators and the subsequent redistribution of their ill-gotten estates among local farmers. This bold action has garnered widespread acclaim, particularly among rural communities, with numerous grassroots organizations rallying behind President Ortega in resounding support of his efforts to cleanse the nation of corruption and ensure equitable land distribution. Seemingly threatened by this reversal of corruption within the government, several officials still loyal to Daniel have criticized the severity of the punishments distributed, claiming that Humberto has removed a so-called tyrant only to become one himself."

Categorically denying these rumors, President Ortega has now been forced to come up with a justification for this decree rather than relying on his status alone to ensure its enforcement. Arguing that the military cannot be allowed to stagnate and be dominated by outdated doctrines, the President’s words have seemingly fallen flat, with Martha Elena Ruiz Sevilla, Bayardo Ramón Rodriguez Ruiz, and Aminta Granera leading the opposition against this decree. With these figures now directly opposing President Ortega, the effectiveness of the armed forces has now been put into a precarious situation, with some close allies to the President arguing for the reversal of this policy to ensure that the revolution does not splinter into further factionalism.

Knowing precisely where these allegations have come from, Vice President Cruz has once again argued that fostering a robust urban working class remains vital for the advancement of the economy and socialism, reiterating that this does not mean that the urban workforce is being ignored or ever will be ignored.

However, while ParlaCen and the Central Committee have backed the publication, controversy has emerged over a section of the book addressing Marx’s early advocacy for rigorous social critique. Party hardliners have continued to express their concern that this chapter could be interpreted as endorsing criticism against the government which, given the recent student protests and fall of Daniel Ortega, may lead to the emergence and normalization of anti-revolutionary activity. Despite President Ortega’s support for limited forms of social critique, even he has accepted these comments concerned as to where his writings will lead the Republic.

However, with the investigation into this corruption ongoing, the government has chosen to focus its efforts on undoing the worst offenses of the courts to demonstrate a willingness to change and move towards a kinder, gentler era. Most notably, Juan Orlando Hernandez, a prominent Christian Nationalist who was arrested for his ties to the Party of the Christian Path, has now been found to have been detained on fabricated evidence and testimonies. In the face of this damning discovery, some members of the cabinet have proposed suppressing this information, fearing the fallout of exposing this startling revelation and the likelihood of it leading to the release of more known terrorists.

However, the reformation of the state did not end at the announcement of a federalist style of government, with the President unveiling the new national flag to an eager crowd, a red and black banner adorned with the iconic outline of César Augusto Sandino at its center, serving as a symbol of homage to the revolutionary figure upon whose ideals the Republic was founded.

While it would be easy to have these students punished by dissolving the unions, the President has received counsel from more pragmatic figures who have argued that banning the unions outright would do little to ease the tensions between the government and the students. Instead, this counsel has argued that the government should stick with the idea of enforcing a radical reshuffle of its leadership rather than a blanket ban and capitalize on the political vacuum left by Nayib Bukele’s departure. Doing so would ensure that the student unions could be redirected towards supporting the government once more and, although it would take tremendous effort to realign the student's interests, would avoid the fallout from outlawing the unions entirely. Whichever decision the President follows will ultimately be a boon to him and the ongoing reconstruction efforts, the only question that remains is whether Ortega needs to send a clear message or if a lighter hand could be allowed."

While the program has been met with praise across the Republic, lingering elements of opposition to the government have questioned its accuracy, arguing that the program deliberately overstates the President’s role at various points, with these critics arguing that the program is nothing more than historical revisionism, turning President Ortega into a micromanager of every single move made throughout the latter half of the 20th century.

As a child of the Youth Leagues himself, Ruiz is renowned for his unwavering loyalty to President Ortega and Vice President Murillo, having met the two on several occasions in the past during formal events of the Farabundo Youth League. For this reason, Vice President Murillo has now recommended that the newly appointed National Coordinator be included within the government's inner circles, facilitating improved communication between the government and the nation’s youth. While appointing Ruiz to higher office would secure a more professional working relationship between the President and the Youth Leagues, perhaps even mitigating the damage caused by Bukele quicker than originally estimated, the inner circle has long been dominated by officials who have been with Ortega since the beginning, and adding new blood to this established group would undermine its effectiveness at a time when it has to be efficient to ensure continued stability."

 centroamerica.112.d:0 "To address the notable decline in morale following the government’s decision to extend military service, President Ortega has now taken proactive measures to undo this widespread defeatism by delivering a prerecorded speech to recruitment offices and training camps to hopefully instill a sense of purpose into the newest recruits and undo the apathy among experienced soldiers and officers. Drawing from his own experiences in the Sandinista Revolution against the Somoza dictatorship, the President emphasized the generational continuity of the struggle, declaring that soldiers have enlisted to fight so that their children would fight as they do now rather than as he fought. Although the speech was deemed by many to be confusing, the main argument behind Ortega’s message has seemingly resonated with the High Command, with slogans now being produced across the various branches of the military declaring that the Revolution has entered a new phase of fighting for the defense of peace, rather than a rapid assault to destroy capitalism. This impassioned rebranding of the Revolution has proven highly effective in motivating recruits who have begun to realize what their true duty is to the Republic."

In a speech to ParlaCen, the appointed President of the COSE, José Adán Aguerri, asserted that the organization is committed to fostering innovation and economic growth while aligning with the FLNC’s planned economic framework. Despite Ortega and his inner circle having pledged their support for the COSE, skepticism abounds regarding the incorporation of market reforms and the appointment of hardline loyalists to key positions within the organization. As a result, Aguerri’s speech to ParlaCen has now been distributed across the nation, with newspapers and television reporting on the so-called economic reversal from communism. While the media has been placed under tight watch, mitigating the effects of those daring to suggest the reforms are a shift towards capitalism, the damage has already affected the Mayors of the Republic, who have been forced into a corner attempting to justify this shift toward continued collaboration with the very people the President has sworn to destroy."

 centroamerica.114.d:0 "Earlier this week, President Ortega initiated sudden party elections in several rural constituencies, resulting in the elevation of several landowners to the Central Committee. These individuals, only eligible for their candidacy due to their recent party memberships, which were granted by the President, include prominent figures such as Michael Healy Lacayo, leader of Nicaragua’s largest agricultural union and a member of the Superior Council for Enterprise. While these elections have once again caused a stir within ParlaCen, the outcry has been somewhat subdued compared to the President’s announcement establishing the COSE, given that the Council has now had time to prove itself as an effective and efficient agency. Recognizing this acceptance, Ortega has now begun discussions with the cabinet regarding the elevation of Michael Healy to higher office. His influential position has presented a great advantage to consolidating the continued market reforms initiated earlier this year, however, his appointment would run the risk of further alienating the core party membership. While an effective organizer, the inclusion of landowners into the FLNC would spark significant concerns at a time when many are raising questions about the wisdom of the President and whether the market reforms are necessary."

With the Reisebüro eager to expand their operations, initial negotiations were settled within days, with package holidays now being offered to the average working German. However, while the Reisebüro has had success with marketing holidays to places like Cuba, the recent fallout from Hurricane Carlos still linger in the minds of foreign observers leading to fewer than hoped being willing to travel to what they perceive to be a still devastated country, despite recovery efforts ensuring the contrary. As a result, our travel agencies have also been tasked to create lengthy video ads of the beautiful paradise that awaits arriving German tourists. Featuring the sun-kissed beaches of the Republic, the pristine Bay Islands of Northern Honduras, the majestic Ompetepe volcano nestled within the heart of Lake Nicaragua, and the breathtaking Salvadoran El Boqueron National Park, these videos have revealed to our comrades across the Atlantic that despite recent devastation, the Republic stands as an idyllic paradise for the common man. Encouraging all German workers to speak with their workplace managers and secure their flights today, these videos have been somewhat successful, with three charter flights and cruises already fully booked, marking the beginning of a new era for our tourist industry."

Amidst a ceremony honoring the reserve’s vital role in nurturing the Republic’s ecosystem, however, a notable absence loomed- representatives of the Miskito and Mayangna indigenous communities, who inhabit parts of the reserve. This seemingly intentional omission has now sparked a controversy among the indigenous community and the remnants of opposition to the government, with both now bringing attention to the President’s long and hostile history with native peoples and the contentious establishment of reserve borders without their consultation. However, this backlash has seemingly been completely ignored by the President and his supporters, who have instead chosen to focus on the President’s environmentalism, praising him for the visit and his dedication to caring for the Earth. Still, the President has now elected to avoid visiting the Reserve in the future, arguing that the FLNC must first control the narrative of indigenous relations before pursuing the environmentalist message any further."

As a stalwart ally of the Sandinistas and a luminary in Liberation Theology, the meeting between Ortega and Cardenal quickly turned to politics. At the heart of the discussion lay Cardenal’s impassioned pleas for presidential support in the publication and dissemination of his seminal work “The Gospel of Solentiname.” Arguing for the transformative potential of Liberation Theology as a conduit for bridging the gap between the Sandinista government and religious and traditional communities, Cardenal’s proposal underscores the efforts that Ortega has sought to complete since the completion of the Sandinista Revolution decades prior. While acknowledging the pivotal role Liberation Theology has played in expanding the FLNC’s reach among the impoverished and devout citizens of our Republic, the prospect of forging an official alliance with elements of the Church presents a palpable dilemma for the President, who has recognized the impact this would have on the staunchly secular elements of the party and populace. However, an element of control over the direction the Church takes would go a long way in finalizing the President’s control over the nation, and even the staunchest of Marxists would be fools to not accept that control over the Church would ultimately end the chances of the opiate spreading out of control."

These restrictions, enacted shortly after the unification of the Republic, aimed at establishing a fully atheist state through methodical and precise curbing of the Church's involvement in politics and confining religious practices to private settings. However, following today's negotiations, bishops and priests have now been allowed to openly conduct religious ceremonies once again, albeit under the condition that they refrain from directly referencing government policy, the FLNC, the Central American Revolution, and direct criticism of the state. Despite hopes that the Church would once more be allowed to become involved in politics, President Ortega has insisted that the separation of Church and state remains intact and that no bishop nor preacher shall enter ParlaCen under his administration. Though disappointing for many, the end of the restrictions of worship has been met with overwhelming support, with the Catholic and religious communities seeing this as the first step towards equality and the end of the state's ambitions to enforce atheism across the Republic."

However, to minimize conservative backlash and keep traditional elements of society somewhat aligned with the FLNC’s interests, this progressive step only extends to civil unions, as recognition of spiritual marriages was deemed a step too far for many within ParlaCen. While the Legalization Act was watered down, the move has still sparked significant controversy among the conservative factions within the party, who have questioned President Ortega’s decision to readily allow such a dramatic change to the Republic, even if it stops short of full marriage equality. Despite the FLNC splitting over the matter, the President has garnered significant support from the youth, who have supported this sudden change of heart. While the support of these ministers will be easily regained, even if it will take great effort to convince them that the President remains committed to a conservative doctrine, the gained support from the youth will outweigh any previous alliances held within ParlaCen, as now a new era of socialists are prepared to support Ortega and his policies so long as he maintains the course and continues to support tepid social reforms."

Beginning his attempts, President Bukele has begun to engage with workers in various industries to address their concerns, discussing matters as grand as frequent equipment breakdown to minor issues such as the water cooler dispensing water that is slightly too warm. With many speaking on how down to earth the President was, reflecting on his openness and willingness to engage with matters that others would deem trivial, it seems as though the factory workers the President met with are beginning to appreciate this style of leadership, struggling to recall the last time Daniel Ortega visited their workplace. While this initiative will not immediately elevate the President’s popularity to the level of his predecessor, with plans for further factory and farm visits already being prepared, the outset of this campaign has already proven to be a significant propaganda win, with images of Bukele conversing and dining with workers circulating across the Republic."

This strike, previously prohibited under Daniel Ortega’s regime, has only been made possible by President Bukele’s recent labor reforms, which have granted workers legal protections for such actions. While the restoration of the right to strike has been greatly appreciated by unions across the Republic, its long absence has resulted in members of the public turning against their fellow man, with many party hardliners decrying the bus and rail strikes as a band of greedy reactionaries, and citizens refusing to support the strikes due to the effect it has on their everyday lives. As pressure has begun to mount for a resolution to this disruption, President Bukele has proposed personally negotiating with the strike leaders, seeing that this strike is his doing, expressing confidence in his ability to find an acceptable compromise. Conversely, despite the President’s image improving among the populace, particularly the unions, others have advocated that the matter be left in the hands of the Department of Transportation, trusting their expertise to navigate the situation effectively. With the unexpected scale of this strike now inflicting a bitter defeat onto the Bukele administration, a decision must be made quickly to ensure that the loyalty of the unions, party, and populace is maintained."

Specializing in electronics and advanced technology, it is hoped that the rapid industrialization will lead to the expansion of the town, with estimates already putting the population increase to one hundred and fifty thousand within seven years, provided that workers are willing to relocate to plants and apartment complexes within the town's borders. Speaking at the opening ceremony, President Bukele emphasized that through rapid industrialization, the Republic will finally be able to advance into the twenty-first century, elevating its technological capabilities to compete with global leaders like the American People’s Commonwealth and Europe. While environmentalists and residents have claimed that this rapid expansion will be disastrous for the surrounding forests and rapidly increase pollution, such concerns have been swept aside following a resounding endorsement of the project from local councils and the Mayors of El Salvador."

Proposing that the FLNC disband itself and then subsequently vote to restore itself under a decentralized constitution granting regional party leaderships greater authority over decisions about party membership and the appointment of representatives to ParlaCen and the Politburo. While still a confusing matter, with many questioning why the President did not simply table a motion to amend the FLNC’s constitution, Bukele has sought to gamble his way forward, recognizing that an immediate party constitutional change would require over three-quarters support from all branches of government while tabling the motion as a legislative policy merely requires a simple majority. Seeking to also empower regional leaders and promote the elevation of party members who better represent their respective regions, diverging from the centralized leadership of Managua, the Federalization Bill has now been a hotly debated topic but has now passed on the slimmest of margins, allowing the President to begin the reforms he deems necessary to the party without engaging in a lengthy constitutional debate.

While the decision had initially caused little controversy, with most citizens in the city either not noticing its removal or accepting the removal as a necessity, the local chapter of the FLNC has now brought attention to the matter, questioning its removal and demanding that it be restored in part or whole. Demanding that the legacy of Ortega be respected in some manner, the Managua chapter has now placed forward their plans for the Plaza de la Revolución arguing that it should be remodeled entirely to reflect the successes of the whole revolution, from Ortega to Bukele. However, while this would be an acceptable compromise that would satisfy all parties, acceptance of Ortega’s legacy has brought forward some concerns from Bukele loyalists who argue that the failures of the Ortega government and his renowned authoritarianism have invalidated him as a hero of the revolution. Instead, many, especially Minister Xavier Bukele, have suggested that the statue be replaced with a monument honoring his cousin and his successful attempts to steer the revolution back on course."

This achievement not only dramatically reduced travel times between Managua and San Salvador, with the trip now taking a mere two and a half hours, but has also substantially decreased the cost of the journey by forty Acres and is substantially cheaper than the eight-hour journey via car, and more environmentally friendly than the fifty-minute plane journey. In the televised speech to the nation, Bukele and members of the Ministry for Transportation departed on the maiden voyage of the LAV San Salvador-Managua, showcasing not only the system’s speed and reliability but also its comfort and sophistication.

With legislation already being prepared for the expansion of this framework, should the Central American Revolution continue along its current course, the political reforms have not ended with a fundamental recodifying of the Republic’s constitution but also with the state being rebranded as the Socialist Federal Republic of Centroamerica, accompanied by a redesigned flag inspired by Yugoslavia, whose federalism has long inspired President Bukele.

Seemingly discontent with spending the remainder of his life on the sidelines, Hernández has pledged to return to politics once he has settled back into his home life and reconciled with his wife, Ana, who was spared a guilty verdict in 2006 following Hernández’s assertion she had not acted with him in his affiliation with the Christian Path."

While merely exercising their right to protest, this rhetoric has been off putting for many within the party who have deemed this behavior as unacceptable and a poor start to any negotiations.

Marking another seismic shift away from Ortega’s former policy, in which these lands were held in state ownership only in name, with most assets controlled by individuals loyal to the former President, the affected landowners have ferociously protested these actions, denouncing the executive order as tyrannical overreach. Arguing that this expropriation undermines property rights and sets a dangerous precedent for private enterprise in the Republic, these landowners have now begun a series of united protests across the country, even gaining the favor of some elements of the conservative FLNC. Despite this outcry, the joint political influence of these landowners has been unable to mount any legitimate threat to the order, with the opposition joint in their support for the President’s decision to further undermine the remnants of Ortega loyalists in government, even if disagreement over the method of this confiscation has begun within ParlaCen.

While universal healthcare had previously been an established right within the Republic, with conservative figures in the FLNC voting against the amendment for this exact reason, it had long been mired by bureaucracy and lengthy waiting lists that resulted from the service's unofficial, though legally binding, hierarchy which granted FLNC party officials the right to a doctor first. With the President eager to work with all members of the opposition to undo this entrenched right, it was ultimately Manuel Zelaya and Civic Action who acted as a key player in ensuring this amendment passed, with the United Opposition rejecting any chance of bipartisan discussions seeing universal healthcare as an already unaffordable goal that would become more bloated should this bill pass. Receiving the full backing of Civic Action, who had only requested that the amendment not undermine the chance for the establishment of private healthcare in the future, the bill quickly gained the needed votes to be implemented within the constitution. Although scorned by the right, who continue to view this progress as the continued collapse of the freedoms that were enshrined to the people by the removal of Ortega, those with a more critical mindset have viewed this as the FLNC continuing to act on its promises of establishing a functioning welfare state where all are equal to their fellow citizen."

While the UTC is envisioned to be the spiritual successor of the CST, a key difference has been emphasized by the government, the union will not be a tool of the FLNC and will operate independently of the government, allowing it to act on the wishes of its membership, not the demands of the President. However, with the UTC receiving funding from the government, these claims of total autonomy have been heavily criticized, with Funes insisting that the funding is only temporary to allow the union to begin its operations and rebuild trust and credibility among workers who may be skeptical of a successor to the CTS. With its success depending entirely on whether the union will be able to demonstrate its independence and separate itself from its legacy, only time will tell if the workers of the Republic are still committed to collective bargaining or if Zelaya’s reforms have condemned organized labor to the history books."

Though branded as populist nonsense by various members of ParlaCen, with the United Opposition and Civic Action arguing it continues the tradition held by Ortega and his domination of the airwaves, the first episode has garnered overwhelmingly positive feedback, with viewers outside of the Anti-Corruption Party’s base appreciating the straight-forward reporting and the President’s clear and friendly mannerisms. While criticism continues to pour in from those demanding an end to government interference in the media, the channel approval has all but assured its continuation, with President Nasralla eager to provide a platform for direct communication with the public, hoping to rebuild confidence in the government and a greater understanding of government processes."

 centroamerica.136.d:0 "In a contentious decision, President Nasralla, following lengthy discussions with Vice President Alemán, has officially welcomed the return of the United Fruit Company to invest and operate in Central America by overturning the Foreign Investment Act, an act implemented shortly after unification to expel and halt imperialist companies from the Republic’s markets. This return of the CFU has been highly controversial, resulting in small scale protests among fruit farmers. Seeking to allay public concerns by emphasizing that the repeal of the Foreign Investment Act does not override current foreign company laws, which are still designed to limit the influence of companies in politics, President Nasralla has asserted that these regulations will prevent a repeat of past abuses, yet has refused to commit to ensuring that the United Fruit Company will have to abide by state legislation when it comes to employment and working hours practices. Despite these assurances and the supposed economic benefits this foreign investment could bring, the public remains wary. The privatization of the most profitable sector of the economy has brought significant worry to many, as while legislation will prevent the CFU from returning to the power it held throughout the twentieth century, the precedent has now been set for privatization to begin with many fearing how far it will be taken."

 centroamerica.137.d:0 "In a landmark event for the Republic’s foreign relations, President Nasralla has successfully concluded his diplomatic visit to Venezuela, where he met with President [VEN.GetLeader] and representatives of [CUB.GetLeader]’s government. Since the arrest and subsequent exile of Daniel Ortega in the wake of his attempted coup, relations with both Venezuela and Cuba have been particularly strained, with both states implementing an unofficial diplomatic embargo on Central America. Only agreeing to meet with President Nasralla so long as the possibility of Ortega’s return was up for debate, Nasralla has now succeeded in his primary aim of the meeting and rebuilt relations between Managua, Havana, and Caracas. With Ortega’s exile discussed briefly, with Nasralla rejecting any immediate proposals but stating that the issue would remain on the table for as long as his presidency continued, the success of this visit is particularly notable as it has represented a clear shift in the public perception of the President with many now accepting him as a statesman rather than a mere sports commentator. With the end of the diplomatic embargo, it is hoped that trade and security agreements can now be discussed between the three powers of the Caribbean. However, Nasralla’s willingness to embrace these two states and discuss the potential return of Ortega has begun to send shockwaves throughout the government, with Vice President Alemán reportedly furious he was not informed of this caveat of negotiations and the hardliners within the vestiges of the FLNC demanding that Ortega be returned immediately."

Drawing on an internal investigation conducted by his administration, Nasralla asserted that corruption pervades every level of governance in the country and, in extreme cases, has become the accepted norm. While government corruption is a long-standing issue in the Republic, the President has pointedly connected the current state of affairs to former President Ortega’s tenure, arguing that despite the efforts of President Zelaya and himself, Ortega's goons continue to run the bureaucracy. Now vowing to pursue justice against those perpetuating these corrupt practices to the fullest extent of the law, President Nasralla invited his predecessor onto his show to demonstrate the broad support for anti-corruption legislation in ParlaCen. Political analysts have interpreted Nasralla’s statements both as a strategic move to consolidate his position and reaffirm his commitment to his party’s namesake and a measure to undo the failures of his first one hundred days in office, which became swamped in coalition talks that ultimately halted the implementation of any meaningful legislation. With public support entirely on the President’s side, and ParlaCen anticipating a wholesale anti-corruption bill to be presented to them in the coming weeks, the pledge to combat corruption has resonated well with the Republic, with devastating consequences seemingly awaiting Nasralla should he fail his renewed promise to enshrine a sense of honesty to politics."

These historic proceedings have encompassed a wide range of government servants, including bureaucrats, police chiefs, and former city mayors, and include crimes such as bribery, embezzlement, money laundering, and extortion. While a largely popular move, with various Ortega figures now behind bars or awaiting their lengthy trials, opponents to this move have denounced the President’s actions as a politically motivated witch hunt that threatens to destabilize the country’s civil administration as the police continue to search for corruption in the Ministry of Fisheries and local cinema complexes. Even the President’s coalition partners have echoed this opposition, with Vice President Alemán making the case for a more focused assault against corruption rather than this gung-ho attack that has divided the nation and the government. With division once more filling the Presidential House, the tensions between the President and Vice President have brought to the forefront the possibility of the collapse of the Coalition of Freedom, with Nasralla eager to ensure his anti-corruption measures are passed to the fullest extent, regardless of whether his allies stand in his way."

An investigatory article published by La Prensa has revealed evidence of Vice President Arnoldo Alemán receiving bribes from various sources, including the United Fruit Company, recently arrested regional administrators and other foreign dignitaries. The report alleges that Alemán’s corrupt behavior has been ongoing throughout his tenure, with the most egregious claim being that he has recently purchased a luxury villa near Chepes Beach with said bribes. With the reports of the purchase of the villa being verified by residents of the Bay Islands, who have reported seeing Alemán’s security detail present over the last few weeks. The United Fruit Company and the currently incarcerated former regional administrators have however, refused to comment when approached by La Prensa journalists allowing the Vice President some reprieve. However, even without comment, the evidence against the Vice President is staggering, with the public rightly outraged at the hypocrisy of the government’s actions and whether President Nasralla had any knowledge of Alemán’s dealings. With neither willing to show their face in public and the upcoming Hour with the President canceled, the media has pledged to continue to take action until Alemán is held accountable for his crimes."

This resurgence has successfully fostered and restored healthy competition to the once heavily politicized game, ushering in a new generation of fans. However, with this newfound attention, the most recent match between the Honduran teams C.D. Olympia and Motagua have made national headlines for more troubling reasons. Following the conclusion of the match, which ended two-one in Motagua’s favor, clashes erupted between Olympia supporters and police present at the stadium. Instigating a small riot by overturning trash cans, vandalizing local businesses, and engaging in physical altercations with Motagua supporters, the violence prompted the deployment of police to the area to restore order, leading to a direct clash that lasted just under two hours. By 11 PM, the situation had been contained, and medical attention was being delivered to those who needed it, with all three branches of the emergency services getting involved in some capacity. C.D. Olympia has refused to comment on the behavior of their supporters, drawing significant criticism and highlighting the darker side of football culture, sparking debate about whether the government’s promotion of the sport was the right course of action."

Riddled by bureaucracy, centralized planning around Ortega’s wishes, and, confusingly, close cooperation with private businesses, this form of red capitalism has been thoroughly denounced by the President time and time again for its ineffectiveness. Now, armed with a refreshed mandate, Zelaya has unveiled his alternative, the National Plan to Combat Communism, which has become known as simply the Zelaya Plan. Unlike its predecessor, the President has assured the nation it will remain ideologically consistent with Civic Action’s platform, promising an ambitious reform plan that will hope to revitalize the Republic’s economy through a series of bold initiatives: privatization of state assets, the attraction of foreign investors, and the immediate liberalization of the market. While the majority held by the President in ParlaCen has assured that his efforts to salvage the economy from years of mismanagement will not be blocked by the opposition, the plan is not without its critics. Skeptics have argued that the sweeping privatizations could lead to increased inequality and social unrest and have claimed that an overreliance on foreign investment will lead to the surrender of national sovereignty to the likes of Canada or Mexico. Despite these reservations, President Zelaya remains confident his plan will be successful and that the people of Central America will soon live in prosperity."

With the Republic’s private sector being relatively underdeveloped, the only company capable of affording and effectively exploiting these resources is Grupo Centroamericano, a firm primarily composed of former Ortega ministers from the mining and forestry sectors. Naturally, this has raised significant alarm bells within the President’s cabinet, with the economic ministry concerned that these ministers, while having run an effective company for decades, are now at risk of holding a monopoly over the sector, which may undermine the goals of the Zelaya Plan. Glossing over the ideological differences, the ministry has urged that President Zelaya invite foreign companies immediately to participate in the bidding process, thereby ensuring a more competitive and balanced marketplace. However, seemingly gaining knowledge of the upcoming bidding war, Alvaro Robelo, the CEO of the GC, has sought to reassure Zelaya and his administration, stating that their primary intention is to ensure that the Republic’s resources remain under national control and that any preferential treatment given to them will be repaid in kind. Standing at the first crossroads of his presidency, Zelaya must now decide what matters most to his economic plan: national sovereignty or a competitive market."

Recognizing that Canada was one of the first countries to acknowledge his government and congratulate his reforms, Zelaya has now actively sought Ottawa’s assistance in integrating the Republic into the global market, meeting with Canadian economic advisors and Prime Minister [CAN.GetLeader]. The meeting, taking place in Tegucigalpa, began with the coverage of a wide range of critical topics, including the promise of Canadian economic investments and shared details of security threats in the Caribbean. Following the conclusion of this initial meeting, President Zelaya and Prime Minister [CAN.GetLeader] held a joint press conference to discuss the development of the two nations' relationship. Stating that the foundations of their relations were strong and that Ottawa was pleased with the Republic’s transition towards democracy, the Prime Minister ended the press conference stating that, perhaps in the future, they would look forward to walking hand-in-hand as allies with Managua. Naturally, this comment has sent a flurry of excitement across the nation, as millions are now eager to join our democratic allies in the global democratic community.

Describing his accomplishments in great detail, the President claimed to have lifted thousands out of poverty, fostered national prosperity, and transformed the Republic into a haven for economic liberty. These statements, while bold, have indeed resonated with many citizens' lives across the nation, with polling indicating that over seventy percent of those polled believe their lives have improved thanks to the dismantling of the Ortega Model. However, amidst the polling and the data, which experts have attempted to fact-check, there lies the harsh realities of the Zelaya Plan. Having carefully chosen the areas of Chiltiupan to visit, the camera crews were able to show the most successful revitalization projects of the poorest city in the country, purposefully missing out on the mass poverty, unemployment, and disease that still runs rampant across this and other similar settlements. While the general perception is that the Zelaya Plan is working, the reality of cities like Chiltiupan reveals the harsh reality that there remains significant work before Zelaya’s declaration of victory over economic tyranny can truly hold any legitimacy, and while citizens of the Republic are aware of the economic disparity between their fellow countrymen, it seems as though the beginnings of individualism are now beginning to reach hold of the Republic as, as polling revealed, most seem to only care for their own pockets."

While it is no secret that Ortega had a direct hand in the selection of mayors and the policies they would implement over their tenure, the deluge of denouncements has now revealed just how total this control was over the roles of the mayors who have all stated that they could not begin construction projects nor even lift a finger without approval from Managua. While President Zelaya and now Regional Administrator Sunseri had already confirmed this during their initial revolt against Ortega, most had dismissed this now-proven fact as a mere fantasy devised by the two to further turn public opinion against the dictator. With denouncements arriving from all departments across the Republic, the only Regional Administrator who has refused to denounce former President Ortega is Irís Montenegro, who has called out her colleagues for alleged political opportunism, given that local elections are around the corner. Unfortunately for President Zelaya, this refusal could not come at a worse time as the police have now concluded an investigation into Montenegro and her deputies, which has now proven widespread abuses of power and extreme levels of corruption continue to be prevalent under her watch. Having now been arrested, with her deputy being sworn in as the Regional Administrator of the Managua Department, despite heavy protest by her supporters who claim this to be a witch hunt to prevent her reelection, the end of Ortega’s grip over local governance may finally be coming to an end."

Among minor revisions to the English curriculum and the literature being consumed by students, the most notable, and controversial, change has come to the History curricula. While there has been a continued focus on the teaching of the history of Centroamerica, there has now been a renewed focus on the removal of historical bias, which the Ministry for Education has claimed and proven is littered throughout the various modules. Unsurprisingly, this announcement has provoked a strong backlash from the FLNC, who have accused the government of politicizing education and tarnishing the legacy of those who fought and died for the Sandinista cause, arguing that the new curriculum undermines the sacrifices made by citizens of the Republic and distorts historical truths to serve current political agendas. In response to this accusation, the Ministry has defended the changes, stating that a critical examination of history is essential to genuinely honoring the dead and educating future generations. With it evident that the remnants of the left are only angered by this change because it will now have teachers educate students of the horrors of their heroes, the President is relieved that fact is no longer being ignored in schools across the Republic for a tamer fiction that paints the Republic as the bastion of freedom and justice throughout a period that was wrought with vile acts and murder on both sides."

Within the cabinet and the party, a growing faction has continued to advocate for the President to fully embrace this title, and actively promote it through state media, seeing it as a perfect opportunity to already begin campaigning for the next elections. Outside of a chance for a successful campaign strategy, many more within this clique have argued that during these trying times of uncertainty and transition, the populace need a unifying figure to guide them and embody their aspirations for a democratic future. While an entirely populistic mantle, becoming the people’s champion and the Father of the Republic, is something that has appealed to Zelaya since his election, with international media already referring to him with the title. However, critics have suggested that such a mantle is nothing more than a poor attempt at recycling Ortega’s old personality cult, stating that the time for a powerful head of government is now at an end."

Currently, the constitution permits the nomination of a Deputy or Second Vice President to assist with the workload should it be deemed necessary. While the current Vice President, Maximino Martínez, has not made any requests, he has stated that he would be welcome to any assistance the President wishes to offer him, arguing that not only for the sake of workload but for succession should anything occur during his term in office a second would be appreciated. However, the proposal has stirred some unease within Civic Action and ParlaCen, with the United Opposition drawing parallels to the President’s predecessor, who appointed his wife as Vice President and blurred the lines between personal and political spheres.

Meeting with the Pope, Hernández emphasized the shared political history of the Vatican with that of Central America, arguing that the two had been unjustly punished by the Godless forces of communism, stressing the importance of a united front against the vile ideology, which he perceives as a lingering threat within the Republic and across Italy. Although it is unclear whether His Holiness agreed with Hernández’s assessment of the situation and his analysis of history, he has agreed to provide economic assistance to Central America, remarking that only through the continued prosperity of both states can they hope to avoid the resurgence of the now-defeated foe.

However, despite the assertions of the opposition, the President has been able to save a shred of credibility, because the constitution allows for such dismissal, so long as the majority of ParlaCen is in agreement. With all forty-one representatives of the United Opposition agreeing with the President’s decision, such claims of authoritarianism have quickly subsided, given the legality of the dismissal. However, despite being within his legal right, the President still faces challenges surrounding the credibility of the accusations made against those dismissed, with many demanding proof of their loyalties to Ortega. Yet with the Regional Administrator of Managua, Irís Montenegro, now pleading guilty to abuse of power and corruption, it seems such evidence will not be required as the last ally of Ortega left in government now sits behind bars, all but confirming the treason of the rest.

Although the Republic is officially a secular nation, this new legislation has cast doubt on this, with many believing that the President will soon seek to amend the constitution to change the state religion. While the religious and conservative elements in society have warmly embraced these laws, viewing them as a necessary protection against further moral decline instigated by previous governments, liberal and socialist groups have once more challenged the President, accusing Hernández of attempting to transform Centroamerica into a theocracy where he sits as its priest. Denouncing such accusations, the President has stated he is merely acting on the popular will of the nation and that he has no desire to exceed his duties as a representative of the people nor a follower of Christ.

Experts have noted that the increased availability of narcotics, including other more potent substances, might be a contributing factor to this spike. While the Health Ministry has attempted to pinpoint a specific cause for this surge, and the government's response is vague and lacking clarity, only attributing the rise in drug abuse to morale failures stemming from the legacy of Ortega and the FLNC, the opposition has had much to say on the matter. Demanding to know why the government was not made aware of this rise sooner, Manuel Zelaya demanded to know whether or not the nation had suddenly changed its name overnight, asking whether the President lived in Central America or ‘Fentral America’. Refusing to comply with such disgusting questioning and demanding an apology for the opposition's attempt to politicize this tragedy, the government has now issued a clear statement aiming that it will begin to implement an extensive campaign aimed at combating drug use.

While there is no official justification for why the firefight began, the police have now explained it as a simple fight over territory. The rising violence has now been attributed to the cartels somehow becoming more heavily armed, with many now possessing low-grade military weapons, body armor, and mild explosive devices in the most serious cases, with the government pointing fingers at corrupt soldiers, accusing them of selling surplus military equipment for personal gain. However, experts have cast doubt on this explanation, arguing that the sheer quantity and sophistication of the weapons being used by the cartels far exceed what could be supplied by a handful of corrupt soldiers.

As the President reaffirms their support for Central American unity, the withdrawal from the region has been met with fierce criticism and support, as critics of the withdrawal argue that the President is bending the knee to terrorists instead of attempting to spread the glory of unity across the region, whilst supporters argue the President is acting in the best interests of both Managua and San José. Although the order to withdraw has now been heard by all soldiers stationed across Costa Rica, it will take significant time for an orderly withdrawal to be completed with the Mayor of Costa Rica assisting in the relocation of equipment and the establishment of a transitional government that will lead the nation towards its independence. Whilst a dangerous pledge, the President has also confirmed that they will begin a tour of Costa Rica to apologize to the populace for Managua’s occupation in the hopes of fostering a working relationship once Costa Rica is independent."

Despite the local populace hurling eggs and bricks at the President, [CEA.Getleader] insisted that they had to begin their speech and begin the process of healing even if it led to their untimely demise. Forcing their way through a crowd, the President arrived at the podium and began to address a crowd of thousands who arrived out of sheer curiosity given the recent policy change. Continuously booed throughout the start of their speech, the President aimed to convey that the winds had finally changed direction in the government and that for years, the people of Costa Rica had been brutally sidelined and cracked down upon solely for their desire for self-determination. Stating clearly that an apology would not bring back the dead, the President offered their wholehearted apology to a nation that had no right to accept it and promised to oversee the pardoning of all Costa Rican citizens who were unjustly arrested. Although the crowd remained silent after the speech, the President is certain their words have now made a difference."

Though it was anticipated that this confirmation would send shockwaves across Costa Rica, the extent of which was not properly accounted for with government buildings, police stations, and public services facing the brunt of a renewed assault against the government. Recognizing the reality of the situation, the President has ordered the police to respond leniently, refusing to allow the situation to descend into further chaos. Addressing the region from the capital, the President has recognized the reasons behind this protest but has requested that all participating end their involvement, arguing that the release of this information was not done to incite a riot or force a response but to begin rebuilding trust between Costa Rica and Centroamerica. Although many have continued to riot, with most being placed into holding cells for a twenty-four-hour period, this address has seemingly reached the heart of most protestors who have begun to steadily return to their homes."

With this announcement, a mixture of celebrations and protests have filled the streets of Costa Rica with thousands reveling in the chance for independence to finally be granted to them. However, many more have brought up the conspiracy theory that the last referendum was rigged by the Centroamerican government and worry that the same fate will befall this one. Promising to allow a fair vote on the matter, the President has sought to ease tensions by promising to sit out the affair and allow democracy to take its course. Despite this promise, many have refused to take it at face value believing that like before the exit poll will reveal a landslide result in favor of remaining under the thumb of Managua. With trust in the government at an all time low in Costa Rica, this belief has significantly heightened turnout prospects for the referendum with initial polling demonstrating a seventy-four percent swing in favor of Costa Rican independence."

Whilst this neglect has led to a drop in approval for the President and increased his opponents' polling numbers, Zelaya has now decreed that help for the struggling agencies and citizens is finally on its way following an announcement that the Republic was opening its borders to trade with non-communist states across South America and the Caribbean. With trade having been limited under Ortega to the surrounding communist states, this sudden rise in available trade partners has come with the benefit of most wishing to facilitate the beginning of a working economic relationship. As Peru, Brazil, Mexico, and countless others offer to send equipment to aid with the recovery from Hurricane Carlos, the President’s approval rating has now improved as most begin to realize his actions were not intentionally neglectful. However, despite the beginnings of recovery, many continue to resent the President for his actions, seeing his neglect as the reason behind their continued suffering and, in extreme cases, the reason behind the loss of their loved ones."

 centroamerica.164.d:0 "Since its founding in 1975 following the establishment of the Junta of National Construction in Nicaragua, the Sandinista Popular Army, now officially the Centroamerican Popular Army, has been instrumental in shaping the Republic we recognize today. As the primary force tasked with safeguarding the Republic’s sovereignty and stability, the armed forces occupy a significant place within the national consciousness, rendering any discussion of its potential reformation as one of the most contentious issues in recent political memory. Retaining the same structure it has held since 1975, the Popular Army is largely a decentralized, community-focused force, initially intended to be nothing more than a militia, with its leadership dispersed, and an emphasis on local communities’ ability to defend themselves- a model that has been fiercely defended by the Sandinista old guard. These veterans have insisted that the decentralized approach not only serves to embody the revolutionary spirit but also ensures that every community remains empowered and vigilant against external threats. However, with modern warfare quickly demonstrating itself to echo the battles of the Second World War, this traditionalist view is being challenged by a new generation of officers, who claim that a decentralized guerilla force is incapable of protecting the people and leads overall to a worse professional standard. While the Republic is poised to avoid war, war seemingly has a way of arriving when one least expects it, and this debate must be settled sooner rather than later if the revolution is to survive."

 centroamerica.165.t:0 "The Matter of Politicisation"
 centroamerica.165.d:0 "The Centroamerican Popular Army, with its roots as a decentralized militia, has long been characterized by a unique structure where officers command strong ideological loyalty from their soldiers. While once effective, this structure has given rise to a politically charged environment within the ranks, where officers and soldiers often hold and express their political views that may diverge sharply from the official doctrine of the government. While there is little concern that these officers might actively seek to undermine the government, the politicization of the armed forces has led to significant challenges in fostering cooperation across different army groups with, in extreme cases, this having escalated to the point where certain officers refuse to collaborate with their counterparts. In light of these issues, a growing number of politicians have begun to advocate for the depoliticization of the armed forces, arguing that breaking up the larger, politically cohesive cliques within the army and imposing strict penalties on officers who make public political statements could help restore unity and discipline within the ranks, allowing for a neutral and professional military environment. However, some have contended that the outspoken nature of many officers plays a crucial role in forging strong bonds with their units, arguing that these bonds, which are often rooted in shared political beliefs and values, contribute to the flexibility of the army and that ideological discussion has served as one of the many pillars of the Popular Army since 1975. An enforced censorship, according to these officers, would only further exacerbate tensions and may turn the military against the government, should they believe they are being silenced for their beliefs."

While in usual circumstances, such a request could easily end with a deal, international tensions have meant that it would perhaps be in our best interests if we were to maintain our reserve fighters rather than sell them to the highest bidder. At any moment, war could be thrust upon us, either through a declaration or through a proxy, and our senior military commanders have insisted that to ensure that our armed forces remain at peak operational capability, we only continue to add, not remove, equipment to our stockpiles. However, the case can easily be made that the sale of these fighters will only further increase our capabilities to produce and construct, given the substantial sum of [CEA.GetNameDef] is willing to offer us to ensure this deal is worthwhile to us. By reinvesting this payment into our industries, we will be able to quickly replenish our stockpiles and negate the immediate loss of five squadrons before their absence is noted by our enemies."

With a substantial fee being paid to our partners for this venture to have been finalized, some worry we have been swindled by the leading nations in the world to receive inferior equipment to what is currently available. While this may be true, the President has insisted that such a deal was necessary no matter the cost if it means that in the future, the cities of the Republic are protected from missiles, rockets, and all other sorts of projectiles that seek to harm the innocents of the nation. To sweeten the deal and to ensure that their fighters are not wasted, [From.GetNation] has also agreed to send advisors to Managua that will train our pilots on the basics of these fighters and teach our engineers how best to repair them should they ever return to base damaged. With these squadrons expected to arrive within the coming weeks, the armed forces are now relieved that, despite the cost, the skies of the Republic will now be better prepared for war."

Arguing that these fighters, despite them being previous generation technology, cannot easily be replaced no matter how much we pay, our potential partners have now shut down all future discussions and our offer of an immediate payment package rather than the previously suggested three-year repayment. While our investment would have been more than enough for our potential partners to reinvest in their industries and quickly rebuild their stockpiles, such discussions were not enough to change their minds as now we must continue to build our airforce alone. Naturally depressed by such news, President [CEA.GetLeader] has now ordered the completion of five squadrons of fighters within the same timeframe as the suggested payment to [From.GetName]. While some are skeptical that such a squadron can be assembled that quickly, and insist that the quality of these fighters won’t be the same as those we had sought to purchase, the armed forces have agreed with the President’s demand, calling for the skies of the Republic to be safeguarded before they are dominated by our foes."

However, despite having the funding of the government behind them, the delegates failed to attract a significant number of people to the event, with the media having to utilize careful camera trickery to fool the nation into believing thousands had attended the event. However, despite televisions across Costa Rica displaying that inflated number of attendees, word has quickly spread regarding the truth of the event, as the Leave camp has now revealed only an estimated two hundred attended. Though a supposed setback for the government, the fact of the matter remains that we control the narrative of this referendum and we shall not allow our Republic to be divided by separatists seeking to undo years of development and the awakening of a Central American identity."

Denouncing his former beliefs, which had placed him on FLNC’s watchlist back in 2008, the Mayor has claimed his change of heart has come from his realization that while the dream of independence may be tantalizing it fails to properly consider the economic situation a newly independent Costa Rican state would find itself in. Arguing that the average Costa Rican citizen would be better off economically to remain a member of the Republic, the Mayor has now been questioned why his change of heart was so sudden, given that mere days ago, he had pledged his support behind the Leave campaign. Refusing to comment, similar speeches have come from other Costa Rican officials who have, likewise, changed their stances seemingly overnight.

Despite assertions by the opposition that this is an attempt by Managua to control the outcome of the referendum, the armed forces have merely taken the place of the tellers for safeguarding purposes and have admitted their presence is intentionally intimidating to dissuade those who would interfere with the democratic process. However, this is only the official story, and the truth of the matter, as rightly guessed by our opposition, is to ensure that the outcome of the election ends in our favor with ballots already being cast in their thousands in favor of remaining within the Republic."

Thousands of pamphlets and leaflets were distributed highlighting the benefits of remaining within the Republic while a chant of 'Unity!' spread like a chorus throughout the region's capital. With the media picking up on the event, the pro-Remain camp has demonstrated to the Costa Rican people the power of their movement while hopefully convincing thousands to vote in favor of remaining. In response to this, the pro-Leave camp has made plans to organize their own marches across the region, hoping to counteract the sudden shift in the polls. As the people continue to contemplate their decision, this rally which is estimated to have had over ten thousand in attendance, remains a perfect start to securing the survival of the Republic in its current form."

Steering clear of directly referencing the Costa Rican referendum, the President instead referred to Hurricane Carlos and how the people had shown tremendous courage throughout the recovery efforts, praising all who aided in relief efforts and thanking the hard-working construction crews who oversaw the rapid reconstruction of the country. Taking this further, the President spoke on how this collective unity represented the ideals of the Centroamerican Dream and that Carlos had demonstrated that the Dream was alive and well even in the twenty-first century. Relating this struggle to current divisions, the President argued that if people no longer wished to subscribe to this Dream shared by millions, that is entirely within their right, stating that neither the government nor anyone would seek to influence this decision.

From soup kitchens to after-school events, these charitable services have been very effective in demonstrating that the people of Costa Rica need the continued aid of the Republic, for without Managua’s aid, these simple and needed services would disappear overnight. However, as expected, the Leave campaign has asked the people to not be distracted by the bread and circus event, claiming that these charities can be restored once independence is secured and that the government is hoping to buy their support by holding their pockets hostage. While their argument is correct, and these organizations can be rebuilt upon independence, their existence now is more of a benefit given that our government can keep these organizations established without any interruption, allowing thousands of people to get immediate access to food, water, after-school care, and countless more needed facilities that our charities so graciously offer."

Though all channels remain nationalized and centralized around the government, the decision to allow these broadcasts was delegated to local authorities within Costa Rica, allowing the President to remain neutral and giving broadcasters across the region the choice of whether to air the documentary. Appealing to the older generation across Costa Rica, the documentary revealed an in-depth analysis of the pre-revolutionary Central American nations, highlighting their corruption and how only through unity were these struggles overcome. With mixed reviews arriving from the populace, with many boycotting what has been deemed as state propaganda, the messages of unity and demands to fight against the resurgence of separatist nationalist rhetoric have seen many begin to reconsider their stances, and given the government a fighting chance to continue gaining the support of the people."

While a realistic and mutually beneficial offer, some believe the demand is nothing more than an attempt by President [CEA.Getleader] to have us remain a member of the Republic despite our newfound independence. Arguing that the restoration of any pre-independence agreement sees our sovereignty immediately trampled on, delegates have requested that the President reject this offer and that Managua return with a more fair and respectful agreement.

Such an agreement has now ensured that we can continue to establish friendly relations with our new neighbor, aiding in their continued transition towards economic independence and avoiding the onset of economic collapse. However, there are some across the Republic who believe that our instigation of friendly relations with Costa Rica is nothing more than a betrayal of the Central American Revolution, calling our willingness to work with those who should rightfully be under our influence a failure of the government to recognize the needs of the people.

Allegedly, our mere suggestion of restoring the Republic’s trade agreements onto San José was the trigger of this disagreement, with their representatives seemingly requesting we establish an entirely new agreement tailored to their independence with provisions included for the President to recognize the economic autonomy of the Costa Rican people. Naturally, we have refused this offer, with the original agreement being an acceptable enough compromise that already accepts the independence of Costa Rica.

With the withdrawal of the peacekeeping forces, responsibilities for the security and safety of Costa Rica are gradually shifting to the newly empowered National Guard and civilian police force. With the ARC and armed forces agreeing to a joint mission to train these new forces, the expectation by both the government and former Costa Rican resistance is that this transition of authority will mark the beginning of a new era of peace and cooperation across the Republic, as demonstrated with the release of the peacekeeping forces from active duty allowing thousands to return to their families with flowers instead of guns."

Now, Desanti has taken it one step further by attempting to bring Figuerism into the mainstream of Central American politics, promising demilitarization of Centroamerican society and greater cooperation with the opposition to pass bipartisan legislation. While Desanti has enormous support in his home region of Costa Rica, it remains to be seen if he can appeal to the wider nation of Central America. \nLastly there is Rigoberta Menchu from Laj Chimel, Honduras. A member of the indigenous K’iche’ people and prolific indigenous rights activist, Menchu has presented herself as an advocate for the indigenous peoples of Central America, who have for a long time been excluded from Central American politics. Many within the party have argued that a candidate such as Menchu would greatly aid in normalizing relations between the FLNC and indigenous communities after their turbulent history with each other. Along with her support amongst indigenous voters, Menchu is also popular with the FLNC’s traditional supporter base of rural peasants and farmers, making her an ideal blend between the old and the new factions of the party. \nFinally, it's time for the party delegates to decide who shall represent the party for the next 4 years."

This is a heavy decision to be made, as the various factions of the party now work tirelessly to get their preferred candidate on the Presidential ticket. \nThe primary candidate is Hugo Martínez from Polorós, El Salvador. Embodying the now dominant reformist wing of the FLNC, Martínez has described himself as the candidate of the workers and peasants. Drawing comparison to previous reformist figures such as Funes and Ulloa, Martínez has experienced widespread support from the various factions of the FLNC. \nFinally, it's time for the party delegates to decide who shall represent the party for the next 4 years."

Now, the once-fragmented region stands mightier than ever, stretching from Mexico in the north to Colombia in the south. With this unification, considerable strategic and military advantages now lay at our feet, including access to vast natural resources, a larger domestic market, and a strengthened geopolitical position. However, while this unification has brought jubilation across the Republic, formidable challenges have now revealed themselves to ParlaCen, bringing almost a near-immediate pause to all celebrations within the halls of government. The integration of infrastructure and industries across such a vast and diverse region is immense, with transport networks and power grids all needing to be recalibrated and trade policies and resource management urgently needing rectification. However, a more immediate and complex issue remains. Across the recently liberated territories, there remains political and social unrest, with our forces often being viewed as the very oppressors that we know we have eradicated from these regions. In Costa Rica, nationalist and extremist sentiment has renewed, sparking similar movements across Guatemala, Panama, and Belize, all demanding to be free from the so-called tyranny of Managua.

Notable contenders in the election included the center-left People’s United Party, the center-right Democratic Change Party, and the incumbent FLNC, who unanimously elected to have Ortega stand for the presidency once more. While liberalization of the state has been evident and widespread, limitations to this democratization have had to be imposed, with parties such as the Guatemalan for Liberty Party facing disqualification due to their perceived stance as anti-Centroamerican. Likewise, other prominent nationalist parties have faced similar disqualification with the electoral commission eager to protect the integrity of the state from those who seek to destroy it. Despite the chance for a course change, the people overwhelmingly voted to return the FLNC to the government, granting the party a near super-majority and re-electing President Ortega in the first round. Much to the delight of the President, the hardliners have now been removed from their seats, suffering a fate worse than arrest as they are now forced to watch as the President begins to cooperate with those they deem as capitalists and reactionaries, fostering stable governance for the first time in decades."

Having owned this land for generations, an agreement was struck with the state that would allow these landowners to retain their land so long as they obeyed the law and refused foreign investment. Despite fiercely opposing our transition towards socialism, this agreement has largely remained intact. However, new evidence has come to light revealing that those targeted in these raids have been generously accepting investment from Mexico, Brazil, and the American Republic, and embezzling state investment for their own purposes. In nearly every state of the Republic, corruption among the landowning class has been steadily increasing, with the President blaming the slow crackdown of these corrupt figures on the lack of evidence that showed where their funds were coming from. With new evidence having recently emerged, and their land now safely in government hands, the reactionary landlords of the Republic have been dealt a significant blow and the people’s trust in the FLNC has seen a significant rise"

With their aim to cut off access to the roads and capture vital areas of the city, a tense and long battle commenced with the armed forces initially on the back foot due to the surprise of the attack. However, thanks to their overwhelming firepower and superior training, our courageous soldiers were able to prevent the insurgents from cutting off the road connecting Quesada to San José, and after an hour of intense fighting on the city outskirts, the insurgents were forced to retreat into the jungles. Shortly after, and much to the relief of the commander stationed there, reinforcements from Aguas Zarcas and Zapote arrived to relieve the weary soldiers. With it evident the insurgent's goal is to establish control over the Alajuela Province before marching on San José, reinforcements have now been supplied with further equipment should an attack come again. Word of this successful defense quickly spread around the country as President Ortega commended the soldiers for their bravery, declaring them heroes of the Republic with even the citizens of Quesada supporting their victory against terrorism."

With tensions already high, police presence was doubled in case either side tried to instigate a fight. However, despite ample preparation, the match could not even start, as C.D. Aguila decided to boycott the event. In a press statement issued later, the team explained that their motivation behind the boycott was the continued violence that Centroamerica has brought upon Costa Rica since the start of the peacekeeping mission. They elaborated by stating that they refuse to play against any Centroamerican team, effectively writing off the remainder of their games for this season. The boycott has caused outrage across the Republic as the three points for this game have been awarded to C.S Herediano to the disappointment of their trainer who argued that this behavior was detrimental to the spirit of the sport."

The aptly named Committee of Three consists of Humberto, and former revolutionaries Luis Carrion Cruz and Henry Ruiz who are all noted for their valuable service to the FLNC. Despite their credentials, and belief that they would be supportive of the President’s recent initiatives to crackdown on corruption, the Committee has instead criticized the arrest of landlords for the supposed mounting evidence suggesting that government officials have been secretly selling the confiscated land to more loyal families rather than nationalizing it. Although unable to present any hard evidence at this current time, this claim has raised significant concerns about the government’s commitment to revolutionary principles. Despite being singled out in the Committee’s report, President Ortega has refrained from commenting on the matter. This reluctance is suspected to be influenced by his familial ties to Humberto, however, it is speculated the two are engaged in heated private discussions."

Originally a member of the Liberal Party of Honduras, Zelaya defected to the FLNC after the 1997 revolution, where he steadily increased his presence within the Honduran branch of the party, ultimately leading to his appointment as mayor. With his predecessor, Matias Funes, resigning weeks ago it was anticipated that President Ortega would oversee the appointment of another of Managua’s loyal and elite party officials, however, in an evident surprise to the people of Tegucigalpa a decision was ultimately taken to appoint Zelaya much to the disappointment of many within the Honduran FLNC who pleaded for a less controversial figure to be appointed. Despite this controversy, President Ortega believes that Zelaya will succeed in his duties as mayor and that in time he will adapt to his new role accordingly and exert the wishes of Managua onto his city. Although his jurisdiction as mayor does not extend beyond the city borders, many party loyalists remain skeptical of the appointment given that the mayorship of the former capital is tantamount to the position of regional leader."

While football enjoys immense popularity in most regions, it has never reached the same level of enthusiasm in Nicaragua, with baseball historically holding the title of the unofficial sport of the nation since its introduction in the 1880s, being played professionally until the late 1960s. In response to this favoritism from the President, Nicaragua’s largest five baseball teams have united to form the Nicaraguan Professional Baseball League, which aims to hold regular seasons and tournaments in the hopes of restoring it to its former glory. While the formation has been scorned by some politicians, who have seen it as nothing more than an attempt to utilize individual nationalistic pride over the unity of the Republic, President Nasralla has publicly praised and encouraged the League for their dedication and passion towards the sport, agreeing to assist in providing financial support to ensure the sport has a thriving first season. Despite the small size of the LBPN, the investment from the government has now encouraged cities and towns from across the region to attempt to revive their defunct teams with hopes for a ten-team league now seemingly a reality so long as the President continues his support."

In their appeal, FLNC leaders have contended that the prohibition is a violation of their members’ rights to political participation and association, which infringes upon the voting rights of millions of socialists across the Republic and, in turn, violates the constitution. While the High Court was initially skeptical to hear these pleads from the party of Ortega, further evidence has been provided that the party has moved on since its initial ban, most notably its leadership highlighting its changes to its party manifesto, which now includes a clear commitment to supporting a multiparty democracy, coupled with a years-long internal purge of the party. As the High Court deliberates on the legal basis for upholding or overturning the ban, the stakes of the outcome remain high given the legal precedent that will be set depending on the outcome. Despite a majority of socialists supporting the end of the ban, the People’s Alliance has instead come out in opposition, fearing that such a revival of their adversary would split the vote in future elections and claiming that the party of Ortega should never again be allowed to become the face of socialism."

With the Farabundo Youth having been long-time advocates of harnessing the power of the atom or utilizing solar energy, many had expected the President to follow a similar trajectory. However, despite this presumption, the President presented an alternative and much more radical proposal. This ambitious project dubbed Proyecto Ciudad Volcán entails constructing thermal energy plants connected to three dormant volcanoes; Conchagua and Chinameca in El Salvador and Cosigüina in Nicaragua. While an insane proposal, the President has been able to successfully sway many to his side, with various scientists backing his proposal, proving the science, and providing the figures necessary for his bill to pass through ParlaCen. However, while the proposal has aimed to capitalize on renewable energy sources, a noble cause that many continue to support and appreciate the President’s ingenuity, concerns about the substantial costs associated with building these advanced facilities, particularly in remote areas, have now been raised. Questioning the feasibility and economic viability of such an endeavor, many representatives have asserted they will vote against the bill."

The project has now encountered substantial delays due to bottlenecks on narrow dirt roads in remote wilderness areas, impeding the movement of workers, machinery, and materials to the construction site. Project leaders are now frantically calling Managua, advocating for additional funds to be allocated toward building proper infrastructure such as roads, storage depots, and temporary housing for workers to address these logistical hurdles. However, as anticipated and seen in the initial vote on the matter, some members of ParlaCen are calling for the project’s abandonment to prevent further cost escalation, while supporters argue that abandoning the project now, after significant investment, would be more wasteful than seeing the project through to completion. Similarly, workers across the Republic have demonstrated their support for the project, seeing the scientific research surrounding the project as evidence enough that the project must be completed to circumvent the seemingly looming energy crisis awaiting the Republic. However, this polling, perhaps intentionally, has not asked the opinion of any citizen living near the construction site, further bringing many to the side of those opposed to the project's completion."

Referred to affectionately as the Three Triplets, these plants are now projected to fulfill over a third of the Republic’s energy requirements based on initial power measurements. However, despite continued support for the projects, residents and environmentalists have continued to oppose the energy plants, citing noise complaints and the potential for an unprecedented environmental disaster. While engineers have assured ParlaCen and the Politburo that these concerns are nothing more than pure speculation and that the thermal plants are more than capable of surviving any natural disaster and have a near zero chance of malfunction, these protests have demonstrated there remains significant work to be done to overcome the doubt surrounding the investment into these works of genius. However, the success of Proyecto Ciudad Volcán has marked a significant milestone in the Republic’s quest for near-total energy independence and has highlighted the potential of innovative approaches to address the pressing energy demands of the nation, leading many to finally accept that despite his youth, the President’s bold and bizarre plans should be heeded to regardless of how insane they sound at first."

Keeping the specifics of the proposal hushed until his allotted time in ParlaCen, it was quickly revealed to the representatives of the Republic that the President desires for Centroamerica to join the international powers among the stars and by launching a satellite into orbit. Despite the challenges associated with such a project, including a lack of theoretical knowledge, Bukele believes that an orbital satellite would not only showcase the Republic’s progress since Hurricane Carlos but also provide practical benefits to our citizens, highlighting its use for the detection of hurricanes. While highlighted mostly for its civilian use, the military has also seen the potential benefits of a satellite system providing their support, so long as adequate funding is diverted to the defense budget. While the proposal has garnered substantial support within ParlaCen, it is yet to be seen whether its representatives will vote in favor, noting that the project alone may end up bankrupting the Republic."

However, despite this containment, the incident has damaged the image of the Agencia de Exploración del Cosmos, raising concerns among skeptics who have continued to advocate the shelving of the program to prevent further waste of resources and a repeat of this disaster. However, the AEC has fired back at its opposition, claiming that every nation that has attempted to touch the heavens has suffered setbacks and the fact that a nation that has never attempted to or had a desire to explore the cosmos has done so without civilian casualties already places it leaps and bounds ahead of NASA and the Kosmicheskaya Programma.

With television stations across the Republic quick to highlight the successes of the President, word has spread to the international community of our achievement, with representatives from multiple states reaching out to congratulate us on this momentous occasion. Likewise, the Politburo has now convened to discuss the future implications for the CENSAT program, with the military now eager to utilize this project for their purposes.

Initially conceived in the 19th century but eclipsed by the construction of the now renowned Panama Canal, this ambitious initiative aims to create a navigable waterway connecting the Caribbean Sea with the Pacific Ocean, cutting through the expanse of Lake Nicaragua. The proposed canal holds promise not only as an attractor for investment from our international communist allies but also as a potential for establishing the Republic as an economic powerhouse, driving trade and maritime traffic to bolster the economy as well as offering a strategic advantage should the Panama Canal ever be blocked to us. However, amidst the grand vision, skepticism looms large, as critics in ParlaCen have questioned the feasibility of the project, raising concerns over its astronomical costs and the potential environmental impact that will occur from our attempts to alter the natural landscape.

The comprehensive assessment highlights concerns over the disruption of vital migration routes, the encroachment on indigenous territories, and the perilous risk of freshwater species extinction due to seawater contamination. In response to this damning report, the Bukele administration has automatically dismissed the findings, accusing the scientific community of exaggerating the potential risks and resorting to fear-mongering tactics to dissuade the advancement of the Republic. However, while the President has dismissed these findings, ParlaCen has taken this report to heart, demanding that Bukele reconsider his initial dismissal. This contentious exchange has now revealed the deep divide between the President and ParlaCen, a union that had previously been assumed to be acting as a united front.

The alarming development has sparked public outrage and raised concerns about the imminent threat to the lake's ecosystem, with experts warning once again of the potential extinction of numerous species. Faced with mounting pressure and public backlash the government has been compelled to swiftly shift its focus toward addressing the unfolding ecological crisis, with President Bukele swiftly placing the blame for this catastrophe onto his scientific advisors, who advised him against supporting the independent report brought before him months ago. Urgent efforts are now underway to mitigate the damage and prevent the further deterioration of Lake Nicaragua’s delicate ecosystem.

The results of the environmental disaster have triggered widespread public opposition, effectively extinguishing support for any revival of the project and dealing a significant blow to President Bukele’s credibility despite his recent shifting of blame to his scientific advisors. As public scrutiny continues to intensify, the President now faces the daunting task of navigating the aftermath of the environmental catastrophe while grappling with its implications for future generations.

With infrastructure being constructed to quicken the transportation of goods and storage facilities being erected along the outskirts of the town, the once-depressed region has now been given a renewed sense of life as thousands have begun to move into the town to oversee its development as a new regional economic hub. While Rivas has seen a renewed sense of life, the other side of the project has been left abandoned, with plans for a port in Punta Gorda scrapped entirely, angering residents who now believe that the government should at least finish their initial investment along the Caribbean. While there are no plans to finish the Punta Gorda port, the investment brought in from the Brito Port will more than certainly be enough to allow for the development on both sides of our glorious Republic."

Whilst a necessity to ensure that the alleged coup planned by Daniel Ortega never comes to fruition, there have been a rapid number of complaints from those within the armed forces who believe the extensive cut to personnel has left the country in a significantly weakened state. Of those removed from their post includes Humberto Ortega, who has been the head of Sandinista Popular Army since its establishment in 1979, similarly Cheif of Staff David Munguía Payés and General Martha Elena Ruiz Sevilla have also been removed from their posts. With several low-ranking generals also being stripped of their rank, the opposition has demanded to know the reason for their dismissal claiming that faulty evidence and political affiliation are unjustifiable reasons to diminish the strength of the armed forces. But this purge has also paved the way for some to quickly climb the ranks, with both general Fredy Díaz Zelaya and René Osorio being promoted to fill the recently made vacancies. This has also not gone over well with the opposition, who have accused Zelaya of replacing one politicized high commande with another, seeing as both generals had recently expressed their support for Zelaya’s democratization. While many defend the action as a necessity, this has no doubt caused further damage to Zelaya's previously perfect image as accusations of the President’s continued descent into authoritarianism continue to garner support among the opposition."

Defending his actions, stating that Managua had failed to protect its citizens from harm, Sunseri demanded that autonomy be granted to Honduras allowing it to act before it was too late. Going further, Sunseri promised that if no response from Managua was heard Honduras should act accordingly and prepare to make its own decisions. These words have echoed across the Republic, with President Ortega inferring this speech as a clear sign of demands for independence something that has been echoed in Tegucigalpa, with Mayor Zeleya remaining eerily silent on the matter."

These newly created autonomies grant self-governance and legal recognition to indigenous communities inhabiting their ancestral lands, providing them with the authority to manage local affairs independently within the national framework. The establishment of these autonomous regions represents a major step toward addressing the long-standing historical grievances of the indigenous population. Some regions, such as Panama’s comarcas indígenas, have been transitioned into formal autonomy, while others have been newly drawn to reflect indigenous lands previously divided by borders between the various Republics. These newly defined territories include the creation of multiple Maya autonomies across Guatemala and Belize, a Lenca autonomy spanning across El Salvador and Honduras, the Miskito autonomy on the eastern coast of Honduras and Nicaragua, and the Ngäbe autonomy, which straddles the border between Costa Rica and Panama. While critics have raised concerns over the challenges that may arise from the implementation of such a complex system of autonomies, raising questions over how these regions will coordinate with the central government, particularly on matters of economic integration, defense, and foreign policy, the promise of an Indigenous council has somewhat abated worries, allowing the government to remain confident in its plans for the future of the original inhabitants of the Republic."

Historically, the PLN was one of the most vocal civilian opposition groups during the Costa Rican occupation, vehemently resisting the efforts of Daniel Ortega to integrate the Republic into Central America, with the two parties clashing repeatedly on issues of sovereignty, social policy, and governance. However, the animosity between the parties has softened in recent months as both sides have sought common ground to address the pressing challenges facing Costa Rica. In a joint statement following the meeting, the FLNC and PLN announced the formation of an electoral alliance aimed at pooling their political capital to advance much-needed social and economic reforms. With the FLNC agreeing to pull its candidates from Costa Rica in areas where the PLN is likely to gain seats, the alliance represents a decisive shift in the political landscape and suggests that both parties are finally able to recognize the need for cooperation despite their historic animosity. With a wave of optimism now spreading across Costa Rica, regionalist parties have rejoiced at this decision, seeing the possibilities of gaining a similar agreement with the FLNC in the future to promote the regional interests of the Republic while maintaining its unity."

This electoral alliance aims to consolidate leftist forces to promote socialist reforms at a time when nationalist and anti-socialist sentiment has seen a considerable rise across the Republic. The formation of the GCI marks a significant effort to build a united front against these growing influences and ensure that the spirit of anti-Ortegaism, anti-fascism, and anti-authoritarianism survives within the socialist movements of Central America. The announcement of the GCI has not come as a surprise, given that other well-established political factions, such as Civic Action and the National Party, have similarly absorbed or allied with local parties in the regions now part of the Republic. What sets the Grand Left Coalition apart, however, is the decision by the FLNC not to pursue the more traditional path of subsuming smaller leftist groups, as was often the case historically, in which the ideological forbearer of the FLNC, the FSLN, absorbed entities like the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front in El Salvador and the Democratic Unification Party in Honduras. This move to create an alliance, rather than further absorb smaller parties, has signaled a clear indication that the FLNC has moved towards the recognition that it cannot, and does not, stand alone in representing the workers of the Republic, now emphasizing Winaq’s Indigenous platform and the People’s United Front’s strong grassroots movement among blue-collar workers."

Justifying the decision by citing the historical tendency for military power to give rise to strongmen, the drastic reduction has seen nearly seventy-five percent of the military budget slashed to break the cycle that has long given rise to dictators who had promised everything yet granted nothing. As anticipated, opposition figures have been quick to criticize the law, with some accusing the government of leaving the nation vulnerable to external threats and domestic instability. According to these same representatives, this downsizing could invite opportunistic actors to exploit the perceived weakness of the Republic’s defenses. The reality, however, appears more nuanced. Under the new framework, military service will no longer be mandatory, marking a sharp departure from the previous system that required compulsory enlistment. Instead, local police forces are expected to take on many of the responsibilities once held by the army, with only a small core of voluntary recruits retained as part of an elite defense force. Yet, despite this radical transformation, the law has included an important caveat stating that in the event of war, the restrictions on military size and scope can be temporarily lifted, allowing for the rapid re-expansion of the armed forces if needed. With such a law untested throughout the history of the Republic, only time will tell if the redirected funding will be a benefit to the nation or if it will soon cause the end of the Central American Revolution."

Entrepreneurs in these areas are rapidly expanding their operations to keep pace with demand, and new businesses are sprouting up, creating a dynamic local economy fueled by the transit of people and goods. At the same time, new housing developments are emerging, as many workers who cross regional borders for employment are seeking affordable living arrangements closer to their workplaces, without having to be too far from their families. While it is still early days, this unforeseen economic expansion has raised hopes for sustained growth in these border communities, which historically have been less economically active compared to other urban centres.

The CCAC clearly defines how civil servants should perform their duties, with a strong emphasis on transparency, impartiality, and the avoidance of personal gain through the office. Violations of this code will be met with severe consequences, including termination of employment and the potential for prosecutive under the Republic’s anti-corruption laws. President [CEA.GetLeader] has presented the CCAC as a critical step in building a robust and corruption-free civil service and while some have criticized the CCAC as a confusing set of regulations that does little to set itself apart from existing legislation, the President has ensured that the new legislation is vastly different honing in on the new announcement that any gift offered or presented to a civil servant must be declared to the government rather than merely rejected. Such an announcement has, however, brought forward significant opposition, with many claiming that this legislation will do no more than turn civil servants into sniffer dogs for corruption when the gift may be as simple as a pair of socks.

Critics of the government, especially from the [CEA.GetCentristParty], have lambasted the President’s decision and accused them of using the executive order to strategically place loyalists in key regional positions, arguing that, rather than a fair reinstatement, this is an effort to consolidating power, and have called for fresh mayoral and regional elections instead.

The PCA has attributed this explosive growth to the government’s aggressive efforts to attract foreign investment and bolster trade relations within other capitalist states, who have been more than willing to engage with trade now that the canal is receiving the care and support it needs. Policies aimed at integrating foreign markets and offering favorable conditions for international shipping have seemingly paid off, allowing the canal to reclaim its critical position in global trade routes.

The statue, standing proudly in the heart of the capital, honors the 19th-century revolutionary who played a pivotal role in the early struggles for Central American independence and unity. Born in 1778 as the illegitimate son of a Spanish captain and an unknown woman of African descent, Ordóñez rose to prominence when he led a revolt against the pro-Mexican governor of Nicaragua, seizing power and ruling Nicaragua as Supreme Chief from 1824 to 1825. Despite his brief rule, Ordóñez has become a symbol of defiance against foreign influence and conservative forces, notably clashing with President Manuel José Arce. Imprisoned for his resistance, Ordóñez soon led the banner of liberalism and unionism during the First Central American Civil War, making him a controversial yet significant figure in our region’s history. Despite critics voicing concerns over the honoring of a Caudillo, the government has defended the tribute and the man as an inspiring influence for all seeking to oppose tyranny, imperialism, and oligarchs, stating that his vision of a united and free Republic is a cause that many still uphold today. While accepting this defense, it has become increasingly concerning why the government has refused to sanction the construction of other figures from that period of our Republic’s history who fought and died for the same ideals as Ordóñez."

Rising to prominence as a fierce opponent of President Manuel José Arce, Morazán stood in the Battle of La Trinidad in 1827, which soon marked a turning point in the First Central American Civil War, leading to his rise as a leader for the liberal side of the conflict. As a figure of instrumental reform such as freedom of press, freedom of speech, and in general liberating the people of the Republic from the shackles of autocracy, President [CEA.GetLeader] has once again called on the citizens of the Republic to take Morazan work to heart and work for a truly progressive Republic. While some have challenged the nature of this ceremony, seeing the President’s gathering as a confusing and unnecessary waste of state resources, [CEA.GetLeader] has been quick to assert the necessity of the people to learn of its national heroes to better understand themselves and the direction it will walk into the the twenty-first century. Yet, having cherry-picked various Caudillos throughout history, representatives of ParlaCen and citizens are now beginning to question this supposed historical revisionism, and whether or not the President and Civic Action see themselves as the continuation of these great heroes and their legacy."

With the eyes of the police services, and intelligence agencies turned against all suspected wrongdoings, the President has suggested even targeting the FLNC and National Liberation Party, further fueling tensions within ParlaCen. Comparisons to America’s red scare have already been made by Civic Action and the FLNC who have decried this aggressive rhetoric as unhelpful and divisive.

These Caudillos, known for their brutality and tight control over Central America, have, according to the government, never been viewed through an overly critical lens, with the President arguing that history has been far too unkind to these continuously demonized leaders. Among those pardoned are, for now, Guatemala's Jorge Ubico and El Salvador’s Maximiliano Hernández Martínez, two figures long criticized for their authoritarian regimes. As expected, the decision has sparked outrage across the political spectrum, especially on the left, with the most contentious pardon being granted to the infamous Somoza family, who were toppled at the end of the Sandinista Revolution in 1975. The pardon of figures like Anastasio Somoza García and his descendants has now only further fanned the fuels of resistance on the streets, with FLNC’s representatives demanding the President overturn his decision which is an affront to the descendants of the Sandinista Revolution. The news of these pardons has also apparently reached Anastasio Somoza Portocarrero, the son of former President Anastasio Somoza Debayle, who now is reportedly in discussions with the government to lift his exile and allow him to return to his home country. While these discussions are in the early stages and are likely to take time, his return would be a stunning reversal of the legacy of the FLNC and the country’s struggle with its own history."

Operating primarily in Honduras, Nicaragua, and El Salvador, Los Sin Miedo is known for its involvement in the manufacturing and distribution of Class A narcotics, with it now evident that the gang is seeking to expand itself into the new regions of Central America, igniting turf wars with local established gangs. The wave of violence has left residents in the hardest-hit areas terrified, with community activities voicing concerns over the government’s lack of response, accusing regional authorities of turning a blind eye to Los Sin Miedo’s activities. Some have even gone as far as to suggest that the government is tactile favoring the larger, more organized gang over smaller, local criminal outfits in the hopes of consolidating the drug trade under a more centralized cell- a charge that local officials and the President have vehemently denied. In response to growing public outrage, regional governments have pledged to crack down on all forms of organized crime, emphasizing that no group will be spared from prosecution. However, with community activists' voices only growing louder and deaths from drug overdoses only increasing, the promises by regional administrators are yet to be delivered, all the while control over local communities slips from Managua’s grasp."

The march, which began at ParlaCen and concluded at John Paul II Faith Square, was purportedly held to inspire a sense of national pride and a shared sense of duty, patriotism, and honor among all citizens who watched the march live on state media channels. As the crowds surged through the capital, chants such as “God, Fatherland, Centroamerica” and “Down with red tyrants” echoed all around, drawing immense support and criticism from those watching on in adoration and horror. The opposition has been quick to condemn the march claiming it to be laced with the National Alliance’s ideology in an attempt to entwine their leadership with Central America’s national identity. With the most vocal of critics daring to suggest that these marches were nothing short of the dawn of fascism in the Republic, the organizers of these events have heralded them as a success, with over sixty percent favoring the marches and agreeing with their messaging. As the spectre of communism now dies in our Republic, a national rebirth has begun, one that will forever hold onto the ideals of these marches, one that will never again allow weak-willed men to permit the Republic to fall into the hands of those who seek to destroy it, and one that will forever dedicate itself to the slogans chanted in Managua."

The opening of the museum has already drawn hundreds of thousands of visitors on its inaugural day, reflecting a widespread eagerness to delve into the collective heritage of our now-shared region. Encouraged by these enthusiastic responses, plans are underway to establish similar museums across the Republic, ensuring widespread access to this invaluable repository of historical knowledge.

However, as noted by those arrested, the Youth League members have been quietly escorted back to their respective regions, with many now claiming that there is no justice under the rule of President Ortega.

While facing opposition from the FLNC, with hardline communists and socialists branding the reforms as a move towards authoritarian capitalism, President Ortega has defended them as essential to the economic reconstruction of the Republic, drawing parallels to Lenin’s New Economic Policy. Despite being challenged on this matter, with party members arguing Lenin’s NEP failed and that it was only through Stalin’s industrialization programs that the Soviet Union became an economic titan, Ortega has insisted that there are significant differences between the Soviet Union of the 1930s and Central America allowing for a more open and market-oriented system. To alleviate these concerns, Ortega has assured that foreign investors will undergo rigorous government screening, although specific criteria has remained undisclosed. With bustling debate filling the halls of ParlaCen and the Politburo, the reforms have now passed by a reasonable majority, with opposition being voiced only due to the reluctance to publish the criteria for investment."

With his appointment being met with mixed responses in ParlaCen, with many questioning why he should be appointed to the Foreign Ministry at all, Cardenal addressed his fellow representatives, presenting himself as a bridge between the religious and socialist worlds, arguing that they were both united in their commitments to protecting the poor just as Christ had done and that through his balance of both the Republics international presence would be secured. While this speech received resounding applause from the conservative sections of the party, a minority of members of the party have rejected the appointment, seeing it as an attempt by the President to undermine years of tireless efforts to root out the opiate from the Republic entirely. While an understandable criticism, Cardenal represents the next stage of the Republic’s evolution towards socialism, with the President seeing that his goals of a secular Republic were always going to be littered with a path of destruction.

With the Youth Leagues having recently proven their worth to the Republic, following a series of continued assaults against President Ortega’s government, in which its membership demonstrated a keen willingness to preserve the revolutionary leadership of Ortega, this appointment has been viewed by many as a reward to the Youth Leagues marking the culmination of their efforts over the last few months. However, while the appointment has satisfied the Youth League, the decision has been noted by many as an attempt to sideline members of the Old Guard within the party and the military. In his inaugural address, Minister Ruiz declared that the Youth Leagues had remained loyal to the Central American Revolution while all others had faltered, expressing that the dedication shown by the Farabundo Youth should set the standard for all other revolutionary activity by representatives in ParlaCen and across the Republic. Decrying the silence of so-called loyalists in all parts of the country, Ruiz, seemingly with the authorization of the President, proclaimed that the old order would now be swept aside, torn down from its pedestal, and replaced by new leadership. As a mass purge of officials is now carried out at the behest of Ortega, the revolution has now reached its apex with the Leagues guiding the revolution forward, and President Ortega is now finally satisfied he will be remembered as the savior of the Republic."

Unanimously elected to the position, Monestel declared that his appointment had now secured the Republic from the lingering threat posed by reactionary forces that had been able to slowly integrate themselves within the FLNC. Branding his predecessor as an Ortega loyalist, Monestel demanded that ParlaCen pass the original PCT plan which would ensure that the reactionaries in the streets and still in government could be dealt with.

However, this concession has come with a crucial caveat; participating parties must refrain from advocating for the separation of their respective regions from the Republic. While staunchly rejected by far-right factions, moderate nationalist groups like Guatemalans for Liberty have embraced the proposal, signaling a willingness to engage constructively within the political framework. Despite being denounced as controlled opposition by their separatist peers, the acceptance of these terms by moderates has brought an end to the worst clashes on the streets, with far-right groups now continuing to lose legitimacy as they shift their target from street protests to arson in the hopes of strengthening their position against the government.

The new measures are designed to nurture the growth of smaller political parties by ensuring that they receive equitable campaign funding from a government-administered fund, with the allocation of these funds based on the number of seats a party holds in regional or national elections with specific exceptions for parties currently in government. While some have branded this as unfair, and arguing it gives too much power to the opposition, the President has insisted that this is the point, as the exclusion is designed to prevent the entrenchment of established parties. Although the immediate impact of these anti-particratic measures may not be felt at the national level immediately, their effect is expected to be more pronounced in regional elections, with the new funding model proving to be more than enough to allow groups such as the People’s Alliance to begin a renewed electoral campaign.

Unlike before, in which the party had benefited from maintaining relations with the international socialist community, the new doctrine of the FLNC has stated that it will no longer keep ties with socialist states that have not or will not, transition towards civilian-ruled democracy.

While most feminist movements have appreciated the commencement of this program, some have argued it has failed to address the root causes of these issues, calling for a doubling of funding to the program to ensure that this announcement becomes more than a mere pat on the back for the government.

The Suyapa Order, as it has quickly become known, is named after the revered Virgin of Suyapa, the patroness of Honduras, with the role of the order being to serve in various Latin American countries, providing aid to impoverished communities and disseminating the teachings of Jesus Christ. While the government has lauded the move as a reflection of the the Republic's deep Christian heritage, critics have been quick to accuse the administration of leveraging the order for political influence, suggesting that the order is serving as a soft-power tool and that is charitable efforts have been intertwined with subtle political messaging, blurring the lines between religious outreach and statecraft. In response to these accusations, government officials have defended the establishment of the order, claiming that the President would never seek to subvert the word of God for political purposes and promising that the order is about faith, not politics. While many remain skeptical, the order has been working valiantly to bring Christ's word to the Republic and abroad with many of society's downtrodden attending their education and healthcare services."

 centroamerica.266.d:0 "Organized crime in the Republic has today faced a significant setback as the National Police launched a series of coordinated raids last night, targeting cartel and gang strongholds across the country. These operations, which resulted in the arrest and death of several high-profile criminal leaders, are seen as a direct response to the recent surge in gang violence that has claimed numerous civilian lives. While this crackdown has weakened some of the country’s strongest and most notorious criminal networks, the fight against organized crime is far from over, as various influential cartels and gangs continue to operate largely unimpeded. Despite its claims of successfully dealing a decisive blow to local gangs and cartels throughout their tenure, these raids have exposed the deep entrenchment of criminal organizations within the Republic’s social and economic fabric as the total arrested now reaches over five-hundred. To make the situation worse, and adding to conspiracy theories that the gangs are being allowed to operate freely, influential gang leader Hugo Armando Quinteros-Mineros was found dead in his cell reportedly from suicide after being found with three stab wounds to the chest and one to the throat after complaining to his lawyer that he had been stabbed in the back by the government. Acknowledging these conspiracies before they get out of hand, President [CEA.GetLeader] has stated that Mineros was acting as an undercover informant for their operations with his arrest taking place to ensure his safety, however, it appears that such information had leaked to the gangs who have swiftly taken revenge."

 centroamerica.267.d:0 "Since the government announced the creation of the Zones for Employment and Economic Development as part of a broader effort to attract investment into underdeveloped regions of the Republic, one project has garnered significant attention from both local and international investors: the Próspera Model City. Serving as the flagship for the ZEDE program, Próspera aims to transform a previously underutilized area into a hub of trade, innovation, and economic growth. The spotlight on Próspera has now only intensified as news broke that Porfirio Lobo Sosa has been appointed Technical Secretary of the project by a special committee. While largely unknown to the broader public, Sosa has deep ties to the National Alliance, having long been a member of the movement following the seizure of his family’s agricultural business by Sandinista forces. Critics have cited nepotism in his appointment, seeing his ties to President [CEA.GetLeader] as the only reason for his nomination, others have long expected the appointment owing to his knowledge of agricultural development strategies and urban planning. Following a meeting with the President, Sosa has now begun to utilize his newfound power by firing all members of his staff and having them replaced with his recommended officials, further signifying a radical change is beginning within the Model City project. However, with more progress being made on the project since its announcement, these appointments have largely been overlooked as the President remains satisfied knowing they have made the right decision."

Arriving in the frost-covered capital, Ortega met various representatives, ministers, and foreign leaders who all shared the same sorrow. After mingling with leaders from Europe to Asia, the President and his wife were guided to the procession which was being recorded and broadcast internationally. Standing behind the exiled General Secretary of Yemen, Ali Salem al-Beidh, Ortega carried a handful of roses holding his wife's hand as tightly as he could. Arriving at the Kremlin Wall Necropolis, the pair sat and listened as Leonid Khabarov, Dmitry Kozak, and Eduard Shevardnadze spoke on the heroism that Yazov displayed throughout his tenure. By the day's end, Ortega boarded his plane and began the long trip back to Managua, contemplating the passing of this revolutionary titan and whether he would be remembered as fondly by his people once he is called to his final rest."

Arriving at Miraflores Palace shortly after he touched down, Ortega was shuffled to his new home in Maracay, where he shall be guarded twenty-four hours a day and granted a pension from the [CEA.GetName]. With it clear that Ortega is still recovering from his brief imprisonment and trial, the former President is now reported to be writing his memoirs, where he has informed his guards he shall detail the truth of what occurred in Central America and how the reactionaries undermined his authority and stabbed him in the back to reverse over a decade of socialism."

The so-called Coalition of Freedom, as named by the pair during a collaborative press conference, aims to enfranchise those who feel they have been left behind by the divisive politics of the United Opposition and those who refuse to support the President’s continued descent into authoritarianism. Agreeing to withdraw candidates from constituencies where their coalition partner is likely to succeed, the agreement has seemingly bolstered the chances of Nasralla becoming President of the Republic. However, this coalition is anything but a desperate attempt by the two parties to secure a reasonable victory for their movements. With Nasralla failing to pick up meaningful momentum following the formation of his party, and Alemán’s Constitutional Liberals hemorrhaging support to the United Opposition, only time will tell if this new alliance will pay off or, if as expected by many, it will be a short-lived agreement doomed to only further secure the majorities of other leading parties."

As our new allies begin to send their delegates to Managua, discussion has already begun surrounding the immediate breakdown of all existing trade barriers between our nations, with some delegates even suggesting that the representatives should immediately adapt the successful framework of the European Union’s Constitution to fit the circumstances of our governments and the plight of the Caribbean and Latin American proletariat."

However, when pushed about the truth of this statement, our ambassadors were unable to answer why we had not pursued this bloc sooner, arguing that Cuba’s fall to capitalism had opened a door to our dominance as the leading socialist state in the region. Rejecting all further diplomacy on the matter and hoping that other states will reject our supposed attempt to steer the course of socialism's future in the region, our attention has now turned back to the continued promotion of the SSF with President [CEA.Getleader] hoping this setback will not deal a decisive blow to the future of this ambitious project."

Despite having a reasonable excuse for their refusal, the SSF Council has made it clear from the conception of the idea of the SSA that exceptions would be made to this rule depending on the economic circumstances of member states, making it clear there is a deeper reason for their refusal beyond their financial concerns.

Nayib Bukele, the disgraced youth leader turned Minister of Education for the Mayor of El Salvador, has now been sworn in as an official member of the Central Committee, legalizing his candidacy for President. Bukele’s sudden advancement through the ranks of the FLNC has been attributed to the influence of César Ham and Joaquín Villalobos, two established figures within the Politburo, who have now invited the newest member of the Central Committee to speak once more in front of the President to announce his intentions. Returning to the same place where his career was thought to be over, Bukele lambasted Ortega, denouncing his failing policies and proclaiming that neither he nor his brother was capable enough to continue the Central American Revolution into the twenty-first century, claiming both to be unimaginative elder statesmen who have clung to the past to try and solve modern solutions. Promising to beat both in the upcoming Politburo vote, the President ordered Ham, Villalobos, and their adopted son to leave the chamber, deeming their backing for this upstart to be a betrayal of the highest order."

However, with this expected result having never arrived, the novice has now seemingly once more clutched hold of the reins of political power, having secured the nomination for the Mayorship of Nuevo Cuscatlan, a small municipality in the city of El Salvador. With this nomination having come out of the blue and Daniel Ortega loyalists decrying this selection as a betrayal of the revolution, attempting to cite his lack of ParlaCen membership once more as justification enough for his deselection, Mayor Bukele has swept aside these criticisms pointing to the celebrations by the people, and students, of Nuevo Cuscatlan as evidence that he is welcomed to the role of mayor. Despite this apparent downgrade in position from his presidential aspirations, Mayor Bukele appears committed to serving his community and continuing to cultivate grassroots support, already reaching out to the Farabundo Youth to fill his cabinet. From a disgraced youth leader to a failed presidential candidate to the newest mayor in the Republic, only time will tell if the unpredictable nature of politics leaves Bukele here or if another twist of fate awaits this seemingly indispensable politician."

With his ejection being attributed to his efforts to undermine the government, inciting the nation’s youth to act against the President and attempting to seize power for himself, the once more disgraced youth leader has only avoided a lengthy jail sentence thanks to his promises to remain under constant government surveillance, serve a three-year ban on political engagement, excluding voting, and serving as an independent politician should he wish to return to politics following the end of the three-year ban. Denouncing the Farabundo Youth Wing, Bukele has now joined his allies Salvador Sánchez Cerén, César Ham, and Joaquín Villalobos, who were granted similar sentences, in political limbo, uncertain of where their careers can go following their expulsion. With loyalists to Ortega now filling the places of Bukele’s backers, it seems as though the President has secured his grip over the country with the optimism of the youth for a brighter future now fading away entirely, emboldening their resolve against the government."

In an interview with the state press, Alemán aired his grievances with Hernández citing concerns about his radical Christian ideology, arguing that while it has successfully revitalized the right and brought hope that Christ can return to Managua, his rhetoric and willingness to engage with extremist elements poses a significant threat to the nations young democracy. Simultaneously, Hernández has taken the opportunity to express his frustrations during one of his rallies, condemning Alemán as a coward unwilling to champion the rights of Catholics and uphold traditional family values. While it is uncertain what caused this sudden and dramatic split within the right, rumors have begun to circulate that Alemán instigated the collapse of the coalition following his demands that guarantees be made that Hernández would not seek to amend the constitution. With the two parties now going their separate ways, the political schism left in the wake of this departure has only benefited Hernández, with Alemán’s supporters now desperate to find a way to stop hemorrhaging support and reclaim their position as the voice of the right."

Despite hopes for a landslide victory by the President, Civic Action has now been forced into a lengthy campaign to defend Zelaya’s record and fight against the accusation asserted by Nasralla that he benefitted, monetarily, from the FLNC’s corruption. Likewise, the United Opposition has faced scathing criticism from Nasralla, who has refuted the candidacy of Hernández, arguing that it would be foolish for the nation to jump from one side of extremism to the other.

Labeling the new democratic government as a direct continuation of the Ortega era, the ACR has accused the National Liberation Party of Costa Rica of collaboration with the government due to their recent participation in the Constitutional Convention in Managua. Despite their radical stances, most notably their acceptance of violent methods to achieve independence, the Alliance of Costa Rican Resistance holds considerable sway across the region, with it likely that their word could spark the onset of a mass insurrection unless the government acted accordingly. Faced with the resurgence of insurgency, President [CEA.Getleader] has declared, to buy their government time, that the government will begin addressing the situation in Costa Rica before it acts on its electoral promises. While this has gained the support of the National Liberation Party and the majority of Costa Ricans, the ACR remains on high alert, with the military standing by in case conflict erupts."

Although having previously pledged to never engage in diplomacy or negotiations with the government, ARC has now seemingly been forced to the table following the onset of a mass exodus of its membership to its sister organization, the Free Costa Rican Movement, setting in stone the continued deterioration of peace in Costa Rica. Refusing to pardon the organization entirely, President [CEA.Getleader] has now issued a pardon to large swathes of the organization's membership, so long as they agree to hand over their weapons and be placed on house arrest for the foreseeable future. Forced to agree with these demands, Cespedes and other senior leadership have borne the brunt of Managua’s fury, with their punishment being lifetime house arrest following a short two-year sentence in maximum security prison. However, this agreement has been far from popular within ARC, as its membership continues to defect to the Free Costa Rican Movement, denouncing Cespedes as a traitor to Costa Rica and beginning preparations for the continued struggle against Managua."
 centroamerica.298.d.b:0 "In a significant development, Walter Muños Cespedes, the longtime leader of the Alliance of Costa Rican Resistance, has announced the disbandment of the organization, citing the results of the recent referendum as proof that his methods were no longer welcomed in securing Costa Rican independence and that the days of resistance were behind him. Expressing a keen interest to instead work within the new democratic system, Cespedes declared that once the state had cleared him and he was no longer considered a threat to the Republic’s safety, he would return to Costa Rican politics under the banner of the National Liberation Party, his former political affiliation. With the ARC agreeing with his assessment of the situation and following his lead, it seems as though fears of a terrorist insurrection in Costa Rica are beginning to fade. However, while ARC has agreed to step down and reform itself, little has been heard from the Free Costa Rican Movement, who are, according to intelligence reports, more than prepared to continue the armed struggle against the government. Yet, with no official confirmation of this, all the nation can do is wait until this radical cell makes its next move."

However, despite security services having prepared an extensive list of targets that needed to be monitored, overseeing rapid expansion of the military presence near the Costa Rican border, and preparing local police for terrorist strikes, these fears have now been quelled today as Pinto announced that the Free Costa Rican Movement would begin the process of reformation striving to establish itself as a political party. Much like Cespedes, Pinto has agreed to be monitored by the state to ensure they can be satisfied with the transformation of the former terrorist organization and has agreed to participate in both community service and weapon recalls to ensure his organization poses no threat to the reformed state. Although his sudden change of heart is encouraging for the future, ParlaCen has now engaged in fierce debate over whether it will be acceptable, or even legal, to allow an openly fascist group to operate within Costa Rica and potentially stand in elections."
 centroamerica.299.d.b:0 "While Alberto Pinto vowed to continue the fight against the Republic, promising to fight until the last drop of Costa Rican blood, his continued resistance was not meant to be. Just a little over a week since his ascension as the sole leader of the Costa Rican Resistance movement, with the Alliance of Costa Rican Resistance being absorbed by its fascistic sister organization, Pinto and the vast majority of the Free Costa Rican Movement’s leadership have been captured in a successful raid executed by counter-terrorism units in Limon. Having been tipped off to his location following the defection of one Costa Rican, who has now been arrested and may be granted pardon for his heroism, Pinto and his company were caught off-guard planning their relocation to the Veragua Rainforest. Unable to offer any resistance to the police and counter-terrorism units, the fascists have now been arrested and taken to Managua, where a speedy trial will charge them with treason and sentence them to death. With the capture of Pinto, the highest-ranking official left in the Costa Rican independence movement, it is hoped by the National Police that any remaining terrorist cells will fall into disarray and those who do not will easily be uncovered from their hiding place where will be tried and face a similar fate to their leaders."

For most of its history, ARC has been supported in arms and manpower by an unidentified mercenary group of American origin, which has made up most of its elite forces and proved to be responsible for training the rebels, explaining the failures of peacekeeping operations following the 2006 referendum. However, despite intense interrogation of terrorists who refused to betray the Costa Rican cause, the identity of this organization continues to elude the National Police. Even now, following reports of American vessels sitting silently off the coast of Nicaragua, identification is impossible. With a manhunt ongoing for any American mercenaries across Costa Rica or the many jungles of the Republic, the only lead remains witness reports in the east, which have reported ships in the middle of the night carrying men and cargo out of the country seemingly to never return. If this is the case, and the American mercenaries are now leaving the nation, the threat of a new generation of rebellions has ended.

Three minutes into injury time, a victor was finally declared after Alajuelense managed to score a penalty, securing their win, as mere seconds later, the referee blew the whistle for full time.

The objective of this meeting was to persuade Mairena and his organization to collaborate with the new Ortega administration by demonstrating that the times of corruption have ended with the collapse of Daniel’s authority over the FLNC. Although Maierna voiced his backing for President Ortega’s land reform initiatives, both Ramirez and Ruiz are aware of the vast ideological differences between the President and the MAC’s leader, with the latter diverting significantly from Sandinista principles. As a result, while pressure has been placed on the two ministers to ensure the loyalty of the MAC, President Ortega has agreed to allow the two to abandon the pursuit of the alliance should they deem the alliance to be untenable, based on their ongoing meetings. Having already demonstrated a refusal to cooperate with the President on land reform, it is evident that any alliance will be forced into compromise and could hinder our ability to pursue the Sandinista revolution to its fullest extent."

Led by César Ham, the Renovators are renowned for their reformist stances within the FLNC, although they have historically faced resistance within the party ranks, with much of its leadership being branded as eccentric firebrands incapable of compromise. Ham, who has maintained a low profile following his strange and unsuccessful venture with the failed presidential candidate Nayib Bukele, has now openly endorsed President Ortega and his proposed democratic reforms, seemingly ready to abandon his opposition to the Ortega name overnight. How committed he is to these new principles can only remain to be seen, as such a dramatic shift in political allegiance has been taken with a pinch of salt by the President and the rest of the FLNC who are equally confused by this drastic change in opinion. While alliances such as these are undoubtedly valuable amidst the turbulent dynamics of the Politburo, the extent to which President Ortega is willing to engage with a figure like Ham, known for and continuously demonstrating his opportunistic tendencies, remains uncertain."

The primary objective behind this proposed coalition is to counterbalance the influence wielded by loyalists to former President Ortega within ParlaCen, as even now, the House remains in a state of fluidity with no faction able to say with certainty that they control the main chamber of government. However, within Humberto’s cabinet, there exists a palpable hesitancy towards aligning too closely with overt reformists such as César Ham and his Renovators, with ministers advocating for a more cautious approach, suggesting that the Renovators could be directed to collaborate on critical constitutional amendments while maintaining ambiguity regarding the possibility of a formal coalition. While this strategic maneuver would begin to shift the balance of ParlaCen back into the hands of the President, there are more capable and reliable alliances that could be made to ensure our dominance within the FLNC, and various ministers are concerned that it would only be a matter of weeks before Ham’s allegiances change once more."

With it unknown who struck first, both divisions of the EPC and TPU have now been sanctioned, pending a further investigation.

Adding to the complexity of the situation, both the high command and the TPU have refrained from punishing soldiers involved in the brawls, with all previous sanctions ended, effectively meaning that whoever the President sides with will end up bearing the blame for the incident. While President Ortega possesses the authority to quash this issue once and for all and silence the military, doing so risks accusations of favoritism towards the TPU, reminiscent of past perceptions of the military’s alignment with the previous Ortega government, a comparison Humberto is eager to avoid.

This sentiment has stemmed from observations made by Cesar Ham that the majority of high ministerial positions have been occupied by individuals solely from Nicaragua, while those from the other Republics are left behind, appointed only should the need to appease the minister in question arise. To rectify this favoritism, Ham has proposed the immediate appointment of Salvadorian FLNC member Cristina Cornejo to the position of deputy foreign minister. Renowned for her extensive experience as a youth leader, Cornejo has been viewed as a potential asset to Foreign Minister Tinico, believing she would offer fresh perspectives and help rejuvenate the foreign office. However, Cornejo’s known reformist stances have brought some pause to the President, who believes that her immediate appointment would only strengthen the Renovators and potentially shift the nation's foreign policy away from its current trajectory.

 centroamerica.316.d:0 "Amid the demise of the Electoral Reform Bill in ParlaCen, allies of President Ortega have now tabled an alternative solution to address the pressing issues gripping the Republic, following on from their demands to increase presidential powers. Arguing that the nation is entrenched in a state of emergency thanks to the recent completion of the revolution and Renovators seeking to undermine the party, hardliners have now pushed forward the National Recovery Bill, which would grant the President sweeping emergency powers to effectively navigate this crisis. Having garnered near unanimous support from loyalists to the President and the various hardliners within ParlaCen, the bill quickly passed through the legislative branch, even gaining favor from selected members of the Renovators who have recognized the need for some piece of legislation to pass to ensure that the Republic does not crumble under the weight of the completion of the revolution. As a result, President Ortega has been bestowed with emergency powers by a resounding majority within ParlaCen, making him the most powerful executive the Republic has ever had, with many comparing the supposedly moderate leader to his brother."

Stressing the imperative of unity to safeguard the revolutionary ideals embodied by the great liberator, Sandino, Ortega positioned himself as the definitive continuation of the vanguard of the ongoing Centroamerican Revolution. While some of our newer allies were hesitant to initially agree to this comparison, the success of the revolution have been undoubtable and, following brief negotiations, Ortega and the party leaders emerged united, with our new allies pledging their unwavering support to Humberto Ortega and the cause of the Centroamerican Revolution. This public pledge of loyalty to the FLNC and, more importantly, to President Ortega has ensured that as the revolution advances into the future we as a nation shall advance hand in hand, never again to be divided by the reactionaries that seek to undo the culmination of Sandino’s century long struggle for the liberation of our united peoples."

Though the FLNC’s constitution does not formally outline a clear line of succession for the event in which the President dies, Vice President and Second Secretary Luis Carrión Cruz has stepped in to temporarily assume the President’s duties. The news has left the nation on edge, with no updates from the hospital as of yet. Meanwhile, despite portraying party unity, political intrigue has begun to swirl among the vestiges of Daniel Ortega’s loyalists, who now see this as a chance to reassert their influence within the party should the worst come to pass. With the eyes of the nation anxiously fixed on the front doors of Dr. Alejandro Dávila Bolaños Military Hospital, the Republic is bracing itself for what could be a defining moment in its political history, regardless of whether the President survives or not."

The aging revolutionary, who had suffered a heart attack caused by a sudden spike in stress and compounded by a blockage in his right ventricle, was met with thunderous applause upon his return to ParlaCen. Flanked by his team of doctors, who he wished to have applauded, the President appeared healthy and composed, giving the impression of a man who, despite having avoided death, would continue to lead until his dying days. However, the relief of Ortega’s recovery was soon met with shock as the President made an unexpected and historic announcement. Believing his age and recent health scare to be signs that his time in office should come to an end, Ortega tendered his resignation as President of the Republic and General Secretary of the FLNC, declaring Second Secretary and Vice President Luis Carrión Cruz as his natural successor. Despite murmurs of dissent from loyalists of former President Daniel Ortega, the motion passed unanimously, and in a dramatic and emotional ceremony, Humberto oversaw the swearing-in of Cruz as the third President of Central America, with renowned comandante Dora María Téllez taking up the mantle as Vice President. Nevertheless, despite Humberto pledging to remain active as a guiding figure for President Cruz, Ortega’s exit from the political stage has left several unanswered questions. While his retirement has set a powerful precedent for the orderly transition of power, his inability to secure an amendment to the party’s constitution codifying this succession has left President Cruz in a precarious situation. Unless Cruz can carefully guide the FLNC forward, his leadership, or his choice of successor, may soon be challenged by any of the various factions of the FLNC."

However, during the meetings, the leaders of the communist parties agreed that any merger with the FLNC must come with guarantees of political sway over the direction of the party either through the expansion of ParlaCen, raising the total number of deputies to two-hundred and sixty-six, or by appointing these party leaders to the inner circle granting them sway over key government positions.

With it evident that Cardenal has continued his support and collaboration with the socialist government, our Cardinals have now approached Pope [ITA.Getleader] to hear their opinions on the matter and determine how best to proceed. While more conservative elements of the Church are demanding that the Pope proceed with laicization, removing the fallen priests' ties to the Church entirely removing his claims to Rome, and delegitimizing his sermons and appointment to government.

Relying on his charisma to compensate for his lack of negotiation experience and seemingly believing that the unions would recognize his recent labor reforms as evidence enough he is committed to ensuring a fair deal, the President underestimated the strikers’ demands and remained steadfast in his initial offer, refusing to hear any compromise. Faced with a seeming deadlock, negotiations have now broken down, with the streets of Managua once more empty and our workers unable to journey across the city or Republic. Refusing to acknowledge his failure, President Bukele has now requested that the Department of Transportation entice the unions back to the negotiation table with any offer similar to his own. However, given the missteps made by the President, the union leaders have stated they would not return to work unless their demands were met in full. Now, following delayed negotiations with the Department of Transportation, the strikes have officially ended, with the President claiming a victory for the workers, the public angered at the unions, and the workers decrying the President’s words and declaring he does not represent the best interests of the workers."

While planning to negotiate with the strikers himself, President Bukele was eventually turned off of the idea, having realized that despite his charming personality and warm relations with the unions, sometimes the easiest way to solve matters is to delegate responsibility to those qualified. With the unions now returning to work and the streets of Managua filling with buses, a decision has been made by the President to expand these agreements to all transportation unions across the country both to avoid similar strikes in the future and to send a message that the days of illegal strike action are over and that the workers are finally in control of their employers once more. However, while the workers and the President are satisfied, reports have still confirmed that the general populace has still refused to back the new labor reforms, arguing that the legitimization of strike action will be the eventual undoing of the Republic as now any industry can shut down for weeks on end if they believe that they can persuade the government to increase their wages. While unconvinced that in time the people will come around to support the reforms, and that strike action will always remain a contentious issue, the President has received word that many in the Republic have supported the government's quick action, with Managua overwhelmingly backing the swift resolution."

Highlighting the 1997 Constitutional Convention as proof of the necessity for the flag to remain as it was, these tired voices have gained little traction within ParlaCen, particularly now that their influence has begun to wane since the departure of President Ortega. Despite their respected status, Vice President Cerén has now suggested that Bukele deal with these accusations in some manner before they spiral and influence others into questioning the extent of the recent reforms. Proposing that the President utilize the Soviet Union as a way of demonstrating that while the flag may change, the commitment to the revolution remains.

Following on from the launch of Sandino 1 two months ago, in which an unmanned vessel successfully entered orbit and returned without issue, the AEC deemed it necessary to test the effects of launch and reentry on a living mammal. After careful deliberation, it was determined that a Mantled Howler would be the best fit for the operation, and having spent months searching for the calmest and focused primate Daniel the Mantled Howler, named so after former President Daniel Ortega, was selected to be the first of his species to orbit the Earth. While the mission began with a near-perfect launch, and the vessel reached orbit on schedule with Daniel alive and well throughout the process despite showing increased levels of stress following lift-off, the return journey has now revealed the flaws of our rocketry. After seventeen hours and thirty-three minutes, Sandino 2 began its reentry program where, to the devastation of our technicians and Daniel’s carers, the cooling system began to malfunction, leading to Daniel suffering intense heat stroke and passing away before splashdown.

Security Minister Monica Baltodano, speaking on behalf of the government, underscored the necessity of such measures in combating anti-Republican organizations deemed detrimental to the nation's stability and cohesion. Emphasizing the imperative of protecting national unity, Baltodano asserted that the crackdown on perceived threats is vital to ensuring the safety and security of all citizens and to advancing the process of Guatemala's integration into the wider Central American community. The raid and subsequent arrests signal a robust response by authorities to perceived challenges to governmental authority and regional cohesion. As the investigation unfolds and further details emerge, the government's actions are likely to elicit both support and scrutiny, underscoring the delicate balance between security imperatives and civil liberties in the pursuit of national unity and stability."

Fueled by deep-seated grievances and ideological divisions, the protests have now plunged the Republic into a precarious situation, with fears mounting that escalating violence could push the country to the brink of civil war. Bukele’s heavy-handed response to this dissent has only served to inflame passions further, as demonstrators now continue to voice their discontent with what they perceive as the further erosion of the limited democratic freedoms and political rights offered to the nation by the FLNC. While the Mayors of the Republic have unanimously denounced these protesters, demonstrating that the FLNC remains united against the nationalist threat, a large threat remains cast over the Republic’s now fragile stability which, unless handled carefully, will result in the unravelling of the hard-won gains of the revolution."

This comprehensive plan, consisting of multiple phases, is designed to dismantle anti-Republican groups while also addressing underlying socio-economic factors that contribute to their recruitment. At the core of the PCT is a two-pronged approach, which will first see security forces target the organizational structures of these groups, aimed at disrupting their activities and diminishing their influence before the next stage commences which involves direct government investment into community projects, including the construction of schools and sports centres to provide a healthy alternative to joining these movements. While a perfect solution to counteract the rise in nationalist gang violence, controversy has arisen over the PCT’s authorization of armed incursions into nationalist strongholds. These operations are intended to neutralize threats and regain control of areas where opposition forces have established a foothold. Additionally, President Bukele has announced plans for the construction of a high-security facility known as the Terrorism Confinement Center, designed to detain individuals deemed as threats to the Republic’s security. While the PCT represents a bold and decisive response to the growing threat of nationalism, the lack of clarity over what classifies as a nationalist stronghold has now seen mounting opposition to the plan from within the FLNC."

Refusing to allow his words to be misunderstood, Cerén described the PCT’s more extreme measures as draconian and argued that the allocation of resources towards the construction of a high-security facility would be a misstep in the progress towards ending the nationalist threat. Calling for a compromise on the bill, in which the funding into community projects is maintained, the suggestion has now placed the future of the project entirely in the hands of the members of ParlaCen. With a vote on tabling the compromise bill that has now passed through ParlaCen, it seems as though the President’s dream of an authoritative strike against the nationalist gangs will be swept aside and replaced by a watered-down bill he believes would not go far enough. As ParlaCen now convenes once more, this time to determine whether to pass the amended PCT bill, there may be enough time for the President to stop this assault on his legacy if he deems it necessary."

Refusing to allow any representative to leave the building until the vote had concluded, the President’s actions have now been broadcast across the Republic, sending shockwaves through local chapters of the FLNC, which have recognized this move as an attempt to consolidate power around the presidency once more.

Addressing ParlaCen in a speech following the passage of the act, Bukele acknowledged the necessity of compromise in the face of mounting nationalist tensions, while expressing his disappointment at the concessions made, believing that the CCT would have been a force for good if utilized as he had envisioned. Accepting the will of the party, Bukele has still managed to maintain a decisive victory over the forces of nationalism with the passage of this act, with the focus on targeting the organizational structures of the gangs and community outreach being regarded as effective tools for securing the integrity of the Republic.

Expressing his disgust at these injustices, particularly agreeing with Cáceras claim that the government had been abusing the land of the indigenous communities and turning a blind eye to the violent crimes committed against them, the President took an unprecedented step by issuing a formal apology to these communities on behalf of the government, and the FLNC. While the latter extension has been rejected by conservatives, with Acevedo and his allies claiming that there is no reason to apologize and that doing so only exacerbates these imagined issues created by these communities for sympathy, the President has already taken this a step further, acknowledging the systematic failures present in the Republic’s system and beginning to draft legislation to end decades of abuse and bring the FLNC into the modern era."

Declaring to the thousands before her that she stood before them with immense pride, Hándal began with a story from her youth and how her school had caught a caterpillar, believing that it would soon become a small butterfly. However, after a troublesome cocooning, in which the caterpillar was nearly believed to have died, it grew into a blue morpho, one of the largest and most beautiful butterflies she had ever seen. Ending her story, believing that those in the crowd were able to see the comparison she was making, Hándal commended the President, his cabinet, the local FLNC chapters, and the millions of members for their dedication to renewal, rebirth, and reform. Marking a symbolic moment for the FLNC, Hándal’s endorsement is a monumental moment for the President’s policies as it now sees the vindication of her husband's legacy, the triumph of the Renovator faction and the cementing of democratic socialism as the main ideology of the FLNC. Emphasizing Funes’ successes in moving away from the shameful legacy of Ortega, Hándal ended her time on stage saying her husband would be proud of the rapid reforms undertaken by the party, stating that she and no doubt the nation would continue to watch the transformation of the FLNC with great interest."

While a noble gesture, one that her mother has enthusiastically requested she accepts, various Reformists have demanded that this position be taken further and Erlinda be given a greater role in the President's cabinet, given her commendable scientific career and extensive knowledge of Soviet economic structures.

With security escorting Hándal from the stage, following her immediate call for the honest folk of the Republic to abandon the FLNC, the immediate reaction was nothing short of chaotic as event organizers hastily attempted to distract the audience with an impromptu music performance and a fireworks display. Despite these efforts, the sense of unease among party supporters remained palpable, with chants from the audience growing louder and louder for the return of Hándal to the stage. With the event being cut short, this incident has now caused significant distress within the halls of government as the Minister of Media and Data has ordered the immediate recall of all live versions of the event, demanding that Hándal’s speech be cut.

In a contentious and simultaneous vote, ParlaCen quickly secured the necessary two-thirds majority to remove Funes with the party membership stripping him of his role as party leader. In his place, former foreign minister Moises Omar Halleslevens was hurriedly and narrowly elected to the same roles as his predecessor. For weeks now, the FLNC’s hardliners have accused Funes of failing to distance the party from its reformist tendencies, seeing the recent event in Managua as the ultimate example of his failures to turn the nation back towards the righteous path laid out by Daniel Ortega. While ParlaCen has decried the move, calling it an insidious undermining of the democratically elected chamber, President Halleslevens has assured its members that nothing about his or his party’s actions was unconstitutional. With several representatives of the FLNC now abandoning the party in the wake of the vote, moving to join the People’s Alliance or stand as independent candidates, the mass exodus of the party’s moderates has thrown Halleslevens’s legislative agenda into turmoil with the Ortega-loyalist lacking a majority to pass any legislation."

Having cited several reasons for their immediate departure, most have cited Halleslevens himself as their primary reason for abandoning their party. Viewed as a continuation of Ortega, this sudden erosion of trust has presented a formidable challenge for the new President, who has already lost his majority in ParlaCen and has now lost much of his voter base to Civic Action and the Anti-Corruption Party. While securing re-election was already a difficult prospect for the President, this loss of confidence from the party base has ensured that re-election may be impossible, with only those left in the FLNC who would ever support a return to the policies of Ortega. However, with election season yet to officially begin, the President has maintained a level of optimism some have described as utopian, with Halleslevens promising a return to form and demanding the FLNC begin reconnecting with the grassroots of society, and ordering its remaining membership to become the party of the worker and peasant once again, demanding to achieve a second revolution at the ballot box."

Delegating the task to Luis Redondo, the parliamentary leader of the PAC, the President has put his support behind the motion but denied that he was the one who ordered its motion through ParlaCen. Hoping to pass the motion, the President has instructed Redondo to reach out to anyone he believes would be willing to listen to reason, with PAC representatives already requesting that their parliamentary leader take the obvious route forward and meet with members of the opposition, regardless of their ideology. However, with these figures more than likely willing to support the motion without any further negotiation, Redondo believes that the key forward is through the Constitutional Liberals, believing he would be able to untangle the web of deception and corruption created by Alemán over his allies.

Such an approach has been successful, with the Constitutional Liberals more than likely aware of the reason for Redondo’s visit. However, with time of the essence, Redondo has been taken aside once more by his parliamentary allies, calling for him to be more direct and cut to the chase, asking for their support against Alemán, suggesting that he must convince them that their leader is a nuclear bomb, whose radiation is in danger of destroying the Liberals entirely. Arguing that such an attack would be enough to convince the Liberals to side with the rest of ParlaCen in the upcoming vote, Redondo has now been sent back with explicit instructions to attack Alemán directly.

The leak, believed to have originated from the meeting itself, has now cast a dark shadow over the parliamentary leader and the PAC, who have now begun damage control in an attempt to maintain the favor of their coalition partners. However, regardless of whether this control would have been successful, Vice President Alemán has now predictably seized upon this opportunity to vehemently denounce Redondo in most public forums, labeling him with derogatory epithets and shifting the blame onto President Nasralla, whom he now accuses of betrayal and criminality in the unfolding controversy. Despite being investigated for corruption, this approach has somehow managed to regain the Vice President a degree of sympathy from the public and his party, who have challenged the notion that Alemán has failed in his duties as Vice President. With the no-confidence vote now imminent and Redondo having allegedly wasted his time attempting to untangle the web created by Alemán, it is now almost certain that the Vice President will survive, with Alemán already promising to make governance for the PAC a living hell for their betrayal."

The internal revolt of his party has left the Vice President politically vulnerable as public opinion continues to turn against him, with many seeing the decision taken by Rovira as confirmation that the allegations are entirely factual. Likewise, the loss of half of his party to President Nasralla has also ensured that any motion of no-confidence will automatically reach the fifty-four votes required so long as there are no defections from the PAC, Rovira’s LCs, or Civic Action who have already pledged to support the motion.

However, following the intense debate, the Vice President refused to budge, arguing that it was the actions of the Constitutional Liberals that had defaced democracy and that the Anti-Corruption Party should suffer the consequences for its failure to live up to its namesake. Yet, as hope seemed lost that the meeting would materialize any fruitful agreement, the Vice President, clearly recognizing the weakness of Redondo’s position, presented a way in which the two could agree- back Civic Action’s legislative agenda, establishing confidence and supply agreement. This prospective alliance, however, is likely to incite further friction within the Coalition of Freedom, as many representatives are ideologically opposed to Civic Action. Furthermore, while this agreement would ensure the continued stability of government once the Coalition of Freedom no doubt collapses, it would still fall short of the fifty-four votes required to pass the motion.

 centroamerica.363.d:0 "The most televised and discussed criminal trials in the history of the Republic has reached its dramatic conclusion today as former Vice President Arnoldo Alemán, facing charges of corruption, embezzlement, and abuse of power, has been found guilty on all counts. The courts, after a meticulous examination of the evidence against the Vice President, identified a clear pattern of Alemán allying himself with various figures within the United Fruit Company to use his high office for personal gain. With the courts finding no evidence that Alemán’s accomplices within the United Fruit Company were aware of his dealings in embezzlement or abuse of power, most of the companies charges have been dropped, however, the court has ordered the CFU to pay a total of 62 million Acres, as compensation for their involvement in buying Alemán’s favor. Allowed to walk as free men, the CFU have now seen a significant hit to their reputation as most across the Republic have continued to assert that its CEO and much of the company is as guilty as Alemán. Having presented a comprehensive case that detailed how the Vice President diverted funds for personal enrichment, the courts have now settled on a minimum ten-year sentence, with the chance of parole after five years, a ban on ever again pursuing political office, and a fine of one-hundred million acres. In a press conference following the verdict, President Nasralla commended the judiciary for their unwavering commitment to justice, praising the courts for their thorough investigation and thanking the initial La Prensa leak that began the nation’s road to recovery from the insidious grasp of corruption. With a precedent now set that no one is above the law, regardless of their status in society, the corrupt in society are now feeling the noose tighten around them."

While there had been calls for the former Vice President to serve his full sentence, his behavior in prison, combined with his eligibility, had all but ensured that his case manager would be able to secure parole for the most hated politician in the Republic. Confined to the Managua Department, forced to wear electronic monitoring, and working in his local library, the former Vice President reportedly had much time to think on his crimes, stating upon the start of his parole that if he had the chance he would go back and do things differently. With politics having rapidly changed since his imprisonment, the Vice President could not help but comment on how far the Republic had come since he had last walked the streets of Managua, reportedly reading the newspaper in the prison library every week to keep up on the new legislation being passed by President [CEA.GetLeader]. While barred from running for any political office, it seems as though the former Vice President cannot stay away from politics announcing his intention to write his memoirs and present a new light on his arrest."

To Alemán’s delight, the courts have only found him guilty of the embezzlement of party funds towards the purchase of his coastal villa but were unable to definitively prove any abuse of power during his time as Vice President, resulting in the Vice President being forced to pay back the sum of money he embezzled, a total of 62 million Acres. The verdict has sparked a significant outcry among critics who have perceived the punishment as a mere slap on the wrist for what they view as the actions of a serial fraudster. With evidence surrounding the involvement of the United Fruit Company dismissed from the trial owing to a lack of connections between the two parties, allegations have now been spread that the Vice President had utilized time in office to sway the courts through bribes and the selection of a jury favorable to him. However, with no evidence of this having taken place, the courts have maintained the sentence, with Alemán seemingly eager to begin repaying his debts to society. Perhaps expectedly, President Nasralla has remained conspicuously unreachable since the verdict was announced, recognizing the implications this has for the future of justice in the Republic, with the only official comment coming from the Presidential House being that it is not the President’s place to comment on judicial rulings."

With Deputy Daisy Torres having stood in for her predecessor following her arrest a few short weeks ago, the remnants of the left have done all they can to retain control over the department, increasing their spending and holding dozens of rallies across the region. However, while free of the crimes of her predecessor, Torres has failed to combat the reality of the situation with the charges of Montenegro being held over her throughout the campaign. Despite all their campaigning, Civic Action has now claimed a slight victory in the campaign, achieving fifty-five percent of the vote, leading to Pedro Joaquín Chamorro Barrios being declared the new Regional Administrator of Managua. Seemingly utilizing his time as the co-editor of the anti-FLNC newspaper La Prensa to his advantage and his recent return to the Republic following years in exile from Costa Rica to Panama, it seems as though the last beating heart of Ortega in the Republic has finally been pierced, as local governments across the nation have fiercely rejected the left, with over thirty Regional Administrators being affiliated with Civic Action, including Rodolfo Sunseri."

Arguing that while the current iteration of the constitution effectively addressed the political issues at the time of its inception, the President declared that it now imposes severe restrictions that hinder its ability to safeguard democracy, arguing that to truly eradicate the vestiges of Ortega’s grasp over the nation, much of the constitution needs a near-total rewrite. Opposition within ParlaCen has been quick to denounce the President’s ambitions, citing his desire to strengthen the presidency and the ruling party as a clear violation of what was agreed to after the fall of Ortega and a betrayal of the trust that the people have placed in Civic Action. Even with the President’s pledge to include all parties within ParlaCen to ensure that the voices of the nation are heard, most have rejected this as a clear power grab, stating that the supermajority held by Zelaya’s party means that no matter what discussion occurs, he can easily overwrite it. However, owing to the desires of the President to remove term limits for the presidency, the United Opposition has declared it would entertain the invitation, so long as more of its ideas were implemented into the new constitution. With precedent already in place for the calling of a Constitutional Convention without the presence of all of ParlaCen, most legal arguments against the move have failed to gain any traction. With political analysts arguing the move, while controversial, could fix the lingering remnants of Ortega’s rule over the Republic, the success of the convention ultimately rests with the public and their response to this alleged power grab."

Representing a diverse array of political organizations, the protesters have at least been united in their opposition to what they perceive as Zelaya’s authoritarian ambitions, chanting from the streets that they demand “Liberty over Zelaya”. The protest has seemingly captured the nation’s attention, with the media focusing on the chants comparing Zelaya to his predecessor, arguing it signals a clear widespread fear of a return to centralized power. Reportedly, advisors to the President have urged caution, suggesting that the protests will dissipate in time, and they represent nothing more than a sudden outburst of discontent rather than the beginnings of organized resistance. While plans for an immediate crackdown were allegedly in the works by Zelaya’s advisors, these have seemingly quickly been cast aside, with the President recognizing that a heavy-handed response would exacerbate tensions and lend credence to accusations of authoritarianism. Instead, the First Lady has suggested that a more proactive stance must be taken, either by allowing these protesters to run out of steam in the hopes of reconsolidating the narrative around the proposed constitutional amendments or rallying supporters of the President to oppose the rabble and demonstrate to the media that the nation supports the changes and Civic Action’s measures."

The spread of these protests has now brought forward worrying parallels for Civic Action, who can only recognize this same wave of anti-government sentiment was seen once before, during the wave of anti-Ortega protests shortly after the landfall of Hurricane Carlos. Eager to avoid a similar end as his predecessor, the President, who just days ago exuded confidence and determination in his actions, has now begun to contemplate his decisions to press on with the constitutional amendments without first gaining the support of ParlaCen. However, even if Zelaya gained the support of ParlaCen, without a significant crackdown against the protesters the integrity of the union would be at risk."

While the two groups first engaged in healthy debate, albeit nothing more than a shouting match, tensions began to escalate as accusations of fascism and Ortega loyalism were lambasted against the President. As a result, despite the attempts by Regional Administrator Barrios to ensure the police were well equipped to ensure violence could not occur, clashes began to break out at Luis Veláquez Park, near ParlaCen, following anti-Zelaya demonstrators hurling stones at their opponents. Now, in a surprising turn of events, media coverage of the clash has been increasingly critical of the anti-Zelaya protesters, characterizing their actions as inherently anti-democratic, childish, and outright violent, painting them as a group of radicals seeking to deny the rights of the nation to support the President’s reforms. While this has not cleared the President of wrongdoing, with the media still heavily against the calls for constitutional reform, the narrative shift brought about by the emergence of supporters of the reform has been instrumental in altering the public perception, who now see the pro-Zelaya demonstrators as defenders of free speech, and by extension the President the defender of democracy."

In a confidential meeting with his closest advisors, Vice President Martínez announced his opposition to the conventional arguing that amending the constitution without the agreement of all members of ParlaCen sets a dangerous precedent that the most fundamental laws of the Republic are at the mercy of the sitting President, going as far as to suggest that tomorrow the nation could wake up to see the President crown himself the Emperor of Centroamerica. Seemingly misunderstanding the intentions of the President and how the government functions, the Vice President’s advisors have attempted to calm this sudden opposition, claiming that the nature of a supermajority allows such radical change to occur, begging him to look at how constitutional amendments occurred in the United States. However, even this lesson in politics has failed to dissuade his opposition, with Martínez demanding his advisors stop belittling his understanding of politics and see the potential dangers of this change. With the Vice President, mere moments away from resignation should his warning not be heeded and plans for the convention shelved until the remainder of ParlaCen agrees to the reforms, Zelaya has now been informed of this ultimatum, recognizing that he needs to act immediately to prevent the party splitting."

Marking a significant u-turn by the government, protesters on the streets have celebrated the announcement relieved that their combined efforts, along with internal disagreements within government, has been able to successfully showcase the limits of Zelaya’s influence, and demonstrated that even when faced with a supermajority in government, the voices of the minority can still break through and halt the advancement of authoritarianism. Seizing the opportunity presented by Zelaya’s concession, the leader of the opposition, Salvador Nasralla, has now tabled legislation that would require all future calls for Constitutional Conventions to achieve a three-quarters majority from ParlaCen. While many had expected such a bill to fail, owing to the fact that the opposition holds only twenty seats combined, a sudden defection of twenty-six representatives from Civic Action, has ensured the motion will now become law. While many had expected the President to suspend those who supported the amendment, it seems as though Zelaya, humbled by recent events, has instead begun a period of reconciliation with his party attempting to regain their favor and demonstrate to them, and the nation, why he is the Father of Central American democracy."

In a press conference outside of the Jiloa Military Training Facility, General René Osorio, who has emerged as a leading figure among anti-Zelaya officers, voiced his concerns about the potential erosion of democracy, articulating his apprehensions regarding the Second Constitutional Convention, suggesting it could be a stepping stone for Zelaya to consolidate further power and send the Republic back to the days of Ortega. Finishing his speech, Osorio has now sent a clear message to the President, reminding him and the nation, of the crucial role the armed forces played in ousting President Ortega, stating that any attempt to replicate the authoritarian path walked by the tyrant would be met with the same resolute opposition. Despite such fierce denunciation, the reaction from the government has been cautious, with the President’s spokesperson only reiterating the administration’s commitment to democratic principles and stressing that the proposed reforms aim to enhance, not undermine the nation’s democratic framework.

Detailing how he would be able to coerce officials close to the General to turn their backs on their esteemed leader through careful pruning and enticement, all the while ensuring that Zelaya could maintain plausible deniability of his involvement as the sudden change of heart by officials could easily be perceived as the military independently reaffirming their loyalty to the President and wishing to avoid confrontation. However, such a strategy is not without significant risks. Most notably, while Robelo’s proposals are an enticing solution to the divide brewing, it is obvious that the CEO’s solution is nothing short of bribery and blackmail. Such an ethically questionable resolution, if discovered, would only further legitimize Osorio’s statements and renew the anti-Zelaya protests on the street. Furthermore, agreeing to this plan would also more than likely place the President in the pocket of Grupo Centroamericano, who would no doubt use their influence to entangle the President in future obligations to their business.

Zelaya has now called upon the military high command to take immediate action to purge any disloyal elements from their ranks, warning that if they fail to act, he will take matters into his own hands- a likely reference to the authorization of another executive order, similar to 0754. Such forceful rhetoric has, however, not been well-received by the opposition, who have criticized these statements as reckless and inflammatory, arguing that they only serve to deepen the ongoing political crisis. However, the irony of these comments is not lost on the military, who has noted that it was Executive Order 0754 that had originally promoted Osorio and other anti-Ortega figures. As the situation stands, the military high command has remained silent on the matter, unsure of whether to heed the demands of the President or side with Osorio. With neither willing to back down, the end to this conflict seems to be imminent, as all contact between the government and the military has now ended."

Sandino International Airport. In a bold address to ParlaCen following its swift occupation by Osorio’s forces, the General himself spoke to the nation, asserting that the military’s action was not a means to overturn democracy but to shield the nation from what he characterized as President Zelaya’s authoritarian ambitions. Revealing the President’s plans for the Second Constitutional Convention, Osorio declared that Zelaya had plans to revoke term limits for the presidency, establish the majority party in ParlaCen as the effective vanguard of the country, effectively outlawing the opposition, and reestablish Ortega-style elections to ensure a majority for Civic Action would be assured regardless of the official result. Arguing that the President had become corrupted by his ego, Osorio requested that all citizens remain in their homes and allow the military free rein to do its job and ensure democracy can survive. While their presence has been challenged by some members of the public, this has quickly been put down with Zelaya loyalists arrested for the assault of officers.

In the wake of these dramatic events, former Vice President Maximino Rodriguez Martinez has been elevated to the position of President by General Osorio, who has now put forward a motion to ParlaCen requiring a two-thirds majority for all future attempted amendments to the constitution. With Zelaya no longer in control of Civic Action, the passage of this act was expected to be a simple affair with many anticipating an overwhelming rebellion to occur within the party.

However, the outcome proved to be much different than the disgraced President had hoped. Despite the evidence provided by General Osorio during his march on the ParlaCen, in which a memo was discovered detailing the upcoming changes to the constitution, the lack of an official document signed by the President has brought forward questions as to whether these were the President’s plans or if it was a draft made by an overzealous representative of ParlaCen. Testifying he had never seen the document before, the courts have only been able to find the President guilty of acting unconstitutionally following his decision to organize the Second Constitutional Convention, sentencing the President and his Vice President to twenty years of house arrest. Able to avoid a similar fate to the President, likely due to their testimony against him, the former Zelaya cabinet has been let free into society, albeit a society that will now shame them to their deaths, after paying a combined three-hundred and fifty million Acres.

Taking their words further, the high command has issued a clear statement promising disciplinary actions against Osorio, and any who support his conspiracy theory regarding the President as well as Osorio’s desire to create doubt regarding the fragility of the democratic institutions of the Republic. With the public reassured that the military will not be marching on the capital to depose the President any time soon, Osorio now finds himself isolated, with no support from his fellow officers. As a result, the fate of this once esteemed general now lies in the hands of the President, who is more than eager to have him stripped of his military ranks and forced to live an isolated life away from all the glory he once held. However, despite this desire being shared among the cabinet, the President is more than aware of the dangers of such a move, both politically and militarily.

In response to the conclusion of the investigation, President Hernández has taken the opportunity to reiterate his beliefs that the entire affair was nothing more than a baseless fabrication aimed at undermining his administration, an administration that had since then been rumored to be on a knife's edge as the opposition in ParlaCen continued to try draft articles of impeachment against him for his unsubstantiated involvement in such horrific crimes. However, regardless of the witch hunt, the President has come out and expressed his relief that his Mexican counterparts came to their senses and recognized the lack of merit in the allegations, now promising to visit [MEX.GetLeader] shortly and undo the temporary pause in trade relations. With this scandal seemingly behind the President, efforts have now been made to begin the careful restructuring of the OAI to ensure that a paper trail can never again be made between it and its legitimate business associates."

 centroamerica.387.d:0 "In a stunning turn of events, CISEN have publicly accused Tony Hernández, the Minister of Justice and brother of the President, of orchestrating a scheme to channel funds from the Bureau of Alternative Investments to the Mérida gangs and other criminal organizations. According to the prosecutors, Hernández directed the OAI office in Mexico City to funnel money to the gangs, with the ultimate goal of establishing a vast underground network of illegal drug trafficking across Mexico, designed with the intent of making  Hernández a player equal in strength to the cartels of old. With the news now rapidly spreading across international media, President Hernández has been quick to distance himself from his brother’s actions. In a forceful statement, he condemned both Tony and the OAI, asserting that they had operated behind his back and betrayed the trust and resources granted to them by the government, going further to express his deep disappointment and vowing to take swift action to address the scandal. With the Mexican investigation ongoing, the President has pledged full cooperation with their authorities, removing his brother from his position in government and authorizing his extradition to Mexico. While Tony no doubt expected his brother to be his savior, it is evident that no help shall arrive, as the President has already appointed Hilda Hernández, his sister, to replace him."

According to the allegations, President Hernández directed the OAI office in Mexico City to fund resources to local gangs, solidifying his connections with criminal elements across the region. As mountains of evidence against the President emerged, with paper trails running a mile long, the case against the President only worsened following the revelation of communication between the OAI and the cartels of Montana, with the Justice Department of Mexico now reaching out to several American states to inform them of their findings. In response to these damning revelations, the Mexican government has now issued a direct and urgent demand to the Republic, insisting on the extradition of President Hernández and his brother Tony, pushing relations between Managua and Mexico City to the edge. Despite all this evidence, the President has one ace up his sleeve, the fact he maintains control over the legislature, and while a no-confidence vote has been proposed by the opposition it would still fall short by thirteen votes given the current make-up of ParlaCen. Declaring his innocence and darring the opposition to try to remove him, the President has now refused to cooperate with what he calls the corrupt Mexican authorities, expelling their diplomats and sitting solemnly within the Presidential House, hoping that an answer will soon appear."

With ParlaCen seemingly worried about the potential for the arrival of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime at our shores, the motion of no-confidence against the President has now been accelerated. Citing the President’s criminal behavior and the grave threat his tenure now poses to the nation’s stability and international standing, the motion has now reached the floor, and despite the President’s insistence that it would fail due to the composition of the legislature, over sixty representatives have now backed the motion, with thirty-three United Opposition delegates defecting. Having been stripped of all his power, all his strength, Juan Orlando Hernández could only watch as ParlaCen voted in his successor, his sister, Hilda, who has pledged not to pardon her brother and has moved to strip Tony Hernández of all his responsibilities of office to ensure that he too may be extradited to Mexico. However, the transition of power was not without issue- as the now-former President was reportedly heard denouncing his party as communist devils, before being removed from ParlaCen’s chambers and taken to Sistema Penitenciario La Modelo, where he now awaits the next steps of the new administration."

There, they are set to face trial for their alleged involvement in orchestrating and funding extensive narcotics smuggling operations throughout the country. Having been taken from Sistema Penitenciario La Modelo to Augusto C. Sandino International Airport, the former President’s would-be empire has now been dismantled following President Hernández’s declaration that the OAI would be shut down, its employees investigated, and all profit either returned or distributed to charities in the Republic and Mexico aimed at tackling addiction, and helping those recover from the scourge of drug abuse. With Hilda now thrust into the national spotlight, the President now faces the daunting task of navigating her country through a crisis that threatens to undermine the very foundations of her party, which has already split following the defection of the eight members who voted against the removal of her brother. Already demoralized by the scandal, the United Opposition now sits as a minority government, ashamed of its leadership and unable to mount a meaningful comeback despite its overwhelming rejection of Juan Orlando. There is, however, a bitter irony in the downfall of Juan Orlando, a man who rose to power as a political martyr only to end his career in disgrace under similar circumstances. A man once hailed as a hero who had been unjustly imprisoned by the Ortega regime, Hernández now finds himself imprisoned again - this time with few defenders and even fewer who believe he is undeserving of his fate."

While this connection may appear self-evident, the declaration has marked a notable shift in the Republic’s historical narrative as, since its founding, the Republic has largely avoided drawing parallels to its 19th-century predecessor, with the FLNC focusing on a shared history in anti-imperialism and revolutionary struggle. This symbolic declaration indicates a deliberate effort to reconnect the nation with its broader historical legacy. By anchoring the modern Republic in a historical narrative that predates the socialist revolution, the administration has signaled a more inclusive vision of the country’s past, hoping to build a state where both landowner and peasant can be proud of their nation’s history."

Formed as a coalition of dissidents, rebels, and Christian democrats opposed to the dictatorship of Daniel Ortega, the United Opposition’s conference has decreed that with the end of the FLNC dictatorship, their namesake no longer holds any relevance to the democratic society the nation finds itself in. Likewise, it appears as though the now National Alliance has sought to expand its base, seeing itself no longer as the opponent to dictatorship but as an alliance of nationalists dedicated to building a stronger and more unified Republic. While the party conference was largely in agreement, some elements of the new National Alliance have offered a brief pause to the gun-ho nature of its President, arguing that the party must ensure its name is recognized by both its core base and beyond if it is ever to separate itself from its past while maintaining its supporters and offering a future for new voters."

Calleja, who has long been respected for his technocratic approach and economic expertise, has vowed to lead the party in a new direction, promising a revamped political agenda focused solely on economic growth and transparency. A significant part of this strategy has been his immediate reform of the United Opposition into the National Alliance, having secured the backing of the party membership to do so. According to party insiders and comments made by Calleja, the rebranding has been done to project a fresh and modern image onto the party- one focused on national unity and development rather than its historic legacy of opposition to the former FLNC dictatorship. While Callega’s leadership is seen by many as a potential turning point, many political observers remain skeptical, recognizing that public support for the National Alliance is at an all-time low. With the shadow of Hernández still hovering above the party and Calleja’s efforts to distance himself from his party’s past seemingly failing, only time will tell if the last-minute change will be enough to salvage the party from irrelevancy."

As the son of Deputy Command Borge, who served under Augusto César Sandino himself, Tomás’ life was steeped in revolutionary ideology, with his lifelong commitment to these ideals solidified through his close friendship with Carlos Fonseca, with whom he co-founded the predecessor of the FLNC. Heading the Prolong Popular War Faction, known for its strategy of building support among the rural and peasant populations, Tomás’ influence extended across the political realm, where he served as Interior Minister during the final stages of the Nicaraguan revolution and subsequent unification of Central America, and by the turn of the century, Tomás continued to serve his country by acting as the ambassador to the Union of American People’s Republics. Given his widespread support among the rural communities, the turnout for his funeral has been an unprecedented figure, with a day of mourning granted by President [CEA.GetLeader].

Following years of preparation to avoid similar damage as Carlos, early reports have suggested that our preparations have paid off. While Honduras experienced heavy rains leading to landslides and road blockages, no casualties have been reported from the immediate landfall. However, as the storm continued in land reaching as far as El Salvador, reports have now confirmed the death of five children, who perished after being caught in a flooded creek. Though the overall damage has been less severe than expected, the OEM has been quick to caution the immediate celebrations by President [CEA.GetLeader] arguing that Barry was not even classified as a category one hurricane, warning that a storm with the forces of Carlos is inevitable, and that preparations must be made to strengthen defenses for future hurricanes. Agreeing to increase the OEM’s funding, and now making preparations for the funerals of the five children, the President is hopeful that once reconstruction has been completed the Republic will emerge from this disaster united and ready to face the future."

In response, the government has now issued a red warning across Miskito, Alajuela, Heredia, and Guanacaste provinces, ordering the immediate evacuation of over sixteen thousand citizens. While most complied with the demands, resistance has emerged among local farmers who are hesitant to abandon their nearly ripe coffee crops, essential to their livelihoods. Despite promises of compensation, police were forced to intervene, ensuring that anyone refusing to evacuate was at least escorted to a designated safety shelter. Acknowledging that damage to critical infrastructure is inevitable, the government’s primary focus has now shifted towards both minimizing the death toll and maintaining civil stability in the hurricane’s aftermath, with twelve-thousands officers on standby to begin handing out aid packages containing fresh water, food, and sleeping bags. Despite our extensive efforts, Otto has left behind a tragic toll of twenty-three dead, dealing an estimated one-hundred and ninety-two million Acres worth of damages.

In a show of unprecedented cooperation, Nicaragua has prepared twenty-four thousand pounds of food for distribution, El Salvador has opened one-thousand two-hundred shelters, and provided over three hundred buses to begin evacuations, and Costa Rica has begun preparations for emergency medical relief to combat potential outbreaks of disease in the hurricane’s wake. For the first time in our recent history, the Republic has united in a concerted effort to face the wrath of Mother Nature. However, despite every precaution made, the human toll has been devastating, with seventy-six confirmed deaths.

Although President Daniel Ortega has spent the past few weeks dealing with the looming crisis and formulating a nationwide plan to deal with the fallout of Hurricane Carlos, it has become evident that these plans have been less than perfect as the death toll now exceeds seven thousand, with many more displaced. With an estimated 3.4 billion rubles of damage, the Central American economy is expected to emerge from the catastrophe in ruins with reports that Cuba has extended offers of aid to the crippled state. With the trajectory of the hurricane expected to travel north towards Guatemala and Belize, the two states are already on standby for the arrival of the inevitable having held similar meetings over the past few weeks to address their nation's response to the hurricane. Though the strength of Hurricane Carlos is expected to weaken as it approaches the north of Central America, dissipating over Yucatan, the world can only watch on in horror as the livelihoods of millions are destroyed and thousands suffer at this dreadful event caused by Mother Nature."

Although scorned by members of the National Front for the Liberation of Central America for his counterrevolutionary behavior, with the President now defecting to the Liberal opposition, the announcement has ushered in a wave of support for the President, who had recently suffered a significant drop in approval ratings over his decision to have former President Daniel Ortega arrested.

With the future of the Republic of Costa Rica uncertain as the Alliance of Costa Rican Resistance now seems poised to collapse over political differences, President Walter Muñoz Céspedes has remained hopeful for the survival of his presidency, choosing to focus his attention on the immediate reconstruction of his beloved nation."

While dealing with the effects of the revelations of their election interference, President [CEA.Getleader] has now begun to retake control of the narrative over the recent uprising, proclaiming that for the second time in under a decade, the unification of Central America has taken a step towards its completion through the defeat of the fascist menace to the south. With protests still ongoing and the leadership of the Alliance of Costa Rican Resistance having evaded capture and retreating into the vast forests of Costa Rica, martial law has been imposed across the region with [CEA.Getleader] eager to finally find and eradicate the last vestiges of resistance to unity. Despite condemnation for the continued occupation of Costa Rica reaching Managua from the United Nations, it appears unlikely that these condemnations will have any effect as the flames and hopes of an independent Costa Rican state seems to have been extinguished forever."

centroamericanews.15.d:0 "Devastating news is now leaving the Central American Republic as it appears as though renewed efforts by Managua to revive the Nicaragua Canal Project have ended in ecological disaster, first spotted by local fishermen and later confirmed by the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources. Having signed off on the monumental task of constructing the canal himself, President Nayib Bukele has now found himself in an awkward position and has already begun attempting to shift the blame onto his scientific advisors, who have reportedly been feeding the President misinformation about the extent of the damage to the environment. With public backlash immense and environmental activists taking to the streets of Managua and other regional capitals, Bukele has now announced a reversal of the planned completion of the canal, which was allegedly weeks from completion, to mitigate the damage and prevent the further deterioration of Lake Nicaragua’s delicate ecosystem. With Central America’s neighbors already offering support to the struggling state, support that has reportedly been declined, the environmental collapse has revealed the failures of President Bukele’s efforts to revitalize the industrial capabilities of the Republic and put a temporary halt to any future projects."

While attempts had been made to redirect the trajectory of the rocket, with the Eternauta on board attempting to use the lunar module as a means to push themselves back into the Moon’s orbit, all attempts were unsuccessful, and Managua has now reported that contact with Sandino 5 has been lost. With the Sandino Program having marked a renewed interest in space travel across the globe, with many nations seeing the recent successes of the Central America satellite programs as justification to begin their return to the stars, this tragedy has now quickly undone this hope with many states not wishing to follow in America’s footsteps- spending billions of dollars for a short-term propaganda victory. As the world watches out into the stars, the four Eternauta aboard Sandino 5 can only look back at their home, seeing it grow distant, awaiting a rescue that will never come."

Despite meticulous planning and preparation by the Cosmos Exploration Agency, reports have now confirmed that Sandino 5’s explosion came as a result of catastrophic engine failure, which resulted in rapid overheating and subsequent explosion. While this is a tragedy alone, reports from Managua have now also confirmed that the situation has been further exacerbated by the debris from the rocket falling into the nature reserve below, resulting in a mass forest fire. Home to dozens of species of animals and encompassing over two thousand acres of land, the reserve has now been caught in a blaze, with Central America’s emergency services scrambling to extinguish the fire before it can become another Hurricane Carlos. With residents being evacuated, there has been little word from President Bukele, who will now more than likely be forced to cancel his project to reach the Moon as public opinion once more turns against the idea of manned space travel."

Following three and a half days of travel to enter lunar orbit, Captain Francisco Rubio has now descended onto the surface of the Moon where he planted the flag of Central America. Planting mankind's returning footsteps only a few hundred metres away from where Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed in 1971, the continuity of the event has rung true with Captain Rubio’s words, who promised to visit the flag planted by his predecessors decades ago. With the descent and unfurling of the Republic’s flag relayed across international television, the significance of this event has not gone unnoticed by world leaders, who have now considered renewing efforts to reach the Moon, seeing that the event has been closely watched by billions across the world. However, while this renewed support has begun conversations from Europe to America to Asia, it is unlikely that any state will follow in Bukele’s footsteps within the coming years, given the expense of such a program. Until such a day comes, the world can be relieved that mankind's expeditions to the stars did not die alongside the United States and that the torch of the exploratory spirit continues to be."

Alleged to be involved in bribery and abuse of power, an official investigation into the Vice President’s actions was launched shortly after the publication of an investigatory article in La Prensa, which provided detailed evidence that Alemán had recently purchased a luxury villa near Chepes Beach on the Bay Islands, using funds taken from the Anti-Corruption Party’s coffers and donations made by the United Fruit Company. Refusing to wait for a verdict by the courts, ParlaCen has today confirmed the impeachment of Alemán, securing the needed fifty-four votes and a two-thirds majority. Having to be forcefully removed from ParlaCen’s chambers following the announcement, the disgraced Vice President has now been placed on house arrest until the conclusion of his trial, which is expected to reach a verdict in the coming months. With his replacement, Marlene Alvarenga, being sworn in shortly after his removal, the new Vice President has promised to uphold the office as faithfully as she can, pledging to ensure that the integrity of the office is restored and that never again shall corruption be allowed to fester within the halls of government."

However, despite having survived his impeachment, Alemán is still awaiting his trial, where it is expected the courts will find him guilty on all charges. In response to this betrayal by his once closest allies, Alemán has now declared that he and his Constitutional Liberal Party will be leaving the Coalition of Freedom, effectively deadlocking the Central American government and leaving President Nasralla unable to pass meaningful legislation to combat the now evident corruption that is still plaguing the country."

With tensions beginning months prior, following the announcement by Zelaya that he would move ahead with attempts to amend the Central American constitution without the presence of all parties in ParlaCen. The military's march on the capital only began following warnings by General Osorio about the creeping level of authoritarianism within the President's administration, prompting Zelaya to claim that the military was under the influence of Daniel Ortega and were plotting to overthrow him. Having confirmed Zelaya’s suspicions, the Central American armed forces have now completed their objectives and replaced the attempted despot with former Vice President Maximino Rodriguez Martinez, who resigned earlier in the year following disagreements with Zelaya over the pursuit of constitutional reform. With chaos still plaguing the Central American government and former President Zelaya now being temporarily detained in prison for his attempted auto-coup, only time will tell whether the Republic can survive this odd coup and if its democratic institutions can be maintained."

However, despite these promises by President Zelaya, the Second Constitutional Convention has been marked by anything but stability as all opposition parties in ParlaCen chose to boycott the convention, claiming to international observer that the amendments were approved without the unanimous consent of those in government and that Zelaya had been utilizing his super-majority to ensure he would become the most powerful man in the Republic. With the opposition's boycott of the Convention, the new constitution of Central America was quickly agreed to and, as warned, granted Zelaya and Civic Action sweeping controls over government and all future elections. Having granted himself the power to veto any piece of legislation he desires and eradicating term limits for the presidency and Regional Administrators, it is evident that the once-thought Father of Central American democracy has fallen from grace, with even the courts now unable to stop his rise to dictatorship."

According to CISEN, Hernández has been directing the recently established Bureau of Alternative Investment to funnel money to local gangs, with the ultimate goal of establishing a vast underground network of illegal drug trafficking across much of North America. Despite their familial ties, the President has been quick to denounce his brother’s criminality, firing him from the position of Minister of Justice, and asserting he did not know of the criminal conspiracy. While CISEN has cleared President Hernández of any wrongdoing, questions have been raised as to how such a widespread case of corruption could occur under a government agency. Complying with Mexican demands, President Hernandez has already prepared for Juan Antonio’s extradition, beginning a lengthy court trial that will ultimately result in his imprisonment."

However, while the FLNC has unanimously elected Cruz to his position, elements of the opposition have made themselves known to their new President’s reformist attitudes. With a lack of a codified line of succession within the FLNC’s constitution, should Cruz fail to unify the party around him, he and Second Secretary Funes may soon go the same way as Daniel Ortega."

As international trade now undergoes rapid and drastic change seemingly overnight, the only respite for the Democratic League and the rest of the capitalist world has been that the unification of Central America has placed an irreparable strain on the FLNC’s administration and economy, with mass reforms now needed if [CEA.GetLeader] is to ensure the survival of their revolution and socialism in Central America."
