rebel.1.t:0 "Broker Peace With Philadelphia?"
 rebel.1.d:0 "A small clique of military officials within the current rebel administration have proposed brokering peace with Central Committee loyalists. Their plan details the establishment of a Provisional New England government, immediate transfer of New York and our base territories in Michigan to Philadelphia, as well as a formal treaty in order to reconcile the two nations. President [Root.GetLeader] is concerned about the unique plan, as it would essentially mean the end of our vision for a democratic America spanning from the East coast to West coast. On the other hand, if loyalists in the People's Commonwealth accepted our proposal it would bring an end to this terrible civil war and allow the American people to reconcile into a more prosperous future. In the end this small clique has no power within the government, so any final decisions regarding the matter are up to the commander in chief of our rebel forces. Will it be peace, or war?"
 rebel.1.o1:0 "Call for peace"
 rebel.1.o2:0 "Keep fighting"
 rebel.2.t:0 "Rebels Want Peace"
 rebel.2.d:0 "President [AMC.GetLeader] and commander of the rebel forces has proposed an unprecedented peace deal to us. Delivered via an anonymous neutral connection between the two sides in this devastating civil war, the plan is extensive but only a few points truly caught the eyes of our entire Central Committee. Upon our acceptance of the peace deal the American Commonwealth will cease to exist, replaced by a 'New England Provisional Government'. New England's administration will subsequently renounce all claims to territories outside the region and transfer direct control of loyal states like New York and Michigan over to Philadelphia. The capital's halls of power are increasingly divided on the issue, with half calling for immediate acceptance and an end to the civil war... while the other half demand our leadership tear up the proposal and continue to crush whatever is left of Sanders' loyalists."
 rebel.2.o1:0 "Accept"
 rebel.2.o2:0 "Refuse"
 rebel.3.t:0 "Philadelphia Rejects Peace"
 rebel.3.d:0 "Central Committee loyalists have rejected our proposal for a peace treaty, even after explaining extensive benefits for their side in the civil war. It seems those tyrants wish to continue the war and murder millions in the name of their demented ideology. Admittedly however, it wasn't President [Root.GetLeader]'s initial belief that Philadelphia would accept the treaty proposal in any form, but hoped that peace could be attained for the sake of America's innocent populace. Now we have to fight on and continue the struggle for democracy..."
 rebel.3.o1:0 "Ok"
 rebel.4.t:0 "Philadelphia Agrees to Peace"
 rebel.4.d:0 "Central Committee loyalists have accepted our proposal for a peace treaty, after we explained extensive benefits for their side in the civil war. It seems both factions don't wish to continue the war and murder millions in the name of each respective ideology. Admittedly however, it wasn't President [Root.GetLeader]'s initial belief that Philadelphia would accept the treaty proposal in any form, but is clearly ecstatic upon hearing the news that America's innocent populace can finally have peace. Now preparations must be made for a formal treaty after this temporary armistice."
 rebel.4.o1:0 "Ok"
 rebel.5.t:0 "Treaty of Columbus"
 rebel.5.d:0 "As both executive branches of the rival Philadelpha and Montpelier governments refused to attend the Treaty of Columbus for security reasons, delegations from each faction in the civil war arrived this morning in the Ohio capital to sign a historic deal. Hours of final negotiations dominated the meeting, but in the end representatives managed to agree on the specifics of the treaty's final form. At exactly 6:00 PM, John Kasich stepped forward to sign the Treaty of Columbus on behalf of those he had sworn allegiance to in the American Commonwealth, and his counterpart representing Philadelphia followed. The latter is relatively unknown in national politics, but managed to be given a standing ovation from the observing crowd after he lifted his pen from the document. Finally the Second American Civil War has been resolved, and our two nations can get back to reconciliation and reconstruction."
 rebel.5.o1:0 "Ok"
 rebel.6.t:0 "Constitutional Convention"
 rebel.6.d:0 "The Treaty of Columbus has determined the international appearance and identity of our country as New England, but there is still significant work to be done until the people have a functioning government. The first step in this process is a much-anticipated constitutional convention, calling delegates from all around New England to debate about what form of government we will stick to for years from now. Some radical proposals have already been shot down, and now only two stand as solid possibilities for New England's future... republicanism and monarchism. Supporters of a royal government believe this will ensure stability, security and the defence of our nation against foreign threats. Republicans have called a royal New England 'the epitome of throwing away an outstanding opportunity to strengthen democracy'. With the constitutional convention nearing its end, the time has come for delegates to finally make a decision on this issue and close the political vacuum."
 rebel.6.o1:0 "A monarch for New England!"
 rebel.6.o2:0 "A President for New England!"
 rebel.7.t:0 "The Three Dynasties"
 rebel.7.d:0 "The New England Royal Council concluded not long ago that a French royal should be invited to take the position of New England's head of state. However, the troubling situation engulfing French monarchism for hundreds of years brings forth another decision for the Council. Should a Legitimist, Orleanist or Bonaparte royal lead our people?"
 rebel.7.o1:0 "Legitimist"
 rebel.7.o2:0 "Orleanist"
 rebel.7.o3:0 "Bonaparte"
 rebel.8.t:0 "General Election"
 rebel.8.d:0 "The first general election under Queen Zara is being held today, being the first entirely free and fair vote for our populace since the very beginning of the 1988 revolution. The Windsor monarch has followed constitutional monarchist tradition in refusing to endorse a candidate or any political position, only addressing the people in a television speech. She declared that this was the beginning of a new era for New England, and that whoever became Prime Minister in this election would have her full support in the coming years... as long as they worked for the people and not other interests. Currently opinion polls have two parties way ahead of the social democratic, centrist and progressive movements, which have failed in recent weeks to make any major gains. Conservative members of the American Whigs are sitting at the top, with the Democratic Alliance following not too far behind."
 rebel.8.o1:0 "American Whigs"
 rebel.8.o2:0 "Democratic Alliance"
 rebel.9.t:0 "New England Wants Bermuda"
 rebel.9.d:0 "The Kingdom of New England has demanded we hand over the British posession of Bermuda, suggesting that Queen Zara's position as a Windosr is grounds for greater cooperation between our two nations. Why they think that fact has any impact on the sovereignty of Bermuda's citizens is concerning, but nevertheless it is still up to [Root.GetLeader] as to whether their proposal will be accepted or rejected."
 rebel.9.o1:0 "Accept"
 rebel.9.o2:0 "Refuse"
 rebel.10.t:0 "British Accept"
 rebel.10.d:0 "The British government has accepted our demand of immediate transfer of the Bermuda island. Many had come to believe that London would vehemently oppose any deal for their possession, but these speculators were shocked after [ENG.GetLeader] announced this morning that the treaty would in fact go through without any opposition from the British government. Hopefully New England can quickly settle into the island as new administrators with full cooperation from local citizens. If they don't however, it will be easy to replace them with more adventurous New Englanders."
 rebel.10.o1:0 "Great"
 rebel.11.t:0 "British Refuse"
 rebel.11.d:0 "The British government has rejected our demand of immediate transfer of the Bermuda island. Many had come to believe that London would vehemently oppose any deal for their possession, and it seems they were unfortunately right. Hardly anyone was shocked after [ENG.GetLeader] announced this morning that the treaty would not go through, as strong opposition from the British government as a whole prevented it. This is a significant blow to [AMC.GetLeader]'s leadership, seen as a failed Prime Minister in recent weeks for foreign policy blunders such as these. Nevertheless, he will more than likely maintain his position as head of government due to support from a party majority."
 rebel.11.o1:0 "Damn"
 rebel.12.t:0 "New England Invades Bermuda"
 rebel.12.d:0 "Those bastards in the Kingdom of New England have just invaded Bermuda without warning. Just a few hours ago communications with the small island possession were cut off and we lost contact with fleets surrounding it. Cabinet now comes to the momentous decision of whether to retaliate and take back Bermuda, or let it slide in order to hopefully avoid a terrible pan-Atlantic war. The latter is not a popular opinion within [ENG.GetLeader]'s cabinet, and such an explicit neglect of Bermuda's populace will certainly be frowned upon by the international community. Could this be [ENG.GetLeader]'s Falklands?"
 rebel.12.o1:0 "Do nothing"
 rebel.12.o2:0 "Declare war"
 rebel.13.t:0 "Britain Backs Down"
 rebel.13.d:0 "Those idiots in London have just announced that they will not be retaliating against New England in response to our rightful occupation of Bermuda. Just a few hours ago communications with the small island possession were cut off and [ENG.GetLeader]'s navy lost contact with fleets surrounding it. When cabinet came to the momentous decision of whether to take back Bermuda, or let it slide in order to avoid a pan-Atlantic war, the Prime Minister chose the latter option. Now the Kingdom of New England is seen as a powerful force on the world stage, while Britain failed to take this opportunity to restore pride."
 rebel.13.o1:0 "Ok"
 rebel.14.t:0 "Britain Declares War"
 rebel.14.d:0 "Those bastards in London have just announced that they will be retaliating against New England in response to our rightful occupation of Bermuda. Just a few hours ago communications with the small island possession were cut off and [ENG.GetLeader]'s navy lost contact with fleets surrounding it. When cabinet came to the monumentous decision of whether to take back Bermuda, or let it slide in order to avoid a pan-Atlantic war, the Prime Minister chose the former option. Now the Kingdom of New England is seen as a violent aggressor, and we could very well be destroyed by British forces in the coming weeks or months. Perhaps we poked the lion too soon."
 rebel.14.o1:0 "Ok"
 rebel.15.t:0 "The Family Tree"
 rebel.15.d:0 "The New England Royal Council concluded not long ago that a Roosevelt family member should be invited to take the position of New England's head of state. However, there are two major lines within the family tree of the Roosevelts, bringing forth another major decision for the Council. Should a descendant of President Theodore Roosevelt or Franklin Roosevelt become the first monarch of our beautiful New England Kingdom?"
 rebel.15.o1:0 "Descendants of Teddy"
 rebel.15.o2:0 "Descendants of Franklin"
 rebel.16.t:0 "New York Ultimatum"
 rebel.16.d:0 "Before we send an unconditional ultimatum to the government across New York's border, several senior advisors to the King have proposed joining forces with Canada to provide a far stronger opponent to Philadelphia. If the Canadians do accept, then surely the ultimatum will never be rejected, as the risks for our rivals would simply be too great. But of course that is only the case if we consider Canada's help at all, let alone Ottawa accepts. The same advisors seem to believe we have nothing to lose in simply requesting aid from Canada in our efforts... but others are slightly sceptical about the complexities of bringing a major power on the American continent into this relatively small issue. After all, Ottawa's leadership could easily take advantage of a rejected ultimatum, invading our rivals and taking New York for themselves."
 rebel.16.o1:0 "Get help from Canada"
 rebel.16.o2:0 "Go alone"
 rebel.17.t:0 "New England's Ultimatum"
 rebel.17.d:0 "King [AMC.GetLeader] has called the Canadian cabinet to discuss an ultimatum his government will soon be sending to Philadelphia for consideration. The phone call was initially cordial, but rapidly became heated once the monarch requested Canadian help in influencing their rival government to fold. Some cabinet members demand the Prime Minister immediately hang up and reject these requests for the sake of peace in our time, while others rejected their colleagues, demanding instead that [CAN.GetLeader] immediately join in on the attack. The phone call ended without a formal decision, so our government must take one path as soon as possible before the opportunity is gone."
 rebel.17.o1:0 "We will help"
 rebel.17.o2:0 "Canada won't be on your side"
 rebel.18.t:0 "[AMC.GetLeader] Demands New York"
 rebel.18.d:0 "King [AMC.GetLeader] has delivered an unconditional ultimatum to Philadelphia through discreet channels crossing national borders. The sole demand of this ultimatum concerns an immediate transfer of administrative control over the state of New York from us to the Kingdom of New England. Upon hearing of the ultimatum from [Root.GetLeader], some within the government even burst out laughing. After all, New England is insignificant compared to the military and industrial might of [Root.GetName].

For an extended period of time, the Kingdom of New England will continue to pay us handsomely for the transfer, and in return they have presented themselves as a key player on the world stage, despite their small size.

Now that day has come, and delegates from various nations have already arrived in the city to unprecedented fanfare, with supporters cheering on every single limousine that arrived at the designated five star hotel. There representatives mingled and discussed what this intriguing conference could hold in store for them. Eventually the President arrived to escort them out of the hotel and towards the recently constructed New Boston Convention Centre, where millions of Americans had gathered just outside to witness the birth of a new era for them and their children. Only some members of the media were allowed inside as the Convention officially began, but sources confirmed that every single delegate was eager to hear what the [AMC.GetLeader] had to say. Lasting almost nine hours, the grand conference concluded and each nation's representative returned home to discuss what had been proposed to their head of state.

Despite cries from her party begging her to stay, Sotomayor has refused to stay for another term repeatedly stating that Sanders and herself were not elected officials and therefore had no further mandate to lead the nation. With the loss of Sotomayor, the mother of the revolution, the Socialist Party will now begin the task of searching for a new candidate to represent the moderate left of the Commonwealth.

Instead, it came as a surprise to many to see former President Sonia Sotomayor come to the stage and proudly nominate [AMC.GetLeader] as her successor.

As a result, the government has announced that a referendum will be held in the coming months to either decide on a new flag for the country or to officialize the temporary flag."

 rebel.94.d:0 "After weeks of debate and thousands of proposals, Congress has finally decided on four possible options for the new flag of the American Commonwealth. The four proposals are based on different aspects of the Commonwealth’s history and national identity and have been chosen based on their aesthetic appeal and perceived popularity among the people of the Commonwealth. The proposed flags include the “Rose Flag”, depicting America’s national flower and thirteen horizontal stripes, the “Sic Semper Tyrannis” flag, consisting of a traditional American flag with the Commonwealth’s national seal replacing the stars in the top-left canton, a diagonal tricolor flag with a white star in the top-left corner, and a flag inspired by Benjamin Franklin’s famous 1754 “Join, or Die” political cartoon. Although the nation has been gripped by the possibility of altering the state flag and forging a new identity on the international scene, there remains a lingering movement campaigning for the Commonwealth to maintain the modified Vermont flag, seeing it as the embodiment of the Third American Revolution regardless of its apparent bias. Following a hard-fought campaign, the Revolutionary War flag will appear on the ballot and at the end of the count may remain the nation's flag despite the referendum initially being focused on its removal."

After months of grassroots activity led by Illinois organizer Rich Whitney, dozens of revolutionary socialist groups have now convened at the Chicago Teachers Council Centre to formally reconstitute the historic Party of Labor, with the tacit blessing of the still-disgraced former president, Noam Chomsky. Presiding over this refounding effort is John Kerry, the veteran politician and former Secretary of the Interior, who has been unanimously elected as party chairman. Under his leadership, the restored Party of Labor seeks to channel the revolutionary spirit that ended the Democratic Labor Party's authoritarian rule into a democratic and electoral movement. While concerns linger over the radicalism of the party, in light of the fierce conflict with the New Guard regime, the Party of Labor has been adamant in its internal discipline, purging any remnants of New Guardist sympathies and declaring an uncompromising allegiance to the values of democracy, constitutionalism, and the preservation of our Commonwealth's hard-won liberties."

Motivated by the horrifying rise of the so-called White Phoenix, Mike Pence, to the presidency of the newly formed American State, these officers have seemingly recognized that their oaths belong not to any one government or ideology but to the American people themselves. While skepticism naturally lingered among many within the Commonwealth, given that these officers once fought to suppress the very ideals we now defend, President Sotomayor has been quick to accept the arrival of these officers, seeing their defection as a necessity to ensure the continued reconciliation of the divides that have persisted throughout America since 1987. While it is expected that these defectors will be placed under significant scrutiny and the ever-watchful eye of our state security forces for the foreseeable future, we have ensured that, by embracing these defectors, our American Commonwealth has bolstered our military strength and, perhaps more importantly, reaffirmed our commitment to forgiveness, justice, and the enduring struggle for a free republic."

Among its leading figures are Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, a seasoned anti-communist voice in foreign affairs, Massachusetts’ Bill Weld, who calls for sweeping reforms in regulatory policy, and John Babiarz of New Hampshire, whose libertarian flank appeals to younger urban voters disillusioned with both Whigs and Radicals. Together, they have sought to offer a programme that seeks a leaner state, greater market freedoms, and a more aggressive stance against leftist movements both at home and abroad. Though still lacking nationwide infrastructure, the party’s founding congress in Hartford drew considerable attention. With President Sotomayor stepping away and the Whigs fractured over the post-revolutionary order, the 2016 race promises to be the most unpredictable since the Commonwealth’s founding"

Chief among them is Governor Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, a political veteran and leader of the Moderate Wing of the Socialist Party, who has quickly garnered the support of organizers and urban professionals. However, while Dukakis has been the voice of stability and continuation with Sotomayor, he has been challenged chiefly by Representative Nina Turner, the party’s most prominent firebrand, who has electrified younger activists with her denunciations of compromise and calls for sweeping institutional change. Likewise, Governor Ralph Nader of Connecticut has built upon Turner's populism, however, seeking to move it instead towards ecosocialism, linking economic justice with climate urgency. Finally, Bill “Spaceman” Lee has emerged as a wildcard for many, while a committed internationalist and open admirer of Havana, the former Red Sox pitcher has been unable to break away from the belief that his candidacy is anything but a joke, despite the grassroots of Maine and Vermont embracing his policies."

Alliance strategists increasingly believe that voter fatigue with ideological upheaval has created space for a more technocratic, liberal alternative. Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo has emerged as an early favourite among party modernisers. A pragmatic fiscal liberal, she argues the Commonwealth must move beyond revolutionary socialism toward competent governance, institutional stability, and investor confidence. New Hampshire Governor Maggie Hassan represents a different strain, framing the Alliance as the natural home for feminist politics, insisting both left and right have failed to deliver genuine economic equality for women. New York Senator Andrew Cuomo has positioned himself as the experienced hand, openly invoking his father Mario’s role in shaping the post-revolutionary constitution and arguing that only seasoned leadership can steer the republic through uncertain waters. Meanwhile, Representative and retired Admiral Joe Sestak remains a consensus fallback: uncontroversial, disciplined, and leaning heavily on his military credentials to anchor the party’s defence platform."

For a movement born out of liberal Whig splits, anti-communist realignment, and post-revolutionary fatigue, the primary is as much a proof of life as it is a search for leadership. New Hampshire Representative John Babiarz, the intellectual figurehead of the party’s libertarian wing, has positioned himself as the clearest ideologue in the race. Championing minimal government, civil liberties, and a sharp rollback of Socialist Party economic controls, Babiarz appeals strongly to younger activists and defectors from the right. By contrast, Massachusetts Representative Bill Weld has emerged as the preferred option of the party centre, advocating a restrained but functional state that can methodically unwind what he calls the “excesses of revolutionary governance.” Virginia State Senator Jim Webb is running a distant campaign focused less on delegates than on influence, openly courting party elder Joe Lieberman, whose endorsement remains conspicuously absent. Rounding out the field is Susan Eisenhower, the race’s sole serious female contender, who is leveraging family legacy and a promise of sober, republican restoration to carve out space in an otherwise fractious contest."

Across the American Commonwealth, polling stations opened this morning for what many are calling the most consequential election since the Third American Revolution. Conducted under a radically redesigned system, ranked-choice voting, the abolition of the Electoral College, and a nationally mandated holiday, the vote is intended as both a democratic corrective and a stress test of the Socialist Party of America’s stewardship of the post-revolutionary state. Turnout is expected to be unprecedented. Millions of newly enfranchised voters, politicised by the revolution and its aftermath, are entering the system for the first time. Their preferences are reshaping politics along increasingly clear regional blocs, where local economic interests, attitudes toward socialism, and reactions to federal authority matter more than old party labels ever did. For the SPA, the election is a referendum on governance rather than ideology alone. A strong presidential showing could carry allies into Congress, statehouses, and municipal governments, accelerating consolidation of power. A weaker result, however, risks emboldening challengers across the ballot and fracturing the fragile consensus that has held since victory was declared.

This week, the party opened its first-ever national convention, signalling a deliberate shift in tone rather than doctrine. The emphasis, party officials say privately, is no longer merely competence, but connection. The convention’s embrace of populism is calculated. With memories of revolutionary unity fading and new opposition movements gaining confidence, SPA strategists are keenly aware that success alone rarely sustains enthusiasm. Instead, the party has turned outward, seeking language and figures that resonate beyond its traditional urban and academic base. The choice of speakers reflects this recalibration. Among the most prominent was Jimmy Vance, author of Redneck Elegy, whose blend of class-conscious rhetoric, military service, and cultural conservatism has made him an unlikely but compelling socialist messenger. Now running for the Senate in Ohio against Unity for America stalwart John Kasich, Vance embodies the party’s effort to fuse populist identity with left-wing economics. Whether this recalibration deepens the SPA’s coalition or merely blurs its message remains uncertain. But the convention leaves little doubt: the party intends not just to govern, but to endure."

This week, the two parties jointly unveiled a shared primary process under the banner of the Democratic Unity coalition, allowing members of both organizations to vote together on a single presidential nominee to appear on both ballots at the state level. It is an admission, privately conceded by strategists in both camps, that fragmentation has become a luxury the opposition can no longer afford. The field reflects a careful balancing act. Sanford Bishop, a long-serving Representative from Georgia, represents the softer, more communitarian wing of UfA politics, pitching himself as a bridge to Democratic Alliance voters through an emphasis on civil rights modernization and black political empowerment. Andy Beshear, the recently elected Governor of Kentucky, is being touted as proof that social liberalism can still win in conservative terrain. Deval Patrick, Massachusetts Attorney General, offers liberal continuity and executive polish, while Steve Bullock brings a sterner reputation, shaped by his high-profile role chairing Montana’s Reconciliation Commission.

After five years of uninterrupted Socialist Party rule, the electorate is being asked to decide whether the revolutionary government deserves another mandate, or whether it is time for liberalism and centrism to correct what critics increasingly describe as ideological overreach. For the Socialists, the contest is framed as a second referendum on stability. Party leaders argue that the SPA has transformed a fractured post-revolutionary society into a functioning republic, expanded social protections, and embedded democratic norms such as ranked-choice voting and universal participation. To abandon that project now, they warn, would risk undoing hard-won gains and empowering forces that never fully accepted the Third Revolution. The opposition, united under the Democratic Unity banner, offers a different diagnosis. While careful to distance themselves from pre-revolutionary excesses, liberal and centrist leaders argue that socialism has begun to stagnate into complacency, crowding out local initiative and economic flexibility. They promise competence, moderation, and a recalibration rather than a rollback. With turnout expected to be historic once again, this election will not merely choose a president.

Held amid carefully choreographed displays of unity, the gathering leaned heavily on the language of institutional restoration: liberty secured, democracy stabilized, progress made incremental rather than revolutionary. Party leaders framed the past five years as proof that the post-revolutionary republic can be governed without ideological excess. Repeated references were made to economic normalisation, the strengthening of independent courts, and the steady reintegration of the Commonwealth into global markets. Another DA term, delegates were told, would mean consolidation rather than experimentation. The convention’s most discussed moment, however, came not from a politician but from popular culture. Actor Kevin Fowler, famous for portraying a principled president in the long-running television drama Resolute Desk, delivered the traditional roll call of states entirely in character. The performance, equal parts theatrical and self-aware, drew sustained applause and underlined the party’s message: competence, calm authority, and familiarity.

The coalition brings together an uneasy but potentially potent mix of personalities. Marianne Williamson, the SPA’s Texas chair, has emerged as a base favourite, her blend of insurgent socialism and unorthodox spiritual rhetoric resonating strongly with grassroots activists hungry for renewal. By contrast, Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey represents the party’s institutional memory: cautious, procedural, and openly committed to preserving socialism’s legislative gains rather than expanding them recklessly.From the DPP side, Rhode Island Senator Jack Reed, the party’s leader and a former Democratic Labor figure, argues for a disciplined repositioning of the left, warning that ideological overreach could doom any return to power.

Framing the vote as a referendum on economic justice, coalition figures insist that only a reunited working-class movement can stabilise the republic in the long term. The governing Democratic Alliance, by contrast, is campaigning on continuity and calm. Its leadership argues that the last term has restored institutional credibility, moderated the excesses of revolutionary politics, and re-established America as a functional democracy rather than an ideological battleground. Five more years, they claim, would consolidate these gains and finally put the upheavals of the Third Revolution to rest. Beyond these two poles, the field is thin. Unity for America is widely viewed as a spoiler, lacking both organizational depth and a coherent national message, while the Party of Labor remains confined largely to down-ballot relevance in traditionally socialist states.

Delegates repeatedly pointed to steady growth, functional institutions, and a marked decline in political violence as proof that the UfA’s cautious centrism has delivered where others promised too much. The convention’s most closely watched moment came with a keynote address by Florida Representative Barry Obama, whose speech deliberately echoed an optimistic appeal to unity, shared purpose, and an America defined less by faction than by common civic duty. Framed as a reminder of what hopeful politics can sound like without tipping into populism, the address drew prolonged applause from the hall and favourable early commentary from political editors. Still, there was an unmistakable air of anxiety beneath the choreography. With voters increasingly polarized between liberal continuity and a resurgent left, Unity for America’s pitch rests on a simple wager: that competence, once demonstrated, is enough.

The early field reflects this search for renewed purpose. New Jersey Senator Cory Booker has positioned himself as the candidate of unity and uplift, leaning heavily on the language of hope, civic renewal, and cross-partisan inspiration. New York Governor Kirsten Gillibrand, by contrast, has cast herself as a forceful feminist reformer, presenting her candidacy as uncompromised by entrenched interests and explicitly national rather than factional in outlook. Colorado Senator Michael Bennet has adopted a more technocratic tone, focusing on education and healthcare reform while arguing that the Alliance’s 2016 defeat stemmed from a disconnect with everyday voters rather than ideological weakness.

Jesse Jackson, the legendary organizer and long-serving Mayor of Chicago, has entered the race promising to replicate the coalition-building that drove the left together across America, speaking openly of moral revival, multiracial unity, and a left that remembers how to win.

Socialism, the party insists, has proven itself not merely radical, but responsible, popular, and unmistakably democratic. Yet the convention itself has felt curiously flat. There were no breakout figures, no moments of theatre or confrontation. Beyond Kerry’s own two-hour address, part lecture, part moral appeal on the historic necessity of the PoL, the stage remained largely empty. Delegates applauded dutifully, banners were waved, but enthusiasm rarely spilled beyond the hall’s walls. This was a convention of reassurance rather than inspiration, aimed more at consolidating loyalists than expanding horizons.

The dividing lines are clear, almost stark. For the PoL, socialism is no longer an abstract aspiration but a lived system, embedded in neighborhood councils, workplace committees, and an expanding web of community associations that double as political machines.

A very different challenge comes from Howard Schultz, a former representative of the Union of American People's Republics turned transnational executive, who launched his campaign in the unassuming sprawl of Tobyhanna Township, presenting himself as a force for positivity amid what he calls a disappointing political class. Veteran UfA figure George Pataki offers steadiness and patriotic respectability, while Colorado Senator Jared Polis unsettles the alliance from within, blending progressive social instincts with economic libertarianism in an attempt to shock the coalition into relevance. United less by vision than by opposition, Democratic Unity survives, stubborn, uneasy, and increasingly desperate to prove it still matters."

For the first time since the Third American Revolution, voters are being asked not merely to choose a president, but to pass judgment on a decade and a half of uninterrupted Socialist Party governance. Fifteen years is a long time in any democracy, and even allies privately concede that permanence, not policy, has become the SPA’s greatest vulnerability. The Socialists enter the race with formidable advantages. Their dense network of unions, cooperatives, and community associations remains unmatched, particularly in post-industrial cities and the rural periphery they have deliberately cultivated. To supporters, this is proof of democratic vitality; to critics, it resembles an ecosystem designed to perpetuate itself. SPA figures insist the choice is simple: stability, national ownership, and social guarantees versus an untested return to market liberalism. Facing them, the Democratic Unity Coalition senses its best opportunity yet. Having shed much of its earlier hesitancy, it now presents itself as a broad civic front rather than an ideological project, a vehicle for voters who feel the revolution has congealed into orthodoxy. Whether fatigue finally outweighs loyalty remains uncertain. What is clear is that this election will decide whether socialism is America’s settled destination, or merely a prolonged chapter."

It was in this mood that the party convened its first national convention since regaining office, an event as much about self-critique as celebration. Speeches repeatedly returned to a single theme: readiness. Delegates were urged to treat the next few months as a proving ground, demonstrating that socialism in America is not merely moral or popular, but durable, competent, and capable of governing at scale. Organizers were warned against insularity, factional indulgence, and the assumption that the electorate’s patience is infinite. The message from the platform was clear: failure in 2026 would not be forgiven as easily as failure in 2016 had been. Providing a lighter but pointed counterweight, actor and comedian Paul F. Tompkins delivered the roll call, blending irony with earnestness. His presence revealed the convention’s ambition: to appear confident without arrogance, hopeful without naïveté.

Determined not to repeat the spoiler-ridden collapse that handed the presidency back to the socialists, the DA and UfA have agreed to a formal electoral pact under the deliberately resonant banner of the Patriots for Democracy Platform. The language is careful: this is not restoration, nor revolution, but containment. Four figures now dominate the early manoeuvring. Massachusetts Governor Joe Kennedy III offers a familiar surname stripped of myth, selling liberal populism carefully fenced within democratic restraint. Charlie Baker, formerly Treasury Secretary, presents himself as the competent corrective, fiscally cautious, socially liberal, and pitched squarely at voters uneasy with ideological excess yet dissatisfied with socialist governance. From the UfA’s harder edge, Kentucky’s junior senator Thomas Massie frames the contest in constitutional terms, pledging to roll back what he calls the post-2016 expansion of state power to the limits of the 1987 settlement. Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski, meanwhile, positions herself as the coalition’s ballast: centrist, institutionalist, and explicitly opposed to the extremes that now define American politics.

Party officials speak confidently of institutional depth, community mobilization, and a generation of voters for whom socialism is no longer an aberration but a norm. Yet the challenge is formidable. The anti-socialist opposition, regrouped and sharpened after successive failures, argues that the last five years have exposed the limits of ideological governance. They warn of stagnation, overreach, and the quiet erosion of democratic pluralism beneath a dominant party system. Their message resonates most strongly in suburban and ex-industrial regions, where fatigue rather than fervour now shapes political mood. At stake is more than victory or defeat.

At the centre of the race stands Michigan Attorney General Gretchen Whitmer, widely viewed as the continuity candidate, embodying administrative competence and the cautious reformism that has defined the Alliance’s years in power. Her support within the party apparatus is deep, if not always enthusiastic. Challenging her is Colorado Senator John Hickenlooper, who argues that the Alliance risks stagnation unless it adopts a more openly progressive posture, particularly on labour and infrastructure. A parallel appeal comes from Jay Inslee, now Secretary of the Interior, whose campaign is framed around environmental urgency and technocratic credibility, drawing notable backing from scientists and policy experts. Lurking on the margins is Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs, a dark horse sustained largely by regional loyalty and a reputation for fiscal sobriety, budget discipline, and managerial restraint.

Party officials frame the experiment as a necessary corrective rather than an ideological retreat, arguing that unity on the left is the only viable route back to relevance. The field reflects that balancing act. Carl Gershman of New York, a senior DPP figure active since the 1970s, presents himself as the embodiment of administrative competence, promising a socialized government that works rather than one that merely agitates.

Pennsylvania Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman offers a sharper contrast: inexperienced by his own admission, but buoyed by grassroots enthusiasm for his blunt, norm-defying style and cultivated outsider image.

For the Democratic Alliance, the case rests on continuity. Party strategists argue that ten years of liberal rule have delivered institutional repair, predictable governance, and a measured retreat from the excesses of revolutionary politics. Their campaign has leaned heavily on competence and caution, warning that a fractured or emboldened left could reopen old wounds the Commonwealth can scarcely afford to revisit. Yet the Socialist–Democratic coalition senses an opening. By fusing socialist organisation with the DPP’s softer democratic branding, it hopes to capitalise on voter fatigue and growing unease over inequality, housing, and the limits of technocratic reform.

The headline announcement came early: a formal endorsement from Unity for America, unveiled to sustained applause and presented as proof that the Alliance’s governing project has broadened rather than narrowed its appeal. Speakers stressed that this was not a merger of convenience, but a shared recognition that five further years of DA leadership would safeguard democratic norms, fiscal responsibility, and social progress without succumbing to ideological excess. The convention was notably lighter in tone than past revolutionary gatherings. Cultural segments, humour, and music were deliberately foregrounded, with late-night host Bill Maher appearing as a featured guest, delivering a characteristically satirical monologue aimed as much at socialist dogma as at reactionary populism.

The shared primary has quickly taken on the tone of a generational and philosophical reckoning. Greg Casar, the young socialist congressman from Texas and SPA whip, has positioned himself as the coalition’s insurgent voice, courting youth activists and organized labor with promises of renewal rather than restoration. By contrast, Dean Phillips, the DPP congressman from Minnesota, offers what he calls people’s liberalism: fiscally cautious, openly supportive of public–private partnerships, and sceptical of ideological purity on the left. Further left sits Ben Jealous, SPA governor of Maryland, whose campaign leans heavily on moral urgency and expansive visions of justice, pledging to scale the so-called “Baltimore Solution” nationwide.

The roll call, delivered by actor Don Cheadle, lent a polished populism to proceedings, proving the DPP’s effort to balance cultural reach with institutional seriousness. Party leaders used the convention to emphasise their self-image as stewards of a fair but disciplined economy, arguing that growth, redistribution, and stability are no longer competing priorities but mutually reinforcing ones. Repeated references were made to cooperation with both the Socialists and the Party of Labor, presented not as concessions but as evidence of a broad governing consensus capable of delivering legislation efficiently.

Under the shared American Democracy ticket, the two parties are attempting to present a disciplined, results-oriented alternative to DPP governance, while carefully managing their internal differences. The field reflects this balancing act. Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear leads a deliberately understated campaign, placing emphasis not on charisma but on administrative competence and measurable outcomes. Maryland Senator and former Governor Larry Hogan positions himself as a populist maverick, courting voters fatigued by ideology and drawn to managerial independence. Roy Cooper, now Senator from North Carolina, trades on experience and continuity, evoking his close ties to the last DA presidency as proof of steady hands in uncertain times.

Supporters argue this period has delivered predictability and protection in uncertain times; critics counter that it has entrenched bureaucratic excess and dulled democratic dynamism. Challenging that record is the American Democracy ticket, a joint effort by the Democratic Alliance and Unity for America, which has framed the election as a referendum on the size and scope of government itself.

Despite sustained pressure from activists and donors alike, Senator Rand Paul has again declined to stand, instead casting himself as kingmaker-in-chief, pledging to oversee the nomination process personally, while embarking on an aggressive media tour designed to ensure that Liberty and Salvation become unavoidable slogans by November. The emerging field reflects the party’s unresolved tensions. Marvin Bush, a member of the Bush family but carefully distanced from its governing legacy, leads the moderate libertarian wing, enjoying the backing of Liberty and Salvation’s sparse but symbolically important elected officials. Jo Jorgensen, a South Carolina-based university professor, occupies similar ideological ground, advocating classical liberalism and what she describes as common-sense libertarian governance, with particular appeal to activists wary of extremism. Further to the right sits Floridian economist Mike ter Maat, who calls for sweeping reductions in the size of the state, though stopping short of outright abolition. That position is left to Adam Kokesh, a reunification war veteran whose platform proposes the managed dissolution of the federal government itself, with Kokesh appointing himself its temporary custodian. Whether voters are ready for such radical clarity remains an open question."

 rebel.139.t:0 "2026 Democratic Alliance Primaries"
 rebel.139.d:0 "In the long run-up to the 2026 presidential elections, the Democratic Alliance has found itself reshaped by circumstance rather than conviction. The collapse of Unity for America has sent a steady stream of moderates and administrators into the DA’s ranks, hardening its instincts and nudging the party toward a more disciplined, market-friendly liberalism. The result is a primary field that reflects both adaptation and unease. California Governor Gavin Newsom enters as the dominant figure: a polished orator and pragmatic operator, widely regarded as a skilled political tactician and a firm opponent of socialism, whose anti-communist rhetoric has reassured business interests and former UfA voters alike. Wisconsin Senator Tammy Baldwin offers a contrasting profile. She is a veteran legislator with deep congressional experience and a broadly progressive voting record, positioning herself as a bridge between the party’s older liberal base and its newer arrivals. Eric Swalwell, another Californian, lacks comparable stature but has quietly attracted support from UfA moderates and traditional DA liberals seeking a generational shift. Meanwhile, Maine Senator Jared Golden, himself a former UfA member, advances an unusual creed of progressive conservatism, arguing for strong, well-funded local government insulated from an increasingly distant federal centre. Together, they illustrate a party still deciding what it has become to survive the next decade."
 rebel.139.o1:0 "Newsom, abundancy, action and America."
 rebel.139.o2:0 "Tammy for America!."
 rebel.139.o3:0 "Swalwell, America’s True Future."
 rebel.139.o4:0 "America’s Golden opportunity awaits!."
 rebel.140.t:0 "2026 Presidential Election"
 rebel.140.d:0 "The moment long anticipated has arrived. The 2026 presidential election opens under conditions unlike any in modern American history, with a rigid three-party system no longer theoretical but fully imposed upon the political landscape. Liberalism, socialism, and a newly emboldened libertarian radicalism now contend openly for power, each claiming not merely victory, but legitimacy itself. What was once dismissed as fragmentation has hardened into structure. For the Democratic Alliance, this election is framed as a referendum on stability and competence after a decade of upheaval, offering continuity against what it warns are ideological experiments. The Party of Labor, by contrast, presents the vote as a final reckoning with capitalism’s long shadow, promising to complete the unfinished work of President Kerry and restore political power to labor and the state. Hovering uneasily at the margins, Liberty and Salvation advance a far more destabilizing vision, openly questioning whether the federal system itself should survive intact. Turnout is expected to be historic, not from optimism but anxiety. Institutions strain under competing mandates, rhetoric grows sharper by the day, and even veteran observers speak quietly of constitutional stress. The machinery of American democracy still turns, but audibly, and with visible cracks."
 rebel.140.o1:0 "The revolution is unending!."
 rebel.140.o2:0 "Keep Hope Alive, Keep America Alive!."
 rebel.140.o3:0 "America must be saved from another 1987."
