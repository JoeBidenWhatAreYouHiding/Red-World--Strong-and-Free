 # IDEAS

  MEX_Narco_State:0 "Narco-State"
  MEX_Narco_State_desc:0 "Since the collapse of the United States, the Cartels have been allowed to grow unchecked; and with the American successor states being a hotbed of tension and lawlessness, these Cartels have been granted a lucrative new market to push their poison. While the various American governments have tried to reconstruct the DEA, these efforts have proved fruitless. Indeed, it seems that neither Mexican nor American governments can do anything to stop the rampant Drug Trade that plagues the region."
  MEX_Cartel_Dominance:0 "Mexican Drug War"
  MEX_Cartel_Dominance_desc:0 "While the Reagan Administration's 'War on Drugs' was nothing more than a hypothetical war on vice, in Mexico the War on Drugs is very much a war in the traditional sense. The Mexican Military currently wages a seemingly hopeless battle against all-powerful Drug Cartels, leaving countless dead and the country in utter chaos. While President Felipe Calderón attempted to defeat these powerful Cartels via Military action, his campaign was met with utter failure; and ultimately, his attempts at cracking down on the Narcos would lead to his own death by assassination in 2009."
  MEX_Weak_Federal_Government:0 "Weak Federal Government"
  MEX_Weak_Federal_Government_desc:0 "The Mexican Federal Government was originally modeled on the United States, and unfortunately it appears that it may end in much the same way. The way the Mexican Federal Government operates allows extensive autonomy to State Governments. While this has allowed the Mexican nation to survive through political turmoil, this high degree of autonomy has allowed State governments to either ignore, or in many cases, actively support political corruption. "
  MEX_American_Refugees:0 "Inmigrante Influx"
  MEX_American_Refugees_desc:0 "While most American Refugees set their sights towards Canada, a not insignificant number of Americans, predominantly in the Southern United States decided to flee to Mexico in hopes for a better life. While they had thought that anything would be better than the war-torn Former United States, the omnipresence of the Cartels and horrific Labour regulation has many of these 'Americanos' finding themselves toiling in unsafe conditions, or being kidnapped by the Cartels."
  MEX_Nueva_Mexico_Occupation:0 "The American Occupations"
  MEX_Nueva_Mexico_Occupation_desc:0 "Mexico moved to seize certain parts of the former Mexican Cession in the wake of the United States' collapse. While this was driven to avenge a centuries-long humiliation, the occupation of New Mexico and Southern Texas has led to more humiliation than we could have ever predicted. It seems that our occupation of New Mexico, now referred to as 'Nueva Mexico', has been nothing short of a disaster for Mexico, as both locals and the Mexican-American minority have been completely unwilling to cooperate with the Mexican government. This has led to New Mexico and Southern Texas becoming lawless wastelands, with the Mexican Federal Government proving unable to provide these regions with law enforcement and basic services."
  MEX_War_On_Drugs:0 "War on Drugs"
  MEX_War_On_Drugs_desc:0 "The Mexican War on Drugs has grown into a War in every sense of the word. The Cartel-backed 'Mexican Confederation' has risen up in the north, and is now engaged in a bloody battle for supremacy with the remains of the Mexican Federal Government."
  MEX_War_On_Drugs_Cartel:0 "Mexican Civil War"
 MEX_War_On_Drugs_Cartel_desc:0 "The Mexican War on Drugs has grown into a War in every sense of the word. The Cartel-backed 'Mexican Confederation' has risen up in the north, and is now engaged in a bloody battle for supremacy with the remains of the Mexican Federal Government."

  rwmex_news.25.d:0 "In a dark new turn for the Mexican War on Drugs, several Cartel groups advanced on Mexico City, entering the Palacio Nacional and killing Mexican President Emilio González Márquez. Márquez himself took over after the assassination of his predecessor Felipe Calderón, and governed through the tumult of countless political assassinations. In addition to the execution of the Mexican President, countless deputies and other civil servants, in an incident which is being referred to across the nation as the 'Day of Spilt Blood'. Now, with Mexico's government dead, it is seemingly only a matter of time before the Cartels move to replace the Federal Government wholesale."
  rwmex_news.25.o1:0 "How Dark." 
      
  rwmex_news.26.t:0 "The Cienfuegos Rebellion"
  rwmex_news.26.d:0 "In the wake of the Mexican Government's murder, popular General Salvador Cienfuegos has launched a rebellion in the north of Mexico against the now nonexistent Mexican Federal Government. This rebellion, while claiming to be against the 'Illegitimate' Socialist government in Mexico City, appears to be backed entirely by the Cartels. The newly-minted 'Mexican Confederation' has risen up in the North of Mexico, and in territories almost exclusively held by the Cartels. While small portions of the Mexican military have defected to Cienfuegos' side, the vast majority of the rebellion is backed by the Mexican Drug Cartels, who have temporarily made peace to focus on defeating the Mexican Government."
  rwmex_news.26.o1:0 "Mexico enters chaos once more." 
  
  rwmex_news.27.t:0 "Nueva Mexico Rebellion"
  rwmex_news.27.d:0 "In a strange new turn in the Mexican War on Drugs, the powerful Mexican Sinaloa Cartel has pooled their vast resources to seize control of the Mexican State of Nueva Mexico. Nueva Mexico is famous for struggling with law enforcement matters, partly due to restless locals who resent the Mexican Federal Government for occupying the territory after the collapse of the United States. This newly-created 'República de Nuevo México' has cited the 'Illegal Mexican Occupation' as their casus belli for succession, however observers have noted that this declaration is almost entirely as a result of Mexico's war against the Drug Cartels. This new nation is run almost entirely by the Sinaloa Cartel and other sympathetic Criminal Groups who seek to create their own Criminal Paradise away from the Mexican Government's reaches. "

  rwmex_news.28.t:0 "Drug Lords Secure Mexico"
  rwmex_news.28.d:0 "It seems that the long and bloody Mexican 'Narco War' has finally come to an end. The remnants of the Mexican Federal Government have fled as a loose alliance of Drug Cartels have now managed to secure the entirety of the former United States of Mexico. Now, General Salvador Cienfuegos, leader of the rebellion has been proclaimed as Mexico's New President in a grand ceremony in Mexico City. Cienfuegos's new regime has been dubbed as a return to the Porfiriato, taking power almost 100 years ago after the fall of the original one. This new shadow Porfiriato, while publicly a Technocratic Military Dictatorship, is secretly backed by a vast coalition of Drug Cartels who banded together to fight the Mexican Government. With the Mexican Government gone, it seems likely that these once united groups will soon resort to tearing each other apart in a vicious battle for supremacy."
  rwmex_news.28.o1:0 "Congratulations to Drugs for winning the War on Drugs."
      
  rwmex_news.29.t:0 "'El Chapo' Inaugurated"
  rwmex_news.29.d:0 "It seems that the long and bloody Mexican 'Narco War' has finally come to an end. The remnants of the Mexican Federal Government have fled as a loose alliance of Drug Cartels have now managed to secure the entirety of the former United States of Mexico. General Salvador Cienfuegos, leader of the rebellion, has stepped aside to allow Joaquín Guzmán, better known as 'El Chapo', to be sworn in as Mexican President. 'El Chapo' is the head of the notorious Sinaloa Cartel, which has become the largest power-player in the New Mexico. This brazen seizure of power by Guzmán has thrown a wrench in the previous alliance of Cartels against the Government, and now it seems likely that these once united groups will soon resort to tearing each other apart in a vicious battle for supremacy."
  rwmex_news.29.o1:0 "Congratulations to Drugs for winning the War on Drugs."
  
  rwmex_news.30.t:0 "Mexican Democracy Restored"
  rwmex_news.30.d:0 "It seems that the long and bloody Mexican 'Narco War' has finally come to an end. The remnants of the Mexican Federal Government have fled as a loose alliance of Drug Cartels have now managed to secure the entirety of the former United States of Mexico. Now, General Salvador Cienfuegos, leader of the rebellion has been instructed to step down and make way for 'Free' and 'Fair' elections to be held. These elections have been won in a landslide by Cartel-backed candidate Manuel Bartlett, who has run under the ticket of the restored PRI. The restored Federal Government is secretly backed by a vast coalition of Drug Cartels who banded together to fight the Mexican Government. With the old Mexican Government gone, it seems likely that these once united groups will soon resort to tearing each other apart in a vicious battle for supremacy."
  rwmex_news.30.o1:0 "The rule of the Cartels Secured."
  
  rwmex_news.31.t:0 "Cienfuegos Rebellion Ends"
  rwmex_news.31.d:0 "The ill-fated rebellion started by Cartel-backed General Salvador Cienfuegos has finally been defeated by the Mexican Government. General Cienfuegos, as well as major players of the failed rebellion were taken into custody today, signalling the end of the so-called 'Mexican Civil War'. This war marked the escelation of the Mexican War on Drugs into a full-scale civil conflict between competing governments. With the Cartel uprising defeated, it appears that the Narcos have been dealt a significant blow. While their attempts to replace the Mexican Government wholesale has failed, the Cartels still remain a powerful albeit weakened force working in the Mexican underground economy."
