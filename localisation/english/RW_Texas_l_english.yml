 POLITICS_TEX_RICK_PERRY_DESC:0 "Rick Perry was first elected to the Texas House of Representatives in 1984, and was one of the first state representatives to call for an independent Republic of Texas in the wake of the Great American Collapse in 1987. A staunch Texan nationalist, he supported harsher measures against the agitation of American loyalists, and would personally fly several airlift missions during the Mexican-Texan War. In the ever-changing political landscape of independent Texas, Perry aligned with the majority of the Democratic Party in drafting a constitution for the newly independent country. He then served as Minister of Defense under President Lloyd Bentsen, his service in the war making him the clear choice to rebuild the Texan military. However, internal divisions within the Democratic Party would force Perry out of power for nearly a decade, and he spent most of the nineties working in the energy industry. He wouldn’t return to the political scene until 2000, when President Kay Hutchinson signed a controversial trade agreement with the American Republic. Organizing the opposition to the continuing AR occupation of eastern Texas, Perry united Texan nationalists from both parties into the One Republic movement, the electoral vehicle for his 2001 presidential campaign. He won the election in a landslide and transformed One Republic into an official party which has dominated the political scene ever since. Perry’s two non-consecutive terms, interrupted only by the presidency of his protege David Dewhurst, have been dominated by security issues and the continued conflict with American loyalists. His administration established the Texas Enterprise Fund to funnell oil revenues towards economic expansion, and brought the country into the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, turning Texas into one of the world’s leading oil producers."

 TEX_Mutilated_Rose:0 "The Mutilated Rose"
 TEX_Mutilated_Rose_desc:0 "There was a time when Texas stood proud, free and truly independent. That was a long time ago. Modern Texas is a state reduced to a buffer, mutilated by repeated invasions from the Southern Remnants and the Mexican Army. Though Texas was the beneficiary of many post-Collapse military professionals, not even Alexander the Great could have overturned the Republic's myriad of losses on multiple fronts.\n\nModern Texas is a shadow of what it once was, and reclaiming her rightful place as a post-American nation is the principle goal of many in the political scene. Though few would be so brazen as to call it Revanchism, it is clear that the modern Texan cultural zeitgeist has shifted hard towards reclamation of her lost lands."
 
 TEX_New_Americans:0 "Legacy of May 29th"
 TEX_New_Americans_desc:0 "May 29th, 2009 remains one of the darkest moments in modern Texan history. While anti-secessionist sentiment has never been new, few could have anticipated the magnitude of the attack. Early in the morning, members of a group calling themselves the New Americans launched a series of bombings against Texan capital infrastructure, resulting in the deaths of nearly 80 people and the hospitalization of over 200. In conjunction with these attacks, Texan politicians were simultaneously mailed a series of anthrax-laced mail bombs, resulting in an additional death and a dozen injuries. In total, the attack caused millions of dollars in damages, and more importantly it utterly traumatized the Texan Republic.\n\nThe May 29th Attacks lead directly to the temporary imposition of a state of emergency, an act which has never been officially rescinded. President Rick Perry holds on to his emergency powers even now, riding on the fear and uncertainty of the December Attacks, but with the New Americans on the backfoot after retaliatory strikes, his justifications sound more and more hollow."
 
 TEX_Terrorist_Threat:0 "The Terrorist Threat"
 TEX_Terrorist_Threat_desc:0 "After countless attacks from Republic-aligned Terrorists, the people of Texas have grown to live in fear of the next attack. Anti-secessionist groups have used violent tactics to intimidate the good people of our Republic, and tragically it seems to have worked. As our nation stands paralyzed in fear, increasing calls to safeguard the safety of Texans has put both politicians and intelligence agencies under pressure. While many have lost faith in these institutions due to their failure to prevent both the May 29th and St. Patricks Day attack, the tragic loss of life during these dark days has instilled our military and intelligence forces with a drive to never let such events repeat. On the other hand, President Perry has continued using these events as a casus belli to expand the authorities of the Office of the President, leading some to accuse him of taking advantage of the situation, or worse, deliberately ignoring warning signs. As our Republic teeters on the brink of authoritarianism, one must wonder if a balance can be struck between our freedom and our security. "
 
 TEX_Remeber_March_Seventeen:0 "Remember March 17th!"
 
 TEX_One_Republic_Dominance:0 "One Republic Dominance"
 TEX_One_Republic_Dominance_desc:0 "Ever since the 'One Republic' Party was founded, it has enjoyed a nearly unchallenged monopoly on the Texan political scene. As the most prominent voice of the heavily nationalistic and revanchist Texas Republican movement, One Republic has successfully branded itself as the primary movement representing the interests of true Texan Patriots. The patriotic fervor started by the OR has secured their monopoly on power, but drawn increasing ire from those who think that Perry's policies now border on the tyrannical. Additionally, the stringent Social Conservatism of the Perry Administration has caused conflict between the Central Government and Hispanic and Urban voters."
 
 TEX_Second_Republic:0 "The Second Republic"
 TEX_Second_Republic_desc:0 "Texas. Hawaii. Vermont. California. All of these states have the unique claim to fame of once being self-governing nations. Of them all, none has taken such a fact to heart like the Second Republic of Texas. The intense patriotism drawn between our modern loss in pride and the American Annexation has birthed a movement of extreme anti-American and anti-Annexationist rhetoric, and increased patriotism surrounding traditional 'Texan' cultural staples such as Guns and Cowboys. However there have also been those who have drawn on Texas' history with the ill-fated Confederate States of America as an expression of anti-Annexationist nationalism; something which has not sat well with Texas' large African-American population."
 
 TEX_public_outrage:0 "Public Outrage"
 TEX_public_outrage_desc:0 "The Release of the 'Scarlet Dossier' has revealed a truly damning pattern of incompetence and complacency within our nation's highest offices. The fact that Perry ignored our nation's most prominent intelligence experts, and then covered up the truth in an attempt to make himself look like a hero has shattered public confidence in our government, and has led to sporadic protests ever since. Additionally, this has also led to a sharp uptick in conspiratorial thinking, as countless Texans now believe that Perry deliberately ignored warning signs, letting the attack take place so he could further his own power."

 TEX_president_perry:0 "President Perry"
 TEX_president_perry_desc:0 "Serving on and off as President since 2001, James Richard Perry now stands as the ruler of a deeply divided nation. With the specter of both internal terrorists and Remnant intervention looming, Texas is in a difficult position, and it seems that sooner or later, these tensions are going to erupt into a situation which cannot be controlled."
 TEX_rapid_response:0 "Rapid Response Teams"
 TEX_rapid_response_desc:0 "The damnable terrorists who attacked Houston have managed to catch the Republic's emergency services with their pants down. Wherever and whenever the next attack occurs, our emergency services must be up to the task of apprehending the masterminds and assisting the victims."
 TEX_media_blackout:0 "Media Blackout"
 TEX_media_blackout_desc:0 "A myriad of false and damaging narratives have been allowed to swirl in the public consciousness ever since the St. Patrick's Day attack. The time has come to shut down the stations and reporters peddling these false narratives, and establish strict control over broadcasting within Texas."
 TEX_martial_law:0 "Martial Law"
 TEX_martial_law_desc:0 "While our nation has been in a State of Emergency ever since the harrowing events of 2009, the most recent terrorist attack has proven that a mere state of emergency is not enough. Martial law shall be formally imposed, and President Perry given sweeping powers to deal with the vile scum who continue to terrorize Texas."
 TEX_inward_preperation:0 "Inward Preparation"
 TEX_inward_preperation_desc:0 "It has become increasingly clear that Texas will soon face a battle for its very survival. The false Republic continues their doomed crusade to resurrect a dead nation, and sees Texas as their first target. Dreams of revanchism and reclamation must be put on hold to focus on Texas' very survival. "
 TEX_early_warning_systems:0 "Early Warning Systems"
 TEX_early_warning_systems_desc:0 "Thanks to our position in the heart of Tornado Alley, Texas already has a formidable system of alerts and sirens in place which can warn the populace in the event of danger. As full-scale war with the Republic becomes more of a possibility, a program to retrofit these sirens for military threats has begun."
 TEX_survival_ethos:0 "Survivalist Ethos"
 TEX_survival_ethos_desc:0 "While Texans have always thought of themselves as a strong and self-reliant people, the possibility of essential services being cut off in the event of war means that this spirit of survivalism must be put to the test. The Department of Public Safety has officially recommended that all citizens prepare a to-go bag, and keep a one month supply of food and water ready at all times."
 TEX_outward_readiness:0 "Outward Readiness"
 TEX_outward_readiness_desc:0 "War is coming to our Lone Star state - this is a fact that cannot be denied. However where the Republic expects us to simply roll over and accept Republican domination, the fact is that they have sorely misunderestimated the will and fortitude of the Texan people. Come hell or high water, the Lone Star Republic shall endure."
 TEX_rattle_the_sabre:0 "Rattle the Sabre"
 TEX_rattle_the_sabre_desc:0 "For the better part of 10 years the Atlanta Government has been attempting to intimidate Texas with military force. These displays, no matter how grandiose, have failed to phase the Texan people, and have done nothing but strengthen the resolve of our proud people. As war seems inevitable, instead of cower in fear over the Republic's intimidation, we Texans shall make some power moves of our own..."
 TEX_armed_conflict_preparedness:0 "Armed Conflict Preparedness"
 TEX_armed_conflict_preparedness_desc:0 "Ever since the Dallas Fort-Worth area was first occupied by the Bush regime, our populace has lied in wait for their next major attack. This state of tension with the Republic has led to massive investments in war readiness programs and personal security by the Perry Government. With war seemingly on the horizon once more, the President has authorized even more investment in the sector so that our citizens will be protected once war finally arrives."
 TEX_a_match_made_in_hell:0 "Public Enemy Number One"
 TEX_a_match_made_in_hell_desc:0 "Wade Michael Page, leader of the far-right 'Hammerskin' group and the terrorist mastermind behind the devastating St. Patrick Day's attack, has become the Texas Rangers' most wanted man. A nationwide manhunt is underway for Page and his accomplices as Texan citizens demand justice for those wounded or slain in one of Texas' deadliest days."
 TEX_control_the_narrative:0 "Regain Control of the Narrative"
 TEX_control_the_narrative_desc:0 "The Scarlet Dossier revealed a truly stunning amount of incompetence by the Perry Government in the leadup to the I-37 attacks. This pattern of incompetence has led some to believe that Perry deliberately ignored warning signs so he could use the attack as an excuse to further justify his own power. While this narrative is undeniably false, the prevalence of such rumors remains deeply damaging to our government."
 TEX_tighten_the_border:0 "Tighten the Border"
 TEX_tighten_the_border_desc:0 "It is believed that many of the weapons used in the I-37 attack were smuggled across our border with the American Republic and Mexico. While border crossings to and from Mexico and the AR are already tight, this recent lapse in security has suggested that they need to be even more closely guarded."
 TEX_accuse_the_republic:0 "Accuse the Republic"
 TEX_accuse_the_republic_desc:0 "While the Republic has officially denounced the Hammerskin movement and their culpability with the San Antonio attacks, most people simply don't buy their lack of involvement. The time has come to make the Republic's involvement with these heinous attacks known to not just the public, but the world, and reveal to all the true barbarity of the Atlanta regime."
 TEX_and_we_shall_reclaim_dallas:0 "And We Shall Reclaim Dallas!"
 TEX_and_we_shall_reclaim_dallas_desc:0 "As the specter of war looms heavy, a new sense of passion has arisen within Texans. Contrasted with the hopeless defeatism of the past, much of our populace now cries out for revenge, and to reclaim what has been stolen from the Lone Star State. As the Republic readies itself for war, the resolve of our populace has proven beyond a doubt that it is a war that the Republic shall lose."
 TEX_impossible_odds:0 "A Legacy of Impossible Odds"
 TEX_impossible_odds_desc:0 "Goliad. Gonzales. San Jacinto. Throughout the Texan Revolution our brave soldiers faced the might of a behemoth and came out victorious. As we secured our independence from the Mexican Giant in 1836, more than 100 years later we shall secure our freedom from the forces of the American Republic. While some say our odds may be slim, Texans have never been known to let impossible odds stand in their way before. "
 
 TEX_eve_of_war:0 "The Eve of War"
 TEX_eve_of_war_desc:0 "As it seems, war with our neighbors to the East has become quite inevitable. As we prepare for what very well may be our nation's final battle, we look towards the wisdom of our forefathers, of Houston, of Austin, and of Davy Crockett, as well as our modern experts, for a strategy which may help Texas survive."
 TEX_fortress_austin:0 "Fortress Austin"
 TEX_fortress_austin_desc:0 "As the Capital City of the Texan Republic, securing Austin is of vital importance. Barricades, rodblocks, pillboxes and machine gun nests shall all be constructed post haste, as we endeavor to fortify the city against the incoming Republican advance. Hopefully, we can manage to do so in the time we have left."
 TEX_fortress_houston:0 "Fortress Houston"
 TEX_fortress_houston_desc:0 "As time runs out, we must take inventory of our nation's vital assets. Among the most important is the city of Houston, a bustling metroplex home to our nation's largest port. Right on the Republic's border, keeping control of this vital conurbation is of essential importance for our government. A sprawling, albeit makeshift defensive network shall be constructed with a small army of civilian volunteers and army engineers."
 TEX_molotov_cocktails:0 "Petrol Bombs"
 TEX_molotov_cocktails_desc:0 "Texans have a certain love for liquor, ranging from beer and whiskey to more contemporary poisons such as tequila. With war looming, many of our citizens have repurposed their empties from recycling bin liners into Molotov Cocktails. Makeshift weaponry has flooded the streets as angry citizens prepare to face down the Remnant occupiers for the first time since 1992. Additionally, new technology has even improved this time-honored classic, as the addition of styrofoam in the cocktail has made the once bland Petrol Bomb into an easy-to-make substitute for napalm."
 TEX_call_up_reserve:0 "Call Up the Reserves"
 TEX_call_up_reserve_desc:0 "Among our armed forces are countless reserve officers ready to be called up to serve their Republic in a time of crisis. As it seems, that time of crisis is now. The time has come for these soldiers to take their posts in defense of Texas, in hope that we may fend off the American invasion."
 TEX_leader_of_free_world:0 "The Free World's Leader"
 TEX_leader_of_free_world_desc:0 "The Canadians, along with the remains of the free world which didn't turn to Communism coalesced around the so-called 'Democratic League', the last major force in this world which continues the fight against Communism. While they have expressed favorability to the Republic's claims in the past, perhaps Ottawa can be swayed to support Texas' fight for freedom."
 TEX_enemy_of_my_enemy:0 "The Enemy of my Enemy"
 TEX_enemy_of_my_enemy_desc:0 "While the Perry Administration has held little love for Communists, the Soviet Union has proven itself surprisingly receptive of Texas' cause given their opposition to the GOP administration in Atlanta. Perhaps we could leverage their diplomatic pressure into tangible military aid for our Republic?"
 TEX_old_adversary:0 "Our Old Adversary"
 TEX_old_adversary_desc:0 "To say that Mexico and Texas have a rocky relationship can be best described as an understatement. That being said, both the Mexican Government and our nation's large Hispanic community seem to prefer Texan rule over Remnant rule. While it is clear that any support they provide would be in hopes of a weaker nation across their border to harrass or even conquer, it is also clear that our nation needs any help it can get. "
 TEX_foreign_voluneteers:0 "The Foreign Legions"
 TEX_foreign_voluneteers_desc:0 "From across the world, soldiers believing in our cause have come trickling in, offering up their services in the hope that Texas may remain free. From Communists, to anti-Atlanta militants, to soldiers from the other American breakaways hoping to weaken the Remnants, countless experienced warriors have volunteered their lives to our Republic, fighting alongside our own soldiers under the banner of the Lone Star."
 TEX_seize_civilian_weaponry:0 "Repurpose Civilian Guns"
 TEX_seize_civilian_weaponry_desc:0 "Texans are known for their love of all things firearms. While we remain staunchly supportive of our citizens' rights to bear arms, the present crisis has meant that the confiscation of certain firearms from civilians has become necessary. Hopefully we can return their rifles once this dreadful war comes to an end. "
 TEX_sam_houstons_struggle:0 "The Struggle of Sam Houston"
 TEX_sam_houstons_struggle_desc:0 "As it seems, the forces in Atlanta have shed their American claims, instead raising the banner of the fallen Confederate States of America. As we fight off the Confederate advance, we remember Sam Houston, and how fought unsuccessfully to prevent Texas from joining the Confederate States of America. History has vindicated Sam's actions, and now we shall right the wrongs wrought by our forefathers, banishing the Stars and Bars from Texas forever."
 TEX_south_wont_fall_again:0 "The South Won't Fall Again!"
 TEX_south_wont_fall_again_desc:0 "While the American Republic may be based in the heart of Dixie, make no mistake, it is a nation comprised of nothing more than Yankees and Carpetbaggers. With the remnants of the old Union looking to extinguish the flame of Dixie patriotism forever, we shall remember the struggles of our forefathers, and vow to defend Texas from American absorption so long as our banner still stands. "
 TEX_canadian_technology:0 "Utilize Canadian Technology"
 TEX_canadian_technology_desc:0 "It has come as a surprise to some that the Canadians have agreed to support our cause, going so far as to supply the Texan Military with some of their fabulously advanced military technology. This new 'Lend Lease' has provided Texas with some of the hottest new military equipment the market has to offer, supplying our disparate military in exchange for permanently staking ourselves to the Canadian cause."
 TEX_canadian_jets:0 "The Fastest Jets"
 TEX_canadian_jets_desc:0 "The battlefield of today is fought in the air, and while we may have a few talented pilots, it is rapidly becoming clear that we can't compete with the Republic's air force. With this in mind, our Canadian benefactors, as well as Aviation giants such as Boeing, Airbus and Bombardier, have pulled together to keep the Texan Air Force supplied with the latest in airborne tech."
 TEX_intranet_links:0 "Intranet Links"
 TEX_intranet_links_desc:0 "The Canadians, as one of the few nations with a fully-developed Intranet, have learned well the advantages unified networks can have for military command. As a primary supporter of our cause, the Canadian Government has authorized funding for Intranet and network expansions across the Republic. This will help our military remain cohesive, and give us an advantage over the Republic's ad-hoc communication systems."
 TEX_canadian_tanks:0 "Roll Out the Tanks"
 TEX_canadian_tanks_desc:0 "Much to our delight, the Canadian Government has agreed to supply the Texan Military with state-of-the-art armour, allowing our outdated and primarily infantry based army to break into the modern age. With the introduction of Canadian armour technology, hopefully the battlefield between Texan and Remnant troops will be a bit more even."
 TEX_american_proxy_war:0 "The American Proxy War"
 TEX_american_proxy_war_desc:0 "With the Canadians coming to the Remnant's side during this awful war, it seems that Texas has unwittingly become the newst battleground in the New Cold War. Thus, the Soviets have come to our aid in their own attempt to stop the Democratic League from gaining any ground in this new conflict. While their reasons for supporting our cause are mainly pragmatic, so are our reasons for accepting it."
 TEX_diplomatic_pressure:0 "Diplomatic Pressure"
 TEX_diplomatic_pressure_desc:0 "As the first major war on American soil in almost 20 years, the Republican/Texan war has attracted quite a bit of attention. The Soviet-dominated world has been quick to denounce the Republic's moves to re-unify the United States, and has sicced the United Nations to condemn Atlanta in turn. As well, Warsaw Pact nations have announced significant sanctions on the American Republic to further isolate them internationally."
 TEX_soviet_guns:0 "Soviet Weaponry"
 TEX_soviet_guns_desc:0 "The Soviet Union, while undeniably not on the best terms with the One Republic government, has still provided us with invaluable equipment in our fight against the Republic. Of course considering the Soviet Union's economic and political stagnation, the weaponry they provide is not as technologically advanced as ones supplied by Canada, if they can kill an American invader, they're good enough for us."
 TEX_unlikely_allies:0 "Unlikely Allies?"
 TEX_unlikely_allies_desc:0 "The Soviet Union and Texas have forged quite the strange alliance in recent months. While we remain diametrically opposed to their Communistic ideology, Texas has grown close to the various nations of the Warsaw Pact as they help us in our efforts to repel Republican attacks. As of now it seems that this is just an alliance of convenience... but who knows what the future holds."
 TEX_counter_attack:0 "The Counter-Attack"
 TEX_counter_attack_desc:0 "While we have been cowering in our foxholes ever since the Republic invaded, we believe our army is now in a state where it can begin counteroffensive operations. The time has come to show the Americans our full fury, as we slowly yet surely take back control of our territory."
 TEX_propaganda_effort:0 "Propaganda Effort"
 TEX_propaganda_effort_desc:0 "The emergence of the online web has led to a truly astounding amount of competing narratives, some more true than others. We can utilize our newfound connection to the Intranet to disseminate stories and information damaging to the Republican cause. Of course not all of the stories put out may be true, but in such a dire crisis, will anybody care about a few embellishments?"
 TEX_hispanic_recruitment:0 "Hispanic Recruitment Drive"
 TEX_hispanic_recruitment_desc:0 "Texas' Hispanic community has shown its reluctance to support our war efforts against the Republic. A near-constant slough of harassment from both civilians and law enforcements has left much of our Latino community with a profound lack of Texan patriotism. However with both their very lives under threat, and with an unofficial go-ahead from the 'Mother Country', Hispanic citizens have begun enlisting in droves to help the Texan cause."

Those who can't stand to see their brothers, cousins, neighbors and friends in Texas on the wrong end of the bayonet have taken to the streets to voice their disapproval to President [USA.GetLeader]. Of course, small acts of sabotage will go a long way when they refuse to listen..."

Who better to lead the Texan delegation than the son of the 'Great Leader' himself, George Walker Bush. This failed Presidential candidate turned Baseball Manager has come to think of himself as a true Texan, and will plead with [USA.GetLeader] to end this rotten conflict for the good of all Americans and once-Americans. Hopefully they will listen... After all, who could say no to a Bush?"

Tragically, it seems that not even the power of family could end this war. If pleas of John Ellis Bush's own brother were not enough to sway his opinion on the war, then it truly seems that nothing will. As George Walker Bush returns to Houston, it has become clear to all that the son of George H.W. Bush himself has chosen his nation over his very family... A noble sacrifice indeed."

Embittered just like his brother after failing to secure the nomination in 2002, some have suggested that George W. reach out to his brother about the possibility of defecting to Texas.

One Republic is more than just some run-of-the-mill political party, it is a vast lifeform which has come to dominate every facet of Texan life.

The Legal System has been turned into Perry's greatest weapon, serving as both a scalpel and a hammer against any and all opposition to One Republic rule.

Seeking to rule in a non-partisan capacity, President North has opted to separate the Presidency from the political squabbles that dominate Congress.

As part of her agenda, Davis shall seek to formally legalize Abortion in certain cases across Texas.

 texas.3.t:0 "The Lone Star Republic"
 texas.3.d:0 "Texas. The Lone Star State. One of the few nations born out of the USA's collapse which can boast about a history of independent Government, many assumed that Texas would rise to be one of the undisputed great powers of the former United States. Tragically, the opposite has come to be, as the modern 'Second Republic of Texas' has been faced with almost two decades of terrible luck. From the Mexican border wars to the Remnant invasion, it seems that Texas has not been spared from the chaos which has enveloped much of the rest of the country. However from this humiliation rises a desire for revenge; for reconquest, and for a restoration of Texan pride and prowess not just in our home but across America. The odds of such a thing happening remain slim, however we in Texas aren't one to shy away from long odds. From Goliad to Gonzales, and even the Alamo, we Texans shall not shy away from our destiny... no matter how hopelessly outgunned we may be.\n\nSuch is the theme of President Rick Perry's newest term in office, as the rhetoric surrounding relations with our neighbors has increasingly turned towards revanchism, the reclaimation of our Lost Territories, and even the restoration of 'Greater Texas' borders of 1848. While it can not conclusively be said that Texas is bracing itself for war, such a scenario is definitely on the Perry Administration's mind."
 texas.3.o1:0 "God Bless you Texas, and keep you Brave and Strong."
 
 texas.4.t:0 "Our Wilted Rose"
 texas.4.d:0 "Texas' borders were among the most iconic of any state in the pre-collapse United States, with the iconic shape of the State of Texas adjourning every truck stop, BBQ joint and souvenir shop from Amarillo to Laredo. When Texas first left the Union, it was hoped that these borders would be preserved, or even expanded. Indeed, after the annexation of the State of New Mexico in 1993, it seemed that Mirabeau B. Lamar's dream of a Texas stretching from the Gulf to the Pacific was well on its way to being fulfilled. However as things often do, eventually everything eventually went terribly wrong. Race Riots caused by increasing hostilities between Anglo-Texans and the large Mexican-American minority in Southern Texas and New Mexico caused an 'intervention' by our neighbors to the South. The Mexicans, while bogged down by an almost decade long battle with powerful Drug Cartels, still proved to be a formidable force, and managed to walk away with the left bank of the Rio Grande and much of Southern Texas, including major cities such as Laredo and Corpus Christi. This event has led to the Texan government having a perpetual chip on their shoulder towards the large Hispanic Community in Texas; fueling race-based tensions and driving many formerly 'loyal' citizens into the arms of the Mexican Government. The sense of Texan nationalism born out of this incident has taken a notably different tone to that expressed towards the Republic, as Anti-Mexican hostilities have frequently boiled over into lynch mobs, race riots and anti-Hispanic witch hunts. As inequality continues to run deep in Texas, many have predicted that tensions between our Hispanic communities may soon reach a boiling point."

 texas.5.t:0 "Blood on the Astrodome"
 texas.5.d:0 "Today was meant to be a day for great celebration for the people of Texas, as our flagship baseball team, the Texas Rangers managed to score a knockout victory against the New York Yankees in this year's American League Championship Series. Game 6, held at Houston's Astrodome, the home of the Texas Rangers ever since Arlington's takeover the the Republic, solidified the championship for the rangers, and was thus the location of a roaring post-game party commemorating Texas' win. However as team owner George W. Bush appeared to talk to the press, joy turned to horror as a gunman in the crowd fired wildly in his direction. Luckily, of the four shots fired by the gunman, two missed entirely, one mished Bush's army by an inch and the last one struck batter Josh Hamilton in the leg. It is believed that the gunman, who fled before they could be identified, targeted team owner George W. Bush due to his relation to former President George H.W. Bush. Indeed, Bush had once hoped to follow in his father's footsteps as President of the Republic; however following a bitter loss in the 2002 election, Bush swore off politics forever, moved away from the so-called 'Bush Cult' and took up residence in Texas, where he became the owner of the Texas Rangers baseball team. While typically silent on non-sporting matters, the few statements he has given since have been highly critical of the Rumsfeld administration, and especially their policies towards Texas. He has since come to identify exclusively as a Texan instead of an American, despite retaining dual citizenship.\n\nJosh Hamilton was quickly rushed to the nearby Texas Medical Center following the incident, where he is to make a full recovery and return as a batter next season. Both President Perry, team owner Bush, and Yankees manager Joe Girardi have condemned this awful attack, and have extended their best wishes to the injured."

 texas.6.t:0 "Ending the War on Broccoli?"
 texas.6.d:0 "Among the lesser-known but still notable qualities of former President Bush was his loathing of Broccoli. Bush frequently mentioned his distaste for broccoli, famously saying: 'I do not like broccoli. And I haven't liked it since I was a little kid. And my mother made me eat it. Now I'm president of the American Republic. And I'm not gonna eat any more broccoli!'. Dwarfed by his status as 'Savior of the South' during the Great American Collapse, this fact has permeated the public consciousness in recent years, as Broccoli emerges as a prominent symbol for those opposed to the Bush Cult. The spread of the Anti-Broccoli movement has reached such an extent that even consuming the vegetable is seen as an unpatriotic act. While many are hesitant to critique even the most menial characteristics of the late President due to his near-godlike status, many nutrition experts have cautioned that the public's apprehension of broccoli may be having a negative effect on the nation's health. And while challenging the late President's rebellion against broccoli may garner us bad press due to the public's admiration of him, from both a nutritional and culinary standpoint, ending the decades-long war against this vegetable may be worth the effort."

 texas.7.t:0 "Rumors of Major Attack Incoming"
 texas.7.d:0 "Among the Austin offices of the Texas Central Intelligence Service, rumors have stirred about the possibility of another major attack occurring. Chatter from terrorist cells have suggested that a major terrorist operation is underway, one which could possibly be worse than last year's May 29th attacks. While it is not yet known where they will target, or how they will go about with their operation, it is strongly suggested that San Antonio may be the source of the attack. Primary intel suggests that the terrorists may attempt to attack the Alamo, a major Texan cultural symbol, however other reports suggest that this latest attack may attempt to damage vital infrastructure such as waterways, power lines, and highways. While TCIS agents have presented their concerns to President Perry, Austin does not appear to be taking these dire warnings very seriously."

 texas.8.t:0 "Security Around the Alamo Increased"
 texas.8.d:0 "For the last few days, reports from the TCIS headquarters in Austin have suggested that a major terrorist attack near San Antonio is imminent. Primary intelligence reports have indicated that these terrorists intend to target vital infrastructure and transportation networks, however secondary reports also suggest that they intend to target the Alamo, a major Texan cultural center. The government has announced that instead of moving troops in to defend vital infrastructure, Texan security forces will be reassigned to the Alamo. This runs counter to many of the TCIS' suggestions, as several intelligence experts question the merits of sparing troops to defend the already heavily-guarded Alamo instead of defending our nation's most essential infrastructure. Additionally, new intelligence coming in has suggested that the terrorists have zeroed in on the I-37 as their target, and are already beginning preparations to attack. The Perry government has thus far ignored their calls to reassign troops to defend vital infrastructure."

 texas.9.t:0 "Terror on the I-37"
 texas.9.d:0 "The Citizens of San Antonio awoke to terror and mayhem today, as two tremendous explosions rocked the I-37 freeway, killing 237 people and injuring almost 100 more. Two trucks manned by members of the 'Hammerskin' Neo-Nazi terrorist organizations were parked on two ends of I-37 during the height of rush hour on St. Patrick's Day. These trucks were stuffed to the gills with high explosives, and collectively created a blast wave which spanned over two hundred feet in diameter, and instantly killed more than 100 people. After the two bombs were detonated, a large section of I-37 collapsed, killing almost 50 more. The death toll from this incident has dwarfed that of the May 29th attack, already remembered as one of the deadliest days in the history of our Republic. President Perry has addressed the nation to denounce the masterminds behind this plot, issue a call for justice, and attempt to comfort the people of Texas in one of their darkest hours..."

 texas.10.t:0 "Terrorist Mastermind Releases Manifesto"
 texas.10.d:0 "The airwaves have been abuzz today, as the manifesto of the mastermind of the devastating St. Patrick's Day attacks, Wade Michael Page, has been released. A former U.S. Army veteran, Page was discharged for drunk and disorderly conduct, eventually falling in with the White Supremacist music scene in Houston. With the identity of the terrorist being revealed as Page, it has become clear that the culpability behind the attack lies with the Hammerskin Neo-Nazi movement, which has greatly grown in strength after the destruction of the New Americans group, making them the number one anti-Republic terrorist group in Texas. While the Hammerskin movement officially has no leader, many have speculated that Page has served as a de-facto leader or guide for the movement throughout recent years. The manifesto released by Page was read over the airwaves under intense pressure after several TV and radio stations reported a series of direct threats of violence by White Supremacist groups. Contained within the document were several paragraphs of unhinged ranting, mostly targeting non-whites and religious minorities. While Page denounced both the Republic and the Texan Governments, the document has called for the creation of a unified White Supremacist state within the former United States, clearly linking Page to anti-Annexationist rhetoric."

 texas.11.t:0 "TCIS Agents Claim They Were Warned"
 texas.11.d:0 "As Texas reels from the aftermath of the St. Patricks Day attack, several anonymous agents of the Texan Central Security Service, our nation's primary intelligence agency, have claimed that they had shared knowlege of the attack in advance, yet had no action taken. While these claims are nothing more than rumour now, the general sense that experts were ignored has permeated much of our intelligence community. As this dissatisfaction becomes more prominent, experts have warned that those involved with the so-called 'coverup' may be inclined to speak out, and that if they do, it could have dire concequences for both Texan intelligence capibilities, and the Perry Government."
 texas.11.o1:0 "Keep them quiet."

 texas.12.t:0 "Dossier Released"
 texas.12.d:0 "The murmurs around the St. Patricks Day Attack have now grown into shouts, as a devestating dossier has been released by anonymous officials within the TCIS. This dossier claims that Texan inteligence agencies warned President Perry about an incoming attack on vital infrastructure, yet Perry took no action to stop this horrific loss of life, only offering to divert more security forces to the Alamo due to incorrect information that the monument would be the source of the attack. Furthermore, the dossier alleges that Perry the instructed TCIS agents to destroy evidence to the contrary, to paint a false narrative that the Alamo was indeed the intended target, and that the President took all nescecary precautions instead of ignoring prominent intelligence experts. While the TCIS has thus far contained the leak, many have begun to fear that they can't keep people quiet forever..."
 texas.12.o1:0 "Supress it at once."

 texas.14.t:0 "Anonymous Sources Contact Journalists"
 texas.14.d:0 "The Texas Central Intelligence Services, the Intelligence Agency of our Republic, has been strangely quiet ever since the horrific attack on San Antonio on St. Patrick's day. This silence is atypical considering the high-profile nature of the attack. Recently, accusations have floated that President Rick Perry ignored intelligence experts about the true nature of the San Antonio attack, and when confronted, destroyed evidence to the contrary, framing the President in a much better light. Allegedly, the truth is that the President ordered security forces to be posted to the already heavily guarded Alamo instead of the I-37, which was correctly speculated to be the target of the attack. With a coverup in full swing, several anonymous agents have contacted high-profile jouranalists with these allegations, hoping to bring the truth about what happened before March 17th."
 texas.14.o1:0 "Surely just hyperbole."

 texas.15.t:0 "'Scarlet Dossier' Releases"
 texas.15.d:0 "Alex Jones, reporter for a CTV affiliate in Austin, has broken the news with a truly shocking story. According to the veteran investigative reporter, President Rick Perry has covered up a truly stunning string of incompetence within the executive branch, and has incorrectly framed the Texan Intelligence Agency as being culpable for a number of missteps before the St. Patrick's Day Attacks. Jones, known for his work during the El Paso Riots, the Lubbock corruption scandal, and for his interviews with high-profile figures such as Bashar al-Assad, has most recently made headlines for his work to expose the TCIS coverup, and has used his investigative journalism experience to get the full report, dubbed by many as the 'Scarlet Dossier', released and publicized.\n\nIn the wake of such damning evidence, the Perry administration has gone into defense mode, labeling the report as untrue and attempting to sue the Canadian broadcasting company for libel. Nobody seems to buy the President's rebuttal, and already hundreds have taken to the streets to protest the President's role in the tragic loss of over 200 lives that fateful March day. Already some have begun to question whether this failure was truly incompetence, or if Perry was simply looking for an opportunity to extend his own authority..."

 texas.16.d:0 "Nearly a week after the tragic assassination attempt on the life of Texas Rangers owner George W. Bush, the team owner, has finally made an address about the tragic near-miss and injury of Rangers star batter Josh Hamilton. Reactions to the shooting have caused outrage across the American Republic, as outraged citizens demand a response for the attempted assassination on a member of the Bush family, even if George Jr. has retired from politics and stayed safely outside of the Bush cult ever since his bitter loss in the 2002 primaries. Some had expected Bush to call for Remnant military intervention in the wake of his assassinationattempt, and announce a triumphant return home to Atlanta on the heels of a successful intervention in Texas. Instead, Bush' spent the entirety of his speech talking about mundane matters relating to baseball. Strategically ignoring almost every question fielded to him relating to the political realities of the Bush family, the team owner instead spoke at length about the team's future after the tragic shooting of their MVP batter, which no doubt was meant to target Bush himself. While he has extended repeated good wishes to Hamilton, he has refused to elaborate on his fate within the team, and has not stated definitely whether his recent injury will be a career-ending one. While Bush cultists have been caught in a disappointed silence, the outcome of the press conference has starkly divided fans of baseball."

 texas.17.t:0 "Jones Speaks Out"
 texas.17.d:0 "Ever since the story of the Perry Government's fatal incompetence in regards to the March 17th attacks broke, a string of conflicting narratives have been spun by both Government Agencies, News Networks and so-called 'independent thinkers'. This has tragically had the effect of sowing doubt about every detail of the I-37 attack, with many being so brazen as to doubt the attack entirely, claiming it to be a False Flag or even denying that it occurred entirely. This narrative is particularly prevalent among Anti-secessionist communities, who have engaged in a steady harrasment campaign against those injured in the attack. Alex Jones, the reporter behind the Scarlet Dossier story, has taken to the airwaves to denounce the harassment against victims of these attacks, going on the record to state that he in no way intended to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the attacks, and revealed Perry's coverup in an attempt to ensure that such horrific events may never repeat. These words have made him a sworn enemy of rabid groups of conspiracy theorists who have intensified their campaign against attack victims figures opposed to Texan annexation. Jones, who was one of the first reporters on the scene of the I-37 attack, has responded to this escalating harassment campaign by founding the 'Citizens for Recovery and Healing', a charitable group dedicated to aiding those injured pro-Remnant terrorist attacks, and providing consolation to those who have lost friends and relatives in these barbaric attacks. While a certain subset of the populace remains convinced beyond reason that these people are nothing more than 'Crisis Actors', Jones remains committed to restoring the public’s faith in the truth, and helping those affected in any way he can."

 texas.18.t:0 "Perry Initiates Media Crackdown"
 texas.18.d:0 "In the light of a growing conspiracy culture surrounding the March 17th attack, President Rick Perry has made a truly shocking decision to shut down countless independent news agencies and radio stations across the Republic of Texas. This so-called 'Media Consolidation Act' aims to centralize broadcasting in Texas around easily controllable venues, and seeks to shut down 'dangerous' narratives surrounding the tragic loss of life in San Antonio. This act, while noble in a sense, has been criticized by many as an attack on free speech within Texas, and is evidence to many that the Perry Government is becoming increasingly authoritarian. Perry has responded to these claims by stating that the government was not hindering citizens' rights to speak their mind, but rather on the ability for unregistered broadcasters to amplify false narratives. This response has not swayed many, as many figures in the media, even those diametrically opposed to the conspiracy theorists claiming March 17th was a False Flag such as Alex Jones, have denounced these new laws as an attack on free speech, pointing to the fact that many left-wing and anti-Perry stations were also shutdown as a result of the act. Additionally, there are doubts that this will actually combat the issue of March 17th Denialism; some even predict that this act may amplify it."

 texas.19.t:0 "Martial Law in Effect"
 texas.19.d:0 "While a State of Emergency has been in effect ever since the 2009 attacks, Perry's authority has still been reigned in by a series of checks and balances. However following the devastating San Antonio attack, Congress has almost unilaterally approved the imposition of Martial Law across the Republic. Restrictions surrounding the military and police have been removed, and strict media controls have been formalized. While many Democrat and Independent Republican members of Congress have voted with Perry to authorize the bill, several opposition figures have criticized the measures as being needlessly authoritarian, and have even gone so far to say that Perry now has dictatorial power.\n\n The direct imposition of Martial law is seen by many as yet another escalation in the spat between Texas and the Republic, and has many citizens of our great Republic fearing that war with our neighbors to the east may be on the horizon..."

 texas.20.d:0 "Citizens of our Republic today awoke to news that Wade Michael Page, the mastermind behind the San Antonio attack, has been located and killed. After so many tragedies, news that the instigator behind the March 17th attack has finally been brought to justice is a rare piece of good news for our people, especially those who lost family and friends in the San Antonio attack. Page was tracked down in part due to a tip-off from local residents, who recognized the terrorist from the mugshot plastered all over local media. Held up in a dingy motel outside Odessa Texas, Page had attempted to lay low, only leaving in the cover of night to secure additional supplies and ammunition. It is reported that the motel manager recognized Page's distinctive bald head and glasses despite his attempts to conceal these distinctive features with a hoodie, and almost immediately informed the Police; mainly in an attempt to collect the reward on Page's head. While Page initially tried to flee once he discovered his location had been compromised, he was apparently too late, as almost 60 Texas Rangers descended on his hideout before he could go on the run. While a brief shootout ensued, it soon became clear that Page had been killed, either by a self-inflicted gunshot suicide or by a stray bullet striking him in the left temple. With Page dead, the citizens of Texas can finally breathe a sigh of relief knowing that the architect behind the horrible March 17th attack has finally met his maker."

The most damning evidence being the fact that they released their condolences for victims of the attack... 14 minutes before it actually occurred. The fact that Atlanta's intelligence agencies knew about this attack beforehand and chose not to inform us is not a matter of debate, however their intentions and ideological connections to the known 'Hammerskin' terrorist organization is still up for debate. The Hammerskins, which rose in prominence after the destruction of the New Americans, are not a group motivated solely by loyalty to Atlanta. Rather they are a neo-Nazi movement seemingly opposed to both of our governments. However, as the primary anti-Secession movement, it would appear logical that they would be targets of Atlanta's support. While [USA.GetLeader] has fervently denied these claims, even if they have no ideological alignment, they clearly had no qualms with letting this group wreak havoc in an attempt to damage our infrastructure and weaken our nation's national cohesion."

The general sense among our citizenry is one of foreboding. To Texans, it has become clear that March 17th was merely an introduction to a wider threat, a threat that will not rest until our Republic is destroyed. Something is going to happen, we don't know where, we don't know when, but its going to happen. The Hammerskins and the New Americans may be gone, but there still remains no shortage of radical elements willing to resort to violence in an attempt to  force their ideology. And while our Police and Armed Forces may remain ever vigilant, the growing consensus is that our capabilities are still not enough. Whatever may end up happening could very well allow our neighbors to the East to smell weakness, impeling them to finish their decades-long struggle to erase Texas once and for all. While we hope for the best, the next months could go so far as to spell doom for the Texan nation if not handled properly."

A recent Gallup Poll has revealed that 57% of Texans characterize his handling of the Terrorist situation as 'very poor', with a further 62% believing that Perry would not be the best person to lead Texas into a potential military confrontation with the American Republic. Furthermore, a total of 71% either disapprove or 'strongly disapprove' of the recent imposition of Martial Law, with almost 44% of respondents saying that Perry's invocation of Martial Law was more about political gain than keeping Texans safe. Perry has responded to these criticisms by either assuring Texans that Martial Law is temporary until the situation stabilizes, or accusing dissenters of siding with Republican terrorists. Despite this evidence of overwhelming opposition, Perry appears to show no signs of changing course, with some predicting he may even strengthen Martial Law as war with the Republic looms."

As the days since the March 17th attack tick by, and as reports of Terroristic actions dwindle, Perry's justifications are appearing to be more and more flimsy. However tension still looms, and among our Military and Intelligence Agencies, all are convinced that our Republic's troubles are far from over. However to these ends, Perry's policies seem to be working in the opposite direction. The renewed crackdown is driving moderates from his camp, and is making the crucial matter of governing much more difficult. As well, those who oppose Perry have been becoming more militant, potentially leading to a series of escalations from both left-wing and right-wing elements. As for Perry, he seems to show no sign of letting up, as an extensive police and military response is planned for protests against his continued rule."

As expected, these protests quickly turned ugly, as Police turned water cannons and rubber bullets on those who took to the streets to demand an end to Martial Law. Further complicating things, protesters who demanded 'Reconciliation' with the American Republic came into heated conflict with anti-Perry activists, many of whom still identify as Texan patriots and oppose the American Republic. While the police have been quick to dispatch these groups, the supposed 'solidarity' between pro-Remnant groups and those who oppose Martial Law is seemingly a godsend to Perry in the narrative department. Unfortunately, it seems that such a fact is not enough to diffuse public anger surrounding Perry's policies..."

As new pictures of water cannons and rubber bullet wounds circulate, more citizens are driven to the streets to express their discontent with continued Martial Law. Soon enough, these once 'peaceful' protests turned to riots, as downtown Austin became engulfed in flames. Looting sprees and vandalism have become commonplace as the police struggle to deal with the growing crowds. Perry has denounced these riots to the strongest degree, accusing protesters of siding with the American Republic and working to undermine Texas. Furthermore, Perry has promised to deploy army units around the capital to keep order, even going so far as to authorize the use of deadly force should the need arise. Of course, Perry has also urged 'extreme caution' in such matters.\n\nWhile Perry has been given a narrative win today, the large scale of the protests has also gone to show that Perry's grip on power may not be as secure as once thought, and that Texan's support of the One Republic may not be as widespread as it was before."

In such a dire situation, having a capable second-in-command is vital, and thus it has been recommended that Perry fill this vacancy post haste. The obvious candidate for Dewhurst's replacement is talented Military Officer and Politician Oliver North. North has served with distinction during the Mexican War and the Remnant Incursion. The presence of a Military Man in such a prominent cabinet role is a signal to many that war is indeed on the horizon, and that Perry has tapped the expertise of such a seasoned National Security advisor in an attempt to formulate a strategy to defend Texas against our eastern neighbors. While high-ranking officials have dismissed claims that North's selection was an admission of the inevitability of war, North's inclusion has undoubtedly sent a strong message about the path that lies forward for Texas..."

Additionally, Bolton has declared that Texas is rightfully American territory, and has signed an open letter to President Perry demanding he relinquish his office and return Texas to American sovereignty. Henry Kissinger however has indicated support for an option which would allow Texas to remain independent, albeit on Remnant terms.

The Republic is dead set on an invasion, and would most likely be less than amicable to Perry once they inevitably capture Austin. As it seems, the best option on Perry's hands is to simply leave. Flee to a friendly country and pray that CIA agents won't track him down.

Still, Secretary Kissinger still has the ear of the President, and is suggesting that we cut a deal with Perry and officially recognize the existence of the Second Republic of Texas so long as they agree to become an American satellite state.

While some have already conceded to our defeat, and wish to surrender only to spare Texans citizenry from a destructive war, others have echoed the words of those brave defenders of the Alamo.

According to Atlanta they are merely retaking 'Rightful American territory', stating that Texas is an illegitimate state with no distinct identity, and rightfully American. Of course, the response by Texan citizens seems to prove otherwise. As the leader of the 'Free World', Canada is a natural target for support by governments seeking to maintain the cause of freedom. While naturally supporting the Texans in their endeavor would be a no-brainer, the fact remains that Atlanta is the American Claimant on the friendliest terms with the Democratic League, and is at least in theory the only one which maintains some form of Democracy.

Both those who wish for peace and those who wish to reclaim the Mexican Cession have raised their concerns about a potential Texan conquest by the Remnant Government, as a weaker Texas would be easier to influence than a more powerful American Republic.

Whether this will lead to a cooling in relations between Texas and Mexico is anybody's guess; however their show of support in our nation's darkest hour certainly suggests as much.

The theology followed by these Branch Davidians was first theorized by Seventh-day Adventist Victor Houteff, who founded his own group known as 'Davidians'. Houteff and his Davidian Church would found a community in Waco Texas known as the Mount Carmel. Ownership of this compound would transfer to Houteff's wife after his death, however after an apocalyptic prophecy failed to come true, Florence sold the land to Benjamin Roden who developed the group's theology further. Eventually, Koresh would join the group and amass a small following, eventually taking control of the compound after a small shootout. Ever since, Koresh and his group has steadily grown in power, amassing an impressive cache of weaponry and absorbing several competing groups. Since the start of the war, Koresh has sent his followers into action, engaging them in small skirmishes with Republican troops and planning acts of sabatoge. While some remain weary of Koresh's intentions and views, it cannot be denied that his group has provided valuable support to our nation's military in a time of crisis. "

Jones came to call Texas home along with the other 'Calixiles' who relocated after their expulsion from the UAPR, mainly other moderate socialist and religious groups who protested against the UAPR's authoritarianism and State Atheism. While One Republic maintains its suspicions of this group, Rev. Jones has provided uncritical support to the cause of Texas independence in this time of crisis, rallying his followers against the 'Godless Reactionaries' in Atlanta. Jones has petitioned the President to allow for the creation of a 'People's Temple' military brigade, stating in a letter 'Love is the only weapon with which I've got to fight? I've got a hell of a lot of weapons to fight! I've got my claws. I've got cutlasses. I've got guns. I've got dynamite. I've got a hell of a lot to fight! I'll fight! I'll fight!'.

Now such an influx in Cult recruitment would be only a minor problem, if not for the fact that both of these groups are actively involved in our nation's war effort. A steady trickle of semi-legitimate military support and donated weaponry has allowed these groups to function as heavily-armed and organized militias, fanatically loyal to their so-called 'divinely ordained' leaders. Such a situation is seen by many as a disaster waiting to happen, as these groups could easily prove to be a nightmare to deal with if their 'Messiahs' turn on us.

Be them sympathetic warriors who have taken pity on us for our plight, or soldiers committed to the very end to the cause of Texan independence. Among the largest sources of these volunteers has been from the other post-American nations, who seek to delay or prevent the conquest of Texas in hopes that their own nations may be spared conquest by Remnant forces. While their experience levels may vary, the fact still remains that these foreign brigades have proven vital to the continued survival of the Texan military, helping out in vital tasks such as Reconnaissance and Special operations. Governments friendly to our cause have provided a tepid response to the departure of foreign volunteers, while those friendly to the Remnants have sought to prevent their citizens from enlisting. So far, the enlistment of so many from across the world has gone to show the Republic that the nations of the world support Texas' cause, and that countless are willing to put their very lifeblood on the line to protect this nation from Remnant conquest.

Understandably, the confiscation of civilian weaponry is an unpopular proposal for many, even if it is for the greater war effort. Of course, considering our dire situation, some have gone further to suggest the full-scale seizure of smaller arms such as handguns for use in the war with the Remnants. Additionally, weaponry would also be repurposed from local law enforcement under this proposal.

While this proposal does not satisfy the desires of the most hardent warmongers in Atlanta's, Bush's suggestions seem to be the start to an end to hostilities between our two nations - if only for a moment. Of course, the bulk of the pressure on Atlanta's end seems to be from the Texan war taking much longer than predicted, leading to a situation which [USA.GetLeader] can't easily back out of.

The former Florida Governor has officially declared his defection to the American Republic, and denounced [USA.GetLeader] for his actions towards the Texan people. While undoubtedly much of this comes from Jeb's bitterness over losing to [USA.GetLeader] in the 2010 Elections, it seems familial loyalty also played a part in his decision.

Dissidents have used the Texan 'Lone Star' as a symbol of dissent, affixing it to their clothing and featuring the symbol in anti-war graffiti. Local police have been quick to crack down on these subversives, hauling thousands of would-be activists away to detention centers for their treason against the American war effort. Despite our crackdown, the sentiment expressed by these rioters still remain embedded in our society, as anti-war Hippies and activists continue to sabotage the rightful cause of American reunification.

Unfortunately, it seems that this debate has had rather the opposite effect. From the get-go, Perry was hounded by Ron Paul, who lobbed criticism about the handling of the war towards Perry. Additionally, they criticized the President as being authoritarian for continuing Martial Law despite the Remnant war coming to an end some months prior. However the most embarrassing moment of all for Perry was when he stated his proposal for abolishing three government agencies, naming the Departments of Commerce and Education, but failing to remember the third. When pressed as to what the third department was, Perry admitted that he could not remember, adding 'Sorry. Oops.'.

Perry, whose reputation has been tarnished by his decision to flee on the eve of war, has been nowhere to be found, with neither TCIS or CIA agents having the foggiest idea where he fled to with his millions of dollars in looted government funds. Most have come to the conclusion that Perry is hiding out somewhere in South America, living the high life with almost a billion in stolen funds. As it stands, Perry enjoys a meager 7% approval rating, the lowest of any current or former Texan President. Publicly denouncing his predecessor's policies, North has promised to affirm a vision of Texan nationalism that stands to unite Texans rather than divide them. This new direction, in addition to a harsh crackdown on corruption, seeks to define North from his ill-fated predecessor."

 texas.85.d:0 "In the latest development in a series of spats between President North and One Republicites in Congress, President North has made the shocking decision to resign his One Republic membership and instead govern as an independent. Railing against the 'Weakness' of the Political Establishment, President North has announced the formal cessation of the One Republic Party as a political entity - even as many in Congress continue to govern under the One Republic banner. Indeed, the OR Caucus in Congress, reportedly not consulted about this decision, have been blindsided by North's actions, with most declaring that they do not intend to follow through with North's purported dissolution of the Party. Meanwhile North, who has often declared organized political parties to be a 'Hindrance', is rumoured to be moving forward with legislation which will prohibit all political parties from operating on a national level. Despite large amounts of discontent from the One Republic Caucus, due to North's tremendous popularity, few have openly spoken up to denounce the President, with only a few lodging meager complaints. As it appears, the era of One Republic, which started with Perry, is destined to end with Perry, as North moves to sever all ties with the old political establishment, instead floating off his own popularity to lead Texas forward instead of relying on individual parties. Many members of the One Republic are already bracing for the worst next election, as the Party now lacks a standard-bearer."

This move, which has its share of supporters and detractors within all major parties, seeks to cultivate Texan strength, preventing political bickering and instead focusing on a consensus-based model of governance which shall help all Texans feel represented without special interests and Party Politics mucking things up. Parties such as One Republic, the Democrats, and Independent Republicans continue to operate on a local level - however as it appears, Party Politics on the national level are dead. North has assembled his 'Freedom Coalition' in Congress, consisting of One Republicites, Democrats, and Independent Republicans who now sit as independents. While opposition movements still exist in the Texan legislature, they exist as Independent politicians not affiliated with any party, united instead by their common goals instead of any particular ideology. With Texan politics now free of Political Parties, President North can move forward with an agenda that truly represents Texans, focusing his efforts on keeping Texas safe instead of dealing with an increasingly belligerent Congress. Despite some controversy, this move still has widespread political support among Texans."

We cannot simply lie back and allow our citizenry to fall victim to the savagery of war. With this in mind, President North has ordered a comprehensive review of all Emergency Alert Systems within the Republic of Texas, introducing a coloured system that seeks to inform the people about the severity and nature of any crisis that may sneak up on them. Separate warning systems have been rolled into one, comprehensive EAS system that can warn people of Tornadoes, Floods, Terrorist Attacks, Remnant Aggression, High Taxes, Subversive Thought, and Otherworldly Abominations, in the off chance that they appear. The different levels of these alert systems trigger special actions from responsible agencies, depending on the exact nature and severity of whatever may be occurring. While the layout of the system has been denounced by many as overly confusing, the simple colour-coded system remains the best defense Texans have against chaos and uncertainty. From Code Red, to Code Yellow, to Code Blackwatch Plaid, all Texans shall know these new designations by heart, and be prepared to take the appropriate action should the alert be raised."

Only thanks to the smart leadership of Oliver North was tragedy avoided. While one can point to countless reasons as to why Texas was unprepared, President North has identified an unconventional factor in the sorry state of the Perry Administration's war preparations. The One Republic Party under Perry was already focused on fighting a war in 2010 - not a war against the Remnanants, but rather a war against the Texan people. The actual war against Atlanta was ignored in favour of a Culture War, as Perry sought to demonize or otherwise harass Texans who didn't fit into One Republic's increasingly-narrow viewpoint. From Homosexuals to non-Christian, it seems like the Republic's disdain for certain Texans was second only to Perry's. During the war, Homosexuals, Atheists and Muslims fought with distinction against the forces of Atlanta, even as Perry sought to restrict enlistment to openly Gay soldiers pre-war. North, in a policy widely credited for helping to fill Texas' suffering ranks, undid this policy, declaring that so long as you can carry a rifle, the Government could give a damn about what you do in the bedroom, officially legalizing Homosexuality in a collaboration with Democrats in Congress. North, while far from a paragon of Social Liberalism, seems to realize that fighting a Culture War is pointless so long as an actual war remains looming over the horizon."

However the rest of the budget, the remainder of the pie chart going to various agencies you shouldn't worry yourself with, has been a matter of contention within the halls of Congress. Education has long been ignored by previous One Republic administrations, with it being an open secret that Perry and his ilk wished to funnel public school funding into Private Institutions. North, however, believes that all Texans ought to receive a proper education - an education which can teach basic survival skills and the skills needed to thrive in military life. With the Perry Administration's corruption finally being undone, the flow of public funds has once more been safeguarded, as Budget Watchdogs bring the hammer down on the Corruption which has long plagued the Republic of Texas. As we work to instill the values of Texan life into the minds of our youth, a new focus on Patriotism has started, as public institutions teach the facts about Texan history - from Goliad to the Alamo, and to the East Texas War to the Remnant, we shall remodel the Public Education system into a formidable force that ensures all Texans, regardless of income or class, grow up as patriotic sons of the Alamo, and receive a proper schooling that allows them to prosper both in civilian and military life."

Everyone knows we’re not going to get any action or inspiration from career politicians. They’re so busy holding on to power they never take the time to send the elevator back down. But mabye, just mabye, Friedman is the man to break the cycle, and run those keeping Texas down off on a rail. He's not a politician, folks. Hell, Friedman hasn't even been indicted yet. The President sixty-two years old. That’s too young for Medicare and too old for women to care. But the President cares about Texas.

After all that money was spent, less than 30 percent of us bothered to show up to vote. Why? Because it’s hard to stand in line at the ballot box when neither candidate promises anything more than politics as usual. Texans, supposedly, are the most independent-thinking people in the once-United States, but if were going to be inspired, the inspiration will have to come from leaders unafraid to deal in new ideas and honest answers. We need leaders who let the people call the plays instead of dancing to the tune of the moneymen. This kind of leader is never going to look or sound like a politician. He won’t speak in hollow phrases, steer by image polls, or show up in hand-tailored suits. True Texas leaders are unmistakable. After all, the last independent governor of Texas was Sam Houston. That was more than 154 years ago. He turned out to be the most visionary governor Texas has ever had. I don't believe Sam Houston would regard too highly the political landscape we see today. He would’ve detested the fact that we have a government of the money, by the money, and for the money. Sam never liked politicians much anyway, and neither do I.

It's a tragedy - however it is a tragedy that can be mended with the proper work. Already a comprehensive bill has been proposed to target poverty, especially in rural areas. These new welfare provisions, while contreversial with One Republicites and Independent Republicans, have passed the Democrat-controlled House and Senate with comfortable margins. The commonly-dubbed 'Second War on Poverty' seeks to substantially invest in the Texan countryside and underdeveloped urban areas, creating several make-work infrastructure projects aimed at expaning employment oppurtunities to all Texans, and restoring the Office of Economic Opportunity, an agency established by President Johnson-Robb's father which has since been abolished due to the fall of the United States. While Conservatives have put these attempts to eradicate poverty on blast, declaring them to be another example of wasteful Democrat spending, LBJR's widespread popularity has convinced a large bloc within the IR caucus to support the President's agenda with certain provisions.

The past, as it stands, remains buried, and we can't dwell on the what-if's of history. What matters is burying the harmful legacy of Reagan's fateful Presidency, undoing the harmful policies which saw the Great Society shredded under the whims of an anti-'Big Government' agenda - an agenda which ultimatley led to the end of America as we know it. The time has come to restore the New Deal across Texas, as Lynda Bird Johnson-Robb moves to restore her father's lifetime work. Economic inequality remains the greatest threat to Texas, aside from possibly the machnications of Atlanta, and President Johnson-Robb seeks to do everything in her power to ensure that a solution to this problem is presented. The 'Free Market' gospel preached by Reagan and Perry has failed to make a dent in poverty nationwide, and it's clear that if we wish to strike a blow againt inequality, extensive Government intervention is nescacary. The 'Small Government' creed, tainted by Reagan and further made irrelavent by the Remnant War, has been replaced by the vision of a state that seeks to safeguard the wellbeing of the Texan people.

While much blood was shed to acheive this outcome, the grief over Texas' lost souls have been drown out by the joy of Texas becoming whole once more; a more than acceptable outcome to a nation which only months ago was bracing for its own destruction."

 texas_news.10.d:0 "At a meeting of UN Delegates in Geneva today, Warsaw Pact aligned nations formally brought up a motion to condemn the American Republic for their recent invasion of the Republic of Texas. While the motion was first brought up by the Communist nation of Bulgaria, it quickly gained support from nations across the world, notably including Canada, leader of the Democratic League and inheritor of the USA's Security Council seat, which typically vetoes every motion brought up by a Warsaw Pact nation out of spite. Canada has recently joined their arch-enemies in the Soviet Union in condemning the Republic's actions, even going so far as to send weapons to the Republic. While they both maintain different strategic objectives in their support for Texas, the world over has been shocked by the unity in voices condemning Atlanta. However, as the General Secretary declares that [USA.GetLeader]'s actions will not be tolerated, the fact remains that the UN has no way of actually ending the conflict."
 texas_news.10.d_2:0 "At a meeting of UN Delegates in Geneva today, Warsaw Pact aligned nations formally brought up a motion to condemn the American Republic for their recent invasion of the Republic of Texas. As is typical when a Warsaw Pact nation raises a motion in the General Assembly, Canada, leader of the Democratic League and inheritor of the USA's Security Council seat, has vetoed the motion. While the fact that the motion was quashed is not surprising on its own, Canada has recently been gravitating towards their support of the so-called 'American Republic', nicknamed the 'Remnants', the only non-Socialist nation which claims the legacy of the old United States. While relations between Ottawa and Atlanta have previously been frosty, Canada's recent move of support is a sign to many that the Democratic League may be siding with the Remnants ."
