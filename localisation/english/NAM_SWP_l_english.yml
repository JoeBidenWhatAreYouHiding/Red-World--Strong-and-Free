namibia_war.1.d:0 "Although resistance to our government has always been known, it was thought to be a dying trend as we consolidated our control throughout Namibia. Unfortunately, the trend seems to be reversing as news from the north comes in. We have been receiving reports from the Angolan border of a significant increase in attacks by the SWAPO. While they have long been a thorn in our side for many decades now, they have never been this bold with their actions. We have received multiple reports of border crossings by small teams of PLAN fighters, as many of our patrols have come under fire from their forces who are trying to infiltrate the country. The Military High Command in Windhoek has ordered all South West African Territorial Force forces on the Angolan border to go on high alert and prepare for any more incursions from the People’s Liberation Army of Nambia. The government hopes that this will be enough to discourage SWAPO from taking any more action. Politicians and military personnel alike are praying that this is simply an anomaly and not a sign of what is to come."

namibia_war.2.t:0 "SWAPO Overruns Border Military Base"
namibia_war.2.d:0 "It seems that even with our increased security measures on the Angolan border, our military remains unable to deal with the PLAN threat. More incident reports have been sent to Windhoek, detailing a consistent increase of raids on the border from the PLAN, with the insurgents growing bolder and bolder. Most concerning is a report of an incident where PLAN forces overran one of our military installations in the border zone. The insurgents destroyed the base after looting much of its equipment and were able to flee before we could catch them, and it seems they have returned to hiding in the countryside. This attack has raised alarms throughout the SWATF, who have been ordered to reinforce the northern border further and begin preparing for the worst possible scenario, while also demanding an increase in harsh crackdowns on those suspected of collaboration with the PLAN. This attack unfortunately also showed the government the extent of the inefficiencies in the military, as any response was too slow to mobilize allowing the PLAN forces to escape into the countryside."

namibia_war.3.t:0 "SWAPO Crosses the Angolan Border"
namibia_war.3.d:0 "It appears our worst fears have come true, as SWAPO and PLAN forces have moved en masse across the Angolan border following the fall of several of our garrisons and checkpoints throughout the North. This, combined with the growing unrest towards our government, has sufficiently plunged the country into a state of civil war. While this is bad enough, it also seems that the Angolan military has prepared to intervene on the side of the PLAN, and while none of their forces have crossed the border yet, it could spell disaster for any of our military efforts. Already, President [NAM.GetLeader] has reached out to our allies in South Africa for support, and while they have refused any mass military deployments for now, they have agreed to send material aid for the war effort, believing our forces more than capable of striking a decisive blow against these communist insurgents. Namibia's destiny is now in our hands, and the time has come to end the struggle against the red menace and solidify our hold over Namibia."

namibia_war.4.d:0 "While we have been diligently watching the situation in the South, it appears that our work in Namibia is far from complete. Representatives from the People’s Liberation Army of Namibia have reached out to us, requesting that we join in their efforts to liberate Namibia from South Africa. This, as expected, has caused our government to engage in significant debate, as our military officers and elected officials weigh the choice presented to us. Committing to war in Namibia could, despite protestations by the most ardent of revolutionaries, hurt our nation, as while we have full confidence in our allies, there is the potential that the situation on the frontline could radically change in the future. However, such a belief has been refuted by our general staff, who have assured us that the frontline shall hold and that helping Namibia could be a grand blow to both capitalism and the apartheid regime, who have been our great enemies for decades now. While we debate the course we take, time is of the essence as the PLAN and SADF clash throughout Namibia. "

namibia_war.5.d:0 "While our forces are engaged in battle against the South African puppet state, our representatives have returned with joyous news from Angola. Despite fears that our allies would seek to avoid a direct entrance into our conflict, either due to a lack of confidence in their military capabilities or a dwindling belief in the revolutionary spirit, our envoys have now reported that the Angolan government has agreed to our plea for help, confirming that their forces will join us in our fight for the liberation of our home from apartheid's grip. Already, the Angolan military has crossed the Okavango River, and their forces are now on their way to the frontlines in the south. While our prospects of swift emancipation of our lands from Pretoria's grasp were initially low, with the realization of a protracted war quickly setting in shortly after our initial uprising, the arrival of the Namibian Armed Forces, the fears of a lengthy war are now abated, with Windhoek's liberation now imminent!"

namibia_war.6.d:0 "As the liberation of Namibia is now underway, our representatives stationed in Angola have returned with grave news. While we initially believed we could convince our revolutionary allies in Luanda to assist in our war effort, it appears that they have chosen to instead abandon our cause. Citing worries over South African intervention and the already shaky situation internationally, Angola has dedicated itself to limited neutrality, providing only slight assistance with no military help for the foreseeable future. This has caused great concern in our government, as Angolan backing was essential to the successful liberation of Namibia. We have now been cast to the wolves and must defeat the Windhoek government alone, while our former comrades watch on. Nevertheless, we are dedicated to defeating the South African puppet state and liberating the people of Namibia from the shackles of oppression and capitalism once and for all, alone if needed!"

namibia_war.7.d:0 "While we initially believed that the war against the SWAPO would be over quickly, we were unfortunately proven wrong. The conflict has been a continuous struggle, as our forces were forced back at nearly every point. Now, the capital of Windhoek has fallen into rebel hands, and our prospects are looking grim. Thankfully, our benefactors in South Africa have heard our pleas for help, and have finally chosen to fully intervene against the red tide. South African military forces have feverishly begun rushing to the frontlines to reinforce the SWATF, and counterattacks are already being readied. With the help of the South Africans, morale has skyrocketed and our forces have reinvigorated, with the prospects of defeating the SWAPO once and for all looking brighter than ever. Additionally, this might allow us to force concessions on any forces who have decided to foolishly assist the Communists, strengthening our hold on the nation further."

namibia_war.8.d:0 "The War in Namibia proper has finally ended, as joint PLAN and FAPLA forces have secured the nation and pushed the South African Defence Forces out of the country. With South African forces retreating past the Orange River, this has resulted in a heated debate with high command over what we should do next. We have been presented with an opportunity to push over the Orange River and invade South Africa itself, potentially liberating the nation from the Apartheid government once and for all. This, of course, comes with its risks as well. We would be venturing into enemy territory, with the possibility of losing a great number of men to the South Africans and also running the risk of losing our gains in Namibia, rendering all of our efforts over the years me aningless. Some members believe the positives outweigh the negatives by a great amount, with the enticing possibility of our last chance to destroy Apartheid captivating many of our soldiers. This begs the question, do we send a peace offering where we keep Namibia, or do we continue past the Orange River and gamble it all for total liberation?"

This, however, could not be further from the truth, as our allies in Windhoek have been toppled, and Namibia lost. While this was bad enough, our greatest fears have been proven true, as SWAPO and Angolan forces have crossed the Orange River, bringing the war to our nation. This has sent the populace into a panic, with white citizens increasing volunteer numbers to the military, while our African population has begun mass protests against our government, leading to fighting in the streets. Simultaneously, the economy has seen a major crash as civilians leave their homes and flee their jobs, further spiraling the nation. The high command has assured us that we will surely survive anything the Reds throw at us and that we will endure this struggle like we have many others.

As our forces lick their wounds, we have received a message from the Reds to the north, laying out a peace negotiation where Namibia is turned over to the SWAPO, and we recognize them as the legitimate Namibian government. In return, the Angolan-SWAPO alliance will not push past the Orange River, leaving our heartland intact. This has led to a heated debate in the government, as our politicians and generals have begun to debate the best course of action. By accepting the offer, we could safeguard our nation against any possible damage the Reds would cause with an invasion, although we would be accepting our loss of Namibia and our government could suffer great consequences such as unrest from the more radical White populace or the military. If we deny it, on the other hand, we could still try and save Namibia from the clutches of socialism and return it to our grasp, at the risk of total invasion and annihilation by the Angolan-SWAPO forces. We must choose where we sail our nation's future, whether we accept this loss and count our losses or risk it all for the greatest victory."

Celebrations have erupted throughout the country, with large parties and raves occurring in our major cities. With this victory, we have officially brought liberation to the people of Namibia, with the declaration of the People’s Republic signaling an end to South African adventurism and signaling a major period of reconstruction for the people. Already, governments have contacted us from multiple socialist and left-wing nations, have congratulated us and offered international recognition. While the war has ended, the struggle for equality and liberation is just beginning. While it is unfortunate that many of our people are trapped across the Orange River, we must first look inward at repairing the damage done to our own.

While disappointing, we had already prepared for this situation, and have ordered heavy shelling of South African Defence Force stations throughout the border.

Celebrations have erupted throughout Namibia and Cuba, as the forces of Apartheid were struck a heavy blow. Even with this jovial mood, however, an important question remains. Should we stop here, guaranteeing Namibian independence yet giving up the chance to liberate all of South Africa, or do we march to Pretoria itself, to strike the killing blow against the South African regime once and for all but risking a costly war and all our gains to this point?

Alternatively, we can simply sign a ceasefire with South Africa, securing Namibia from the illegal occupation but forcing Cuba to fight on her own and possibly losing the chance to end apartheid here and now.

It seems these hopes would not be founded, as representatives from [PREV.GetName] Have confirmed to us that their nation would not join us in the war, and would be seeking a ceasefire with South Africa. This comes as an immeasurable disappointment to the Cuban nation, as some military officers accuse them of being traitors to the cause, while others have simply accepted the reality and moved on to focus on the war effort.

Pretoria has put forward a surprisingly generous ceasefire proposal, given the circumstances. The terms demand no concessions beyond recognizing the South African puppet state in Namibia, a bitter pill but one that would at least secure Angola as a socialist bastion in Southern Africa. To accept would mean cutting our losses, securing the revolution where we still can, and preventing further bloodshed. But to reject it?

The red tide has been rolled back, and the Revolutionary Armed Forces, humiliated in retreat, now look inward, forced to dissect their failures and understand how their grand offensive unraveled so catastrophically. In Pretoria, the mood is triumphant. The specter of insurgency that has loomed over the nation for generations has been vanquished, the border secured, and the ideological war against communist expansionism won on the battlefield. Streets fill with celebrations, and the government hails the victory as a testament to the resilience and determination of the Republic. Yet, beneath the euphoria, an unspoken reality lingers, this war was more than a military confrontation. It was a battle of ideologies, and while the rifles may fall silent, the political struggle continues.

Our forces stand prepared to drive the final nail into the coffin of communist ambitions in Southern Africa, to press forward until the jungles of Angola no longer shelter those who threaten our borders. The SADF, tempered by decades of insurgency, knows this terrain, understands the stakes, and refuses to accept anything less than total security. There will be no more overtures, no more negotiations. If Havana will not accept peace, then it will find only defeat.

A proposal now circulates among the halls of government: formal recognition of Angola’s socialist regime in exchange for their acceptance of the current Namibian state. It is a pragmatic offer, one that could spare us from the burdens of prolonged occupation, the economic drain of war, and the intensifying glare of international scrutiny. With our position secured, some argue, why gamble everything on another brutal campaign? Yet, among the hardliners, the argument is clear, this is not the time for half-measures. With PLAN shattered and Angola vulnerable, the moment has come to strike a final blow, to extinguish the communist threat at its root, regardless of the cost.

Through neutral intermediaries, a peace offer has arrived, recognition of our government in Luanda in exchange for ceasing all support to PLAN and acknowledging the Namibian regime. A bitter compromise, yet undeniably a generous one given the circumstances. Within the government, the debate is fierce. Many argue that now is the time to accept, consolidate our position, and secure what remains of the revolution rather than risk everything in an unwinnable struggle. With Havana’s betrayal still fresh, the prospect of continued war without reliable allies grows increasingly dire. A chance for peace, however flawed, may be the only way to preserve our hard-fought gains. Yet among the hardliners, another vision emerges. The SADF and their Cuban collaborators may feel emboldened by their victory, but the Angolan jungles remain an unforgiving battlefield. Luring them in, stretching their supply lines, and bleeding them dry in a drawn-out guerrilla war could yet turn the tide."

namibia_war.31.d:0 "In a move that has stunned both us and the world, Pretoria has announced that it will accept nothing short of our total and unconditional surrender. Rejecting all diplomatic pressure from the United Nations, from its few remaining allies, and even from those who had urged restraint, South Africa has cast aside all pretenses of a limited conflict. What began as a battle for Namibia has now transformed into a full-scale invasion. Already, the consequences are dire. Our coastline is blockaded, our positions along the Okavango River face relentless bombardment, and our forces are strained against an enemy determined to see our revolution wiped from the map. From Luanda to the deepest jungles, the government has declared total resistance, vowing to fight until the last soldier, until the last village, until the last breath. Even as we stand defiant, our pleas for international support grow more desperate. We will call upon our allies, all nations that believe in self-determination, to stand with us in this moment of reckoning. If South Africa seeks our destruction, then let them come. The jungles of Angola will not be so easily conquered, and history has shown that those who underestimate the resolve of the people often find themselves buried by it."

namibia_war.32.d:0 "Luanda has seen reason. Their government, faced with the grim reality of prolonged war and mounting isolation, has agreed to the terms laid before them. The last embers of resistance are snuffed out, and with the signing of the accord, the war in Southern Africa comes to a definitive close. In Pretoria, jubilation has filled the streets as the victorious SADF parade through the capital. Soldiers who bled in the Okavango and along the Namibian frontier now march in triumph, cheered on by a nation that has endured decades of conflict to reach this moment. Their Cuban allies, present but subdued, mark the occasion with tempered acknowledgment rather than elation, victors, yes, but ones whose loyalties have left a bitter aftertaste. Meanwhile, in Havana, [CUB.GetLeader] has delivered a grand oration, declaring this moment not just a triumph for South Africa, but for the free world itself. Along the former front lines, the guns have finally fallen silent. Prisoners of war are exchanged, weary soldiers returning home to a world that has moved forward without them, and in Namibia, the arduous process of reconstruction begins. Whatever Pretoria envisions for its newest ally, one thing is clear, the war may be over, but the battle for Southern Africa’s future is only just beginning."

namibia_war.33.d:0 "Despite the overwhelming firepower of the South African Defense Force, despite the relentless assaults and the tightening blockade, Luanda has refused to bow. The Angolan government has formally rejected all offers of peace, vowing instead to wage a war of resistance, no matter the cost. We had expected reason to prevail, that Angola’s leaders would see the futility of further bloodshed. Instead, they have chosen defiance, retreating into the depths of the jungle, where supply lines stretch thin, and the terrain favors the desperate. What was once a conventional war now threatens to become something far more insidious, a grinding, unforgiving insurgency. With no choice but to press forward, the SADF has prepared for the next phase of the campaign. Victory in Namibia had been swift, but Angola presents a different challenge entirely. The cities may fall, and the airfields may burn, but the war will not end with the capture of Luanda. The jungles, the rivers, the remote villages, all may become battlegrounds in a fight that could stretch on for years."

namibia_war.34.d:0 "Against all odds, against the full might of the SADF and the tactical expertise of their Cuban allies, the red banners now fly over Windhoek. In what can only be described as a miracle, FAPLA forces, outgunned, outmanned, outnumbered, and outplanned, have driven the enemy beyond the Orange River. Namibia, at last, is free, and Angola stands as its sole protector. Yet, even in victory, we understand the limits of war. The tides of battle have turned, but time is not on our side. A long and drawn-out conflict risks eroding all that has been gained. While the moment of strength still lasts, we have reached out to Pretoria, offering terms to bring this war to an end: recognition of SWAPO as the rightful government of Namibia, the surrender of Walvis Bay, and, in return, a pledge to cease all hostilities against South Africa itself, a true and lasting peace. But within the ranks of the victorious army, some voices rise in protest. The war has not just been about Namibia; it has been about liberation, about striking at the very heart of the apartheid regime. Why stop now? With the enemy in retreat, with morale at its highest, why not push further, cross the Orange, and bring the revolution to those still in chains?"

What should have been a textbook defense against an outmatched foe has instead collapsed into a full retreat. Now, the once-mighty South African forces find themselves desperately holding the line at the Orange River, as shock and disbelief grip the nation. The chaos is no longer confined to the battlefield. At home, panic spreads like wildfire. The streets of Pretoria, Johannesburg, and Cape Town seethe with unrest, as anti-apartheid movements grow bolder, sensing weakness in a government that once projected invincibility. The ruling elite, who had promised swift victory, now whisper in hushed voices, fearful of what comes next. A proposal has landed on the President’s desk via neutral intermediaries, demanding total withdrawal from Namibia, including Walvis Bay, in exchange for peace. For many in the cabinet, it is the only way out. They see the writing on the wall, murmuring that if they do not accept now, they may not live to negotiate later. The mob is growing restless. The state wavers. If the war does not end, something else surely will. But even in this moment of desperation, some refuse to bend."

namibia_war.36.d:0 "Defying all expectations, the enemy has not stopped at Windhoek. In a thunderous proclamation broadcast from Luanda and Windhoek alike, the Angolan and Namibian forces have declared that the war for Namibia is now a war for total liberation, a war to free the oppressed black majority within South Africa’s borders. What was once a distant war on foreign soil has now become an existential battle within our borders. The townships erupt in flames as riots spread like wildfire. Roadways once safe for government patrols now turn into death traps as ambushes increase by the hour. Armed resistance, once kept to the fringes, now explodes in full force, emboldened by the enemy’s call to arms. As a direct result, White South Africans have started to flee southward, desperate to escape the specter of an insurrection they once dismissed as impossible. The government, caught off-guard by the rapid escalation, now scrambles to reassert control. A general mobilization of the SADF has been declared, calling every available soldier to the front. Martial law has been enacted nationwide, curfews, emergency powers, and brutal crackdowns enforced in the name of national survival."

What once seemed an impossible struggle has ended in total victory, the last vestiges of colonial rule shattered, the red, green, and blue of Namibia’s flag now flying high, unshackled at last. From Luanda to Dar es Salaam, from Accra to Algiers, the streets are alive with celebration. The impossible has been achieved: a nation, long denied its freedom, has thrown off the yoke of apartheid-backed rule. No longer a battleground, Namibia now belongs to its people, and its future is no longer dictated by Pretoria. Yet even amid triumph, the road ahead looms long and uncertain. Liberation is not the same as reconstruction, and war has left scars not so easily healed. The work of building a nation, of ensuring that Namibia never again falls into foreign hands, begins now. But today, at least, belongs to victory, to the knowledge that the flame of revolution has not only endured but prevailed."

Their armies, reeling from their unexpected defeat in Namibia, have not conceded, they have only paused. Now, as they scramble to recover from their losses, the specter of a renewed offensive looms over our borders. There is no illusion of an easy victory. The enemy still possesses overwhelming strength in air power, armor, and logistics. What they lack is the spirit that has carried us this far, the fire that drove them from Namibia and sent their forces reeling back toward the Orange River. Every soldier, every revolutionary, every worker must now steel themselves for the storm ahead. The lines must be reinforced, the defenses hardened, and the nation prepared to resist whatever Pretoria throws our way. Meanwhile, our diplomats work tirelessly, seeking arms, supplies, and political backing from those who have stood with us. We cannot stand alone against such a superior force, but together, with the support of our allies across the world, we will endure."

namibia_news.1.t:0 "Outbreak of the Namibian Civil War"
namibia_news.1.d:0 "It seems the fragile balance in Southern Africa has completely collapsed, as the Republic of Namibia has fallen into chaos following the seizure of much of the country's north in a surprise assault by the South West African People's Organization. Launching an incursion from Angola, SWAPO has declared that their insurgency shall only end once the People's Liberation Army of Namibia has raised their flag in Windhoek and removed the stain of apartheid from their borders. Mobilizing the South West African Territorial Force, [NAM.GetLeader] has vowed to destroy the rebels before they can consolidate their gains. While [SAF.GetLeader] has reportedly placed their full backing behind SWATF, it appears as though the South African Defense Force is, for now, remaining neutral in the conflict, agreeing to only supply their allies with weapons and ammunition, either out of a belief in the capabilities of Namibia or a refusal to further anger the international community. While the United Nations has, likewise, followed the example set by South Africa such an example is likely to be broken in the coming months as it seems unlikely that should the war turn against Windhoek, Pretoria would simply watch as their allies are overrun by a rag-tag group of socialists."

namibia_news.2.d:0 "The already precarious situation in Southern Africa has today escalated further, as the Republic of Cuba has now declared its intentions to join the ongoing war between the recently liberated Namibia and South Africa. Promising to return to the aid of their past allies, [CUB.GetLeader] has promised the total emancipation and liberation of all oppressed African peoples, declaring that their war shall only conclude once the Cuban flag flies over Pretoria. While the rivalry between Havana and Pretoria stretches as far back as 1975, the declaration of war has surprised the international community, as most assumed that Cuban involvement would be limited to arms shipments and advisors rather than direct conflict between the two powers. With condemnation from the United Nations now arriving in Havana for their escalation of hostilities, Pretoria has attempted to utilize this declaration to position itself as a nation under attack in the hopes of receiving the backing of some states. While such support is unlikely, South Africa's position as a nation defending itself from foreign aggression is hard to deny. With the Cuban military now making overtures to Namibia and Angola, it seems only a matter of time before the Revolutionary Armed Forces make their first landing on Namibian soil."

namibia_news.3.d:0 "Following months of devastating conflict between the People's Liberation Army of Namibia and the South African Defense Force, delegations from the newly liberated [SWA.GetName] and [SAF.GetName] have met in Walvis Bay, Namibia, to finalize the terms of a treaty that will further isolate Pretoria from the world. While having initially refused to involve the SADF in the conflict, the rapid advance of PLAN and their allies forced the hand of President [SAF.GetLeader], who has now paid the price for his naivety. Despite the long-fought struggle for independence, the new Namibian government and its allies have drafted a relatively lax set of demands for the South African government, with the terms of the Treaty of Walvis Bay stating that Pretoria is to withdraw all forces from Namibia and recognize the new government headed by [SWA.GetLeader]. Having accepted the treaty's terms with little hesitation, likely due to the rising tide of protests across Johannesburg, Cape Town, and Pretoria, the [SAF.GetName] now stands at the precipice of destruction. Unless these protests are dealt with soon, it is entirely likely that the SWAPO insurgency and Treaty of Walvis Bay may signal the beginning of the end of near seven decades of apartheid rule."

While having initially refused to involve the SADF in the conflict, the rapid advance of PLAN and their allies forced the hand of President [SAF.GetLeader], who have now successfully driven the insurgents back across the border. With little chance to cross the Okavango or Cunene rivers again, the defeated Angolan government has now been forced to accept a return to the status quo, with the Treaty of Walvis Bay demanding that Luanda recognize the Namibian government and end their support of SWAPO, lest they wish to continue the war to their capital. Though hesitant to agree, the Angolan government has begun to follow the terms imposed onto them, with tensions now at an all time high between [ANG.GetLeader] and the remnants of SWAPO’s leadership. However, despite the signature of the treaty, PLAN insurgents have vowed to continue their assaults against the Namibian government refusing to ever accept apartheid rule over Windhoek."
