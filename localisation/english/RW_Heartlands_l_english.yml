 MWA_extensive_decentralization:0 "Extensive Decentralization"
 MWA_extensive_decentralization_desc:0 "The rural character of our Union has necessitated the need for a heavily decentralized administration. This approach, championed by President Hammons, has both its detractors and supporters, with many, particularly on the right, favouring this system due to our territory's Agrarian and Localist nature, while others declare that the approach of designating so much authority to local administration has created a two-tier society with a lopsided application of the law. Outside of Hammons' coalition, support for such levels of Decentralization is sparse, and many predict that the issue will play a key role in the next election - if it ever arrives."
 MWA_lawless_countryside:0 "Widespread Lawlessness"
 MWA_lawless_countryside_desc:0 "While our Union is far from existing in a state of Anarchy, crime and lawlessness, especially in the more rural areas, has become a very significant concern. In looked-over towns across Middle America, local officials have taken the laws into their own hands, leading to the creation of highly-dangerous fiefdoms founded by either criminals or renegade law enforcement officers across our nation. As well, petty crime, especially within the countryside, has risen to out-of-control levels, further allowing these problems to spill into major urban areas. Overall, the skyrocketing crime in rampant areas is a problem we can no longer ignore, even if some are entirely content doing so."

 MWA_clarks_return:0 "Clark's Return"
 MWA_clarks_return_desc:0 "The bitter failure of the Centrist Establishment has forced the hand of General Clark. With Denver rendered useless by constant deadlock, it has been decided that only the steady hand of former President Wesley J. Clark, who promises to end the political stalemate and at last restore America to its former glory. The question is, does Clark have the means to do so?"
 MWA_silence_establishment_bickering:0 "Silence Establishment Bickering"
 MWA_silence_establishment_bickering_desc:0 "The divided political scene of our great nation was indeed the driving force behind General Clark's decision. The countless establishment politicians who have never experienced the glory of military service have no right to dictate the running of the Heartlands. Only an iron fist and an iron will will protect ourselves from the trappings of political deadlock."
 MWA_unrepentant_militarism:0 "Unrepentant Militarism"
 MWA_unrepentant_militarism_desc:0 "America's restoration is set to be no easy task. Our nation's own diminutive stature in comparison to the Commonwealth and the UAPR has come as a great disadvantage to us. If we are to secure victory on the great American battlefield, then we must instill a sense of martial discipline within the minds and the bodies of our populace. Under the great American Napoleon, we shall secure the restoration of our beloved United States, and at last banish weakness off the face of our continent."
 MWA_civilian_corps:0 "New Civilian Corps"
 MWA_civilian_corps_desc:0 "There remain some within our nation who are either incapable or unwilling to devote themselves to a life in the Military, these people, despite their incapability of serving the Heartlands on the battlefield, still have a valuable part to play in the restoration of the United States. Under Clark's guidance, we shall restore the AmeriCorps, allowing those who cannot serve to contribute to the rebirth of our great American Experiment."
 MWA_gay_marrige:0 "Legalize Gay Marriage"
 MWA_gay_marrige_desc:0 "General Clark has observed that under his command lie countless proud Americans from countless stripes of life. Among those who proudly serve our country are Homosexuals who still cannot marry, leaving their significant others without compensation in the event of their death. This cannot stand. Under Clark's iron fist, Gay Marriage shall be at last legalized within the Heartlands."
 MWA_liberal_social_policy:0 "Liberal Social Policy"
 MWA_liberal_social_policy_desc:0 "On the battlefield, it doesn't matter the colour of one's skin nor the alignment of their sexuality. Those who have been so brave as to stand for the new America come from countless walks of life - and Clark will not tolerate those who dare to disparage any proud American patriot. Our policy shall be one of unabashed Social Liberalism, protecting men and women both enlisted and otherwise. A strict code of anti-Racism shall be adopted, and the rights to Abortion will be protected."
 MWA_clean_air_and_water:0 "Clean Air and Water"
 MWA_clean_air_and_water_desc:0 "The changing climate has become a fact of plain observation to most within the world, however here in the Heartlands some have been so bold as to deny the existence of our shifting ecosystem. Clark, recognizing the health and welfare of our populace as paramount, has enacted strict regulation to contain airborne and waterborne pollutants, and prepare the Heartlands for a climate-friendly future."
 MWA_the_new_eisenhower:0 "In the Footsteps of Great Men"
 MWA_the_new_eisenhower_desc:0 "As the Heartlands looks to their uniform-clad savior, General-turned-President Clark has utilized his prowess to inspire a new generation of true Americans. With an Eisenhowerian demeanor and a style of leadership born from the teachings of Napoleon himself, Wesley Clark is determined to shape America in his image... or die trying."
 MWA_new_american_patriotism:0 "New American Patriotism"
 MWA_new_american_patriotism_desc:0 "After 1987 many considered the concept of 'America' to be lost to the dust of Reaganism. Yet now, a new Patriotism has been born by General Clark's efforts - one which has seen the values of the Stars and Stripes reborn here in the Heartlands after decades of decay. While Separatists may wince at this cultural shift, it has become clear that the only way forward is to restore the mighty United States."
 MWA_new_healthcare_system:0 "Public Healthcare System"
 MWA_new_healthcare_system_desc:0 "If we are to restore the American Experiment built by our founding fathers, we must realize the gravitas of our national situation. Within the Heartlands, countless languish without sufficient access to healthcare. The access to such vital care has become a luxury to many. This cannot stand. At once, we must create a single-payer healthcare system within our new United States."
 MWA_clarks_america:0 "Clark's American Restoration"
 MWA_clarks_america_desc:0 "At long last, the armies of the Heartlands have broken through the gates of Olympus. While some have called the General mad for daring to dream, it seems that Denver's gamble has paid off in the end. The Stars and Stripes once more wave proudly from Sea to Shining Sea. Yet there is much work to be done if we are to truly restore the American Dream. Let us begin."
 MWA_reaching_light_speed:0 "Reaching Light Speed"
 MWA_reaching_light_speed_desc:0 "One oft-forgotten yet still tragic consequence of the Soviet Union's victory in the Cold War was the abandonment of global space exploration. With NASA proudly being restored following Reunification, President Clark has begun an extensive program to help conquer the frontiers of tomorrow. We must push ourselves to conquer the stars; light-speed technology shall soon be within our grasp."
 MWA_loyal_congress:0 "Subordinate Congress"
 MWA_loyal_congress_desc:0 "With the halls of power in new Washington being staffed by men in uniform, the purpose of Congress has seemed exhausted to many. However Clark fancies himself as no dictator, despite the complaints of countless detractors. The time has come to release the Military's hold on civilian government - so long as they prove willing to do what's best for America."
 MWA_military_role_in_reconstruction:0 "AmeriCorp Reconstruction"
 MWA_military_role_in_reconstruction_desc:0 "America has been left in ruins ever since the war of reclamation. With President Clark having restored the AmeriCorps before the Great War, we already have a hearty Civilian Corps dedicated to assisting the military in matters of reconstruction. Now, we can expand these efforts across the new United States, and slowly yet surely restore America to its pre-1987 glory."
 MWA_new_internationalism:0 "Revive the Internationalist Crusade"
 MWA_new_internationalism_desc:0 "The cause of Capitalism, to many, was vanquished unquestionably after the disaster of 1987. Under Clark's guide, we have undoubtedly proven them wrong. And yet still, those who deny the need for America to reclaim its place on the World Stage exist. We must prove these doubters wrong, and restore the pride and prowess that the USA once enjoyed. Onward, to Europe!"
 
 MWA_paleocons:0 "Paleoconservative Recovery"
 MWA_paleocons_desc:0 "Few would have expected the Paleoconservative crusade of Buchanan and Tancredo to be victorious on the stage of Heartlander politics. Now, this burgeoning movement, ready to reject the decades of past failures, has stepped up to usher in an era of unabashed Conservatism across the American Midwest. While some may scoff at the President's efforts, [MWA.GetLeader] will not allow the jeers of Liberals and Communists distract him from his efforts to restore the American Dream."
 MWA_revive_the_vision_of_ashbrook:0 "Rehabilitate Ashbrook"
 MWA_revive_the_vision_of_ashbrook_desc:0 "A young Pat Buchanan first got his political career started in John Ashbrook's White House. While the Liberal media has been ever eager to vilify Ashbrook in the aftermath of the Spanish affair, the facts remain that Ashbrook was a true paragon of Conservative values in stark contrast to the failed Liberalism of Reagan and Bush. The time has come to set the record straight."
 MWA_a_second_conservative_revolution:0 "A True Conservative Revolution"
 MWA_a_second_conservative_revolution_desc:0 "Despite the pitiful attempts of 'Moderates' such as Rodham, the fact remains that the New Right is the only movement with the legitimacy to represent the Conservative movement in the Heartlands. Buchanan, himself an exile from the watered-down Conservatism of the Bush era, is determined to bring his fervently isolationist vision to the forefront of Heartlander politics - icing out any who may stand in his way."
 MWA_heartland_values:0 "Strict Social Conservatism"
 MWA_heartland_values_desc:0 "While Liberals and Communists may be eager to preach the gospel of Homosexuality and Abortion instead of the irrefutable word of our one lord God, President Buchanan knows well enough that the good God-fearing people of the Heartlands won't be fooled by such drivel. We shall aim to protect our Midwestern family values against all those who seek to erode the Nuclear Family in the name of 'Progress' and 'Tolerance'."
 MWA_new_nativism:0 "New Nativism"
 MWA_new_nativism_desc:0 "America's values are under attack. Such is clear to anybody who has been paying attention to the last 20 years. While the Communists in Philadelphia and Los Angeles attempt to destroy the American Way of Life, and do-nothing politicians in Atlanta stand by, President Buchanan is eager to protect American heritage. The time has come to reach back, restore the spirit of the Know-Nothings."
 MWA_appeal_to_patriotic_leftists:0 "Appeal to Patriotic Leftists"
 MWA_appeal_to_patriotic_leftists_desc:0 "While this stance may come off as confusing to many within our own camp, President Buchanan realizes that not all on the other side of the spectrum are an entirely lost cause. Working with figures such as Lenora Fulani, Buchanan shall work to create a formidable alliance with those on the left, including the many Trade Unions which call the Heartlands Home."
 MWA_media_empire:0 "A Media Empire"
 MWA_media_empire_desc:0 "Controlling the narrative is key to maintaining political power in this day and age. The rise of Cable Television and Talk Radio has provided Conservatism with a fertile new ground for expanding grassroots support. Utilizing our connections within the Radio and Television scene, the Paleoconservative movement shall aim to shape the narrative through friendly broadcasts and coverage, all while buying out stations critical to our message."
 MWA_paleocon_america:0 "Ashbrook Avenged"
 MWA_paleocon_america_desc:0 "At last the Communists, Liberals and false Conservatives have been driven from the face of the United States. While some had been content in our own self-imposed isolation, Buchanan and his Paleoconservative movement have pulled off the impossible, bringing back the United States and restoring the legacy of President Ashbrook. Our forefathers would be proud of us."
 MWA_victory_in_the_culture_war:0 "Victory in the Culture War"
 MWA_victory_in_the_culture_war_desc:0 "At last, our struggle against Homosexuality, Abortion and Anti-Christian Values has been won by the iron fist of the Paleoconservative movement. With Congress under the President's control, we can at last codify our efforts, ensuring that America remains a morally upstanding nation worthy of God's love. No longer shall 'Liberals' and Communists be able to use the cause of sinners as a cudgel against our movement."
 MWA_liquidate_communism:0 "Liquidate Communism"
 MWA_liquidate_communism_desc:0 "So much of our nation spent decades languishing under the tyranny of Communists, Socialist and Liberal forces. With Conservatism at last conquering the halls of power in Washington, we can at last mobilize our forces to at last stamp out the Hammer and Sickle. The FBI and the New CIA shall be dispatched to destroy any remains of the Communist Jackboot on our soil, and ensure that any form of Communism, be it Marxism or Liberalism, is never allowed to flourish on American soil."
 MWA_strict_isolationism:0 "Strict Isolationism"
 MWA_strict_isolationism_desc:0 "Our great work in securing the American continent has been finished. While we detest the wicked forces of Communism across the mighty Atlantic, it is no longer America's place to play World Police. For too long Conservative paragons such as Ashbrook and false Communistic Liberal agents such as Rumsfeld have been caught up in Interventionism's siren call. No longer."
 MWA_a_republic_not_an_empire:0 "A Republic, Not An Empire"
 MWA_a_republic_not_an_empire_desc:0 "The America First policy has finally proved its worth. As the rest of the World remains locked in bitter ideological conflict, America focuses on rebuilding the shattered streets and lives, repairing our nation after the devastation incurred during the Reclamation War. While Buchanan may no longer be running the show, his vision has prevailed, and at long last, Paleoconservativism has proven its worth to even the most seditious of Liberals."
 
 MWA_miller:0 "Miller's Presidency"
 MWA_miller_desc:0 "By far the most unlikely player on the political scene has stepped up in the Heartland's hour of need. Merlin Miller, backed by his infamous 'Eagles' Paramilitary, has secured power in the Union of the Heartlands, promising a crackdown on all Communists and non-Christians within our territory. While we appreciate Buchanan's contributions, saving America is a job for President Miller alone."
 MWA_reach_out_to_tanceredo:0 "Reach out to Tancredo"
 MWA_reach_out_to_tanceredo_desc:0 "Speaker Tancredo was the most critical supporter of the House's coup against Udall. While Tancredo shares Miller's virulent hatred of immigrants, he has also expressed skepticism towards the more 'Radical' portions of Miller's agenda. Facilitating a meeting with friendly representatives such as Representative Gosar, we shall secure the Speaker's loyalty - which will further aid in efforts to push through Miller's agenda."
 MWA_protect_our_european_american_heritage:0 "Protect our Euro-American Heritage"
 MWA_protect_our_european_american_heritage_desc:9 "The forces of Globalism have long sought to dilute America's racial identity with immigration and interracial marriage. While we have no desire to formally illegalize such practices, our stance must be made clear - miscegenation is a threat to the United States - any while we hold no ill will towards minorities, we must protect America's white majority. We are a Party for White Americans."
 MWA_a_new_hollywood:0 "Rebuild Hollywood"
 MWA_a_new_hollywood_desc:0 "Even before its takeover by Communist forces, Hollywood was polluted by Zionist forces attempting to brainwash Americans into doing their bidding. Miller, himself a prolific filmmaker, has sought to recapture control of the media, creating a booming new film industry here in the Heartlands, one which will produce proud pro-American narratives instead of churning out anti-American dreck."
 MWA_heartland_shield_against_globalism:0 "A Shield Against Globalism"
 MWA_heartland_shield_against_globalism_desc:0 "The Soviet Union has long used their dominance over global affairs as an excuse to force their wicked Zionist creed down the throats of honest folk. The time has come to stand against these efforts to corrupt American identity. The Heartlands is America's shield against Globalism, proudly fending off the UAPR's wicked Bolshevik creed and the false Conservatism of Atlanta."
 MWA_legacy_of_the_lone_eagle:0 "Rehabilitate the Lone Eagle"
 MWA_legacy_of_the_lone_eagle_desc:0 "Charles Lindbergh was a great American Patriot unfairly vilified by the Zionist media due to his unflinching dedication to peace. The Lone Eagle has long been a symbol of Miller's movement, and with our newfound control over the Media, we can finally set the record straight about this brave American hero."
 MWA_empower_the_eagles:0 "Let Loose the Eagles"
 MWA_empower_the_eagles_desc:0 "President Miller's feared Paramilitary, the Eagles, is the few lines between the people of the Heartlands and utter bedlam. These heroes shall be empowered to dispense justice at Miller's command, dealing with malcontents and providing a visible line of defense against the forces of Communism and Liberalism."
 MWA_millers_america:0 "Miller's America"
 MWA_millers_america_desc:0 "At long last, the forces of Abortion, Homsexuality, Liberalism, Race-Mixing and Communism have been destroyed by President Miller's righteous Iron Fist. No more shall America be terrorized by Bolshevik-Zionist regimes. From now on, America shall be reconstructed along the lines of strength and patriotism."
 MWA_protect_american_race:0 "Protect the American Race"
 MWA_protect_american_race_desc:0 "Americans have been under attack from sinister forces for more than two decades. From the onset of the Civil Rights movement, insidious forces have conspired to exterminate the White Race on American Soil. Thankfully, President Miller has taken decisive action to stop the destruction of our heritage, protecting our heritage and tradition against the forces of Race Communism which seek to destroy our way of life."
 MWA_strike_centers_of_finance:0 "Strike the Centers of Finance"
 MWA_strike_centers_of_finance_desc:0 "President Miller is no one to hate the Jewish race. However he cannot accept favoritism granted to those within the Hebrew Tribes by members of financial and cultural institutions. Miller's comprehensive purge of the banks shall be the first step in combatting Zionist influence in the new United States."
 MWA_a_return_to_true_americanism:0 "A Return to Tradition"
 MWA_a_return_to_true_americanism_desc:0 "Miller's America has at last undone the damage done by decades of Communism and Liberalism. While some within the Paleoconservative movement are willing to sit on their hands as Communism destroys the forces of Christianity and Tradition across the globe, Miller knows better than to sit idly by while Bolshevism festers. Communism must be annihilated, both at home, and abroad."
 MWA_seal_our_borders:0 "Seal Our Borders"
 MWA_seal_our_borders_desc:0 "America's borders have remained porous ever since the Great Collapse, allowing the spawn of foreign hordes to recklessly invade our soil. The time has come at last to shut our borders to these anti-American agitators, ensuring once and for all that America is safe from the lingering taint of foreigners."
 MWA_a_christian_heartlands:0 "A Christian Heartlands"
 MWA_a_christian_heartlands_desc:0 "While the Marx-worshiping Atheists in the Liberal Communist movement wish to tear down the Cross and continue the lie of 'Separation of Church and State', the wise leadership of [MWA.GetLeader] will not tolerate those who spread such insidious anti-Christian creed within our borders. This is God's country. America is a Christian Nation."
 MWA_empower_the_police:0 "Support the Police"
 MWA_empower_the_police_desc:0 "The state of veritable Anarchy in the Heartlands has been caused by limp-wristed politicians afraid to punish criminals who continue to harass honest folk. The time has come to empower our boys in blue to take care of business, at last sidelining the pitiful whining of those who care more about the rights of criminals than the rights of everyday Americans."
 
 MWA_buffet:0 "Warren Buffet's Rise"
 MWA_buffet_desc:0 "The failure of both the Central Government and the Libertarian experiment of Koch has led to the rise of a new form of Liberalism in the Heartlands. While decried by some as a new 'Dictatorship', Buffet's new American experiment seeks to safeguard our nation's prosperity while also balancing it with meeting the needs of the people."
 MWA_tax_the_rich:0 "Tax the Rich"
 MWA_tax_the_rich_desc:0 "While some would naturally expect Buffet, the richest man in the Heartlands to be a fervent opponent of taxation on the rich, the President is quite the opposite, instead favouring a new taxation programme which would force the rich to pay their fair share."
 MWA_collaborate_with_democrats:0 "Collaborate with the Democrats"
 MWA_collaborate_with_democrats_desc:0 "Working with allies such as William Clinton, President Buffet has empowered the Democratic Party to represent all Heartlanders, in stark opposition to weak-willed Centrists and the failed regressive policies of the Conservatives. Only under the guise of figures such as Clinton and Hartpence shall our great nation thrive."
 MWA_encourage_consumerism:0 "Encourage Consumerism"
 MWA_encourage_consumerism_desc:0 "Much of the economic downturn has been caused by a lack of consumer confidence in the economy. By restoring consumer confidence in the economy, we can effectively encourage spending and bring the Heartlands economy back into the forefront."
 MWA_improve_workers_rights:0 "Improve Worker's Rights"
 MWA_improve_workers_rights_desc:0 "The anarchic government of the Heartlands before Buffet's seizure of power has allowed for the rights of Workers in our territory to be veritably trampled. Buffet, while typically not on the best terms with the Union, realizes the needs for strong workers rights, allowing all to both prosper and enjoy safe working conditions."
 MWA_public_health_care:0 "Public Health Care System"
 MWA_public_health_care_desc:0 "Liberals like Clinton have long proposed a new Health Care system to replace our existing private system. However it is apparent that these proposals don't go nearly far enough. President Buffet has made the decision to implement a Canadian-style Public Healthcare system which will allow all citizens to access high-quality care regardless of income."
 MWA_release_congress:0 "Release Congress"
 MWA_release_congress_desc:0 "Although President Buffet may have been brought to power via a coup, the President does not desire the erosion of our Democratic institutions. The time has come to restore the power of Congress, and at last bring Free and Fair elections back to the Union of the Heartlands."
 MWA_encourage_philantropy:0 "Encourage Philanthropy"
 MWA_encourage_philantropy_desc:0 "The spirit of charity is vital for the reconstruction of the American Dream. Buffet, himself a contributor to countless charitable endeavors, seeks to ensure that the rich contribute to the betterment of their fellow citizens. "
 MWA_a_balanced_economy:0 "A Balanced Economy"
 MWA_a_balanced_economy_desc:0 "Unregulated Capitalism has led to complete disaster across countless post-American nations. Buffet, himself a man of great wealth, recognizes that the pursuit of profit is no excuse for the trampling of human rights and dignity. Strict regulation, alongside a formidable Welfare State, will ensure that the Heartlands thrive under a mixed Keynesian economy."
 MWA_encourage_settlement:0 "Attract Skilled Immigration"
 MWA_encourage_settlement_desc:0 "For too long talent has skipped over the Heartlands in favour of Canada or the Northeast. Under Buffet's rule, the Midwest has once more become an attractive destination for those seeking a better life. Free from the hustle-and-bustle of the Metropolises of Canada and the Northeast, the Midwest shall take in the huddled masses who wish for both freedom and some well-deserved peace and quiet."
 
 MWA_koch:0 "David Koch's Stabilization"
 MWA_koch_desc:0 "With the Hammons administration failing to preserve the Centrist character of our great Heartlander experiment, radical moves have been taken to protect our sacred way of life. Backed by the full apparatus of the State Department, David Koch has been elevated as our nation's new savior. Promising a radically Libertarian outlook, Koch now stands as the leader of a new American Experiment. Shall it succeed?"
 MWA_hire_private_security:0 "Expand Private Security"
 MWA_hire_private_security_desc:0 "Among our enlisted men there is a concerning lack of drive and focus. By outsourcing certain military matters to private firms, we can reap the rewards of the free market, ensuring the best of the best serve the national interest for the highest dollar. While some bemoan the 'Privatization' of our military, it is clear that battles are won with both bullets and dollars."
 MWA_extreme_deregulation:0 "Extreme Deregulation"
 MWA_extreme_deregulation_desc:0 "Buisness-killing Red Tape has long acted as a noose around the necks of honest Heartlander businessmen. The time has come to slash regulations, allowing the Free Market to regulate itself and preventing the innovation-stifling whims of Liberals and Communists from interfering with the Midwestern way of life. Under Koch, the best and the brightest will be allowed to flourish, free from the burden of overregulation."
 MWA_slash_taxes:0 "Slash Taxes"
 MWA_slash_taxes_desc:0 "Taxes have long suffocated countless Heartlanders. The time has come to cut taxes across the board, delivering relief to all true Americans, while allowing us to patch holes in our budget with generous private donations. The rich and poor alike shall bask in the glory of their bare minimum taxation as we seek to establish the Heartlands as a Libertarian paradise."
 MWA_vision_of_rand:0 "Vision of Rand"
 MWA_vision_of_rand_desc:0 "Ayn Rand's vision of a Libertarian society has been unfortunately ignored by those in the post-United States. Even with the failures of Government proven post-1987 proven, and a blank slate available, few were willing to seize the saddle of destiny and forge an Objectivist Utopia here in America. Thankfully, under President Koch this grave error has been undone, and the Randian spirit has been implemented on the national level, ensuring that the message of 'The Fountainhead' is not forgotten."
 MWA_promote_koch_media:0 "Promote Koch Media"
 MWA_promote_koch_media_desc:0 "Control of the media is vital for our Libertarian experiment's success. Koch, himself something of a recluse from the prying eyes of the media, has hired Conservative personality Dennis Prager to head up the new government's PR effort. With Prager's easy-to-digest lessons on the success of Libertarian policy, we shall educate the youth of the nation about the trappings of Statism, ensuring that the Libertarian experiment continues long after Koch has left this mortal plain."
 MWA_open_the_borders:0 "Open the Borders"
 MWA_open_the_borders_desc:0 "Cheap labour is key to ensuring the survival of our new national experiment. Desperate refugees fleeing from Socialist tyranny on the Coasts, and hard-working Mexicans seeking employment  shall be the new backbone of the Heartlander economy. While our Paleoconservative counterparts may scoff at the opening of the borders, we trust that this is the best way to keep an affordable labour market and prevent the formation of Unions."
 MWA_privatize_education:0 "Privatize Education"
 MWA_privatize_education_desc:0 "Bloated Public Education has dumbed down our children and instilled their young minds with treasonous anti-American creed. Communism may have killed the American Dream, but under Koch's watch, we can teach children the truth about the wicked evils of Communism and Welfarism. The vision of Koch shall be spread among the youth, thanks to generous contribution from the private sector."
 MWA_bribe_political_opposition:0 "Bribe Political Opposition"
 MWA_bribe_political_opposition_desc:0 "Within our territories lie those still continuing to oppose Koch's libertarian experiment. We cannot stoop to the level of the KGB and remove the Statist worms who continue to stand in our way - but perhaps there is another way to deal with them. Koch is a man with deep pockets, perhaps deep enough to pay off those who continue to oppose his rule. While those with conscience might refuse, we trust that our pocketbook can silence the most vocally opposed amongst us."
 MWA_the_free_market_solution:0 "Salvation by the Invisible Hand"
 MWA_the_free_market_solution_desc:0 "There exists no problem great enough not to be solved by the forces of a Free Market. The statist parasites have made their intentions clear, and instead of yielding to their innovation-strangling whims, we have decided to instead build our own paradise here in the Heartlands. Now, we have declared that in the Heartlands yes, you are entitled to the sweat of your own brow - we are a nation where great would no longer be constrained by the small."
 
 MWA_extensive_centralization:0 "Extensive Centralization"
 MWA_extensive_centralization_desc:0 "Hammons' failed experiment is the primary reason for the Anarchy experienced during the late 2000s. Now, the time has come to centralize power in [MWA.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], put down the roving bands that terrorize our countryside, and consolidate direct power under the President. Ending the era of Decentralization is long overdue - the disastrous consequences speaking for themselves."
 
 MWA_america_under_the_allmighty_dollar:0 "America, Saved by the Almighty Dollar"
 MWA_america_under_the_allmighty_dollar_desc:0 "While Communists have attempted to stamp out the spirit of the American Free Market, [MWA.GetLeader] has prevailed against all odds. The Heartlands, often considered to be the weakest of the American claimants, has come out on top, vanquishing our foes across the continent. With the Business Plot succeeding in America, the time has now come to begin rebuilding our shattered American way of life."
 MWA_charitable_reconstruction:0 "The Power of Charity"
 MWA_charitable_reconstruction_desc:0 "As the rich and powerful, it is our duty to utilize our wealth to better the lives of our fellow Americans. With much of the nation lying in ruins following Restoration, the need for philanthropy is stronger than ever. The leaders of the second American Experiment shall now move to utilize their deep pockets to pay for a new American way of life, ensuring that personal prowess can fill the gaps left by the old Welfare State."
 MWA_return_of_the_executives:0 "Return of the Executives"
 MWA_return_of_the_executives_desc:0 "Following the Great American Collapse, countless of America's best and brightest sought refuge with our Northern neighbors. While countless Americans dwelling in Canada have no will to return to the new United States, others have proven more than willing to return home following Communism's defeat. Let us reach a hand to the émigrés, and aid in the return of those willing to listen."
 MWA_american_prosperity:0 "New Spirit of Prosperity"
 MWA_american_prosperity_desc:0 "The President has instructed his allies in the business world to get to work on lowering prices across the board. While this may temporarily hurt their bottom lines, ensuring the people of this country want for nothing will greatly assist in restoring American Consumerism. We can assure the American people get the best deal on their goods and services, further encouraging consumer spending and allowing both sides to benefit."
 MWA_re_open_the_markets:0 "A New Leader in the Global Market"
 MWA_re_open_the_markets_desc:0 "With America having risen from the muck, profit levels are off the charts as our Capitalist experiment at last begins to flourish. The American Eagle, rising from the ash, is beginning to spread its wings once more. Although  we are adamant about neutrality during this period of reconstruction, the message is clear. The freedom-hating forces of Communism have been put on notice, and soon, the behemoth of American Capitalism shall once more unleash its fury."

 MWA_clinton:0 "President Clinton"
 MWA_clinton_desc:0 "As it appears, the Liberal tradition is not quide dead within the Heartlands. William Jefferson Clinton, one of the founders of the Union, has returned from self-imposed political exile to save the Democratic Establishment from irrelevance. Arguing for a Progressive but still Centrist approach to politics and a policy of Centralization in opposition to former President Hammons, William Clinton hopes to lead the Heartlands to ultimate salvation."

 heartlands.1.t:0 "Clark Speaks to the Nation"
 heartlands.1.d:0 "The nation is understandably in an uproar after the recent Military Coup in Denver. Across the aisle, furious denunciations of the General's actions have rang out, with many vowing even to violently oppose the new administration. However with a firm command of the nation's armed forces, any such violent resistance seems highly unlikely. Democrats have quietly supported this seizure of power, labeling Clark's actions as 'troubling but necessary', all while President Hammons issues a silent show of support to his mentor and predecessor. President Clark has recently spoken to the nation via a nationwide Television address, speaking at length about the concerns expressed by many. In his speech, he stated his regret that he was forced to override the Union's Democratic foundation, but stated that the whims of the Establishment Parties left him with no other choice than to take decisive action. Congress, for the time being, has had its duties suspended, with an advisory council of Generals and other Technocratic advisors helming the nation for the time being. Clark has promised that a return to full and complete Democracy would be underway in the time being, but many aren't holding their breath. While he did his best to assure the nation, many are still deeply skeptical about the prospect of Clark's return, especially Conservatives, who have worried about Clark's promises of extensive Social Liberalism."

 heartlands.2.t:0 "General Clark Speaks to Congress"
 heartlands.2.d:0 "Among the most prominent opposition to McChrystal's unprecedented overthrow of the Hammons administration lies with Democrats in Congress. While they certainly prefer Clark's avowed Social Liberalism to the Conservatism of Rodham or god forbid the Paleocons, a Military Junta is still far from their desired form of government. William Jefferson Clinton, along with others such as Gary Hartpence and former Vice President Mark Pryor have made their opposition to Clark's seizure of power clear. In hopes of smoothing over tensions with the now-shuddered Legislative branch, General Clark has met with key Democratic members of Congress in order to secure their support. Bob Kerrey, already swayed by Clark's promises, has been instrumental in scoring support among the Democratic caucus, and has led to much of the Democratic Party accepting their new advisory role alongside President Clark, despite his own distrust of the Party. Recognizing both the Democratic Party and Unity Party as key planks of support, Clark has signalled an openness to granting concessions, and the Democrats in turn have worked alongside Clark to undo the Decentralization agenda of Former President Hammons, which has become a point of mutual contention for both Democrats and Clark."

 heartlands.3.t:0 "Clean Air and Water Act Passes"
 heartlands.3.d:0 "Thanks to generous encouragement from the President, a bill to clean up our nation's skies and waterways has flown through the remains of Congress. This bill, which arrived on the President's desk today, is one that cracks down on some of the Heartland's worst polluters. Hard limits on the four major pollutants have been introduced across the totality of the nation, strictly limiting the carbon output of major factories. In addition, strict punishment for ecological damage caused by runoff from farming have been introduced. The Heartlands, as a primarily Agrarian nation dependent on various fertilizers, has had a major problem with agricultural runoff in rivers and streams. Thanks to Clark's actions, the effort to clean up our environment has been codified, with a Carbon Cap and Trade System also being introduced alongside the clean Air and Water bill. While some caution that this bill may make creating the requisite military industry for Reunification difficult, Clark remains unswayed and has formally joined the long string of world leaders recognizing the fragile state of Earth's ecosystem, utilizing his status as a de-facto dictator to introduce strict limits on pollutants and Greenhouse Gas Emissions."

 heartlands.4.t:0 "Gay Marriage Legalized"
 heartlands.4.d:0 "In a move celebrated by Democrats and Clark Loyalists alike, the President has formally declared the legalization of Homosexual Marriage within the Union of the Heartlands. This order, formally signed today in a grand ceremony attended by members of the LGBT community, has made the Heartlands one more nation in the Former United States to recognize Gay Marriage. This move, motivated both by Clark's staunchly Social Liberal stances, and as a way to ensure that the spouses of all enlisted men and women regardless of gender and sex are entitled to their due benefits, now seeks to allow all Heartlanders to marry regardless of assigned sex. While Social Conservatives have been in an uproar over the news, declaring it to be a slippery slope and an attack on Christianity in the Former United States, they have little leeway to stop Clark from implementing his agenda. Fortunately, polls have indicated widespread support for this move, even in typically Conservative areas, with Clark's military motivations playing a large role in the chipping away of the Heartland's latent homophobia. Already hundreds of same-sex couples are moving to marry under the new laws, with some LGBT Americans in neighboring states where Same Sex marriage remains illegal choosing to relocate to the Heartlands because of the new laws.

 heartlands.5.t:0 "New Healthcare Law Implemented"
 heartlands.5.d:0 "Healthcare remains a popular point of contention for many within the Union, and across the wider United States. The exact nature of healthcare remains spotty throughout what was once the USA, with the Heartlands standing out as a nation in which Healthcare has made little to no significant advances in the area since the days of Reagan. Clark, who himself stood out among his Centrist colleagues for his outspoken support of Universal Healthcare, long found his plans to introduce a system of Socialized Medicine stonewalled by Congress. Thankfully, Congress is no longer an issue, with the institution being de-facto shuttered ever since the coup, and the remains of Congress now unflinchingly loyal to the President's whims. Under Clark's orders, a new system of Canadian-style Universal Healthcare has been formally introduced, replacing the previous patchwork of independent Medicare systems used by only certain individual states, with many particularly Conservative areas having no Public options to speak of. Now, all Heartlanders, regardless of their enlisted status, have access to premium care - even if soldiers are entitled to additional advantages such as free dental and vision care. These benefits will hopefully roll out to all Heartlanders some time in the far future."

But now, Americans, with their mouths agape, have at last seen that the unlikelyest outcome, a unification via the Heartlands, has in fact become a reality. David has indeed defeated Goliath, slaying the forces of Communism, Socialism and GOP Republicanism, despite their seemingly superior numbers and industry. Now, President [ROOT.GetLeader] has taken the opportunity to speak to a divided nation - now a nation no longer divided by borders, but divided by ideology and class. Speaking from the bullet hole-ridden interior of the Oval Office, where Ronald Reagan once spoke of America's dissolution on that fateful day in 1987, [ROOT.GetLeader] has declared, a tone of triumph in every word, that the American Experiment has returned. The doubters have been proved wrong, and as we sweep decades of cobwebs and rat urine out of the abandoned husk of America's once-center of power, the people of this great nation can once more prosper, not as strangers divided by borders, but as Americans. From Sea to Shining Sea, the United States lives once more. From the ash, like a Phoenix, we have risen. While there is still much to be done before we can truly live up to the legacy of the old America, the American people have at last been able to look to their future with a certain cautious sense of hope."

 heartlands.7.t:0 "President Clark Releases Congress"
 heartlands.7.d:0 "With Wesley Clark being sworn in as the first President of the United States since Reagan, decisions have been made to restore the sanctity of former American institutions. Clark has formally abolished the Heartlander Congress, restoring in its stead the United States House of Representative and Senate. However these institutions have been changed significantly from their pre-Collapse incarnations, as any newly-elected Congressman can attest. Unlike the old Senate, Senators are no longer directly elected, with only one of a State's two Senators being elected - the other being appointed directly by the President. This move has been made by Clark to ensure the 'loyalty' of all Senators to the United States, and to solve what Clark viewed as part of the undoing of the original USA - the disorderly Congress more dedicated to their own betterment than the betterment of the nation. As well, in the House, 1/3rd of the seats have been set aside for apolitical military officials, officials who are almost guaranteed to skew towards President Clark politically. While the new Congress has been given a substantial measure of freedom, at the end of the day President Clark maintains final say on all matters of policy, with many accusing this new Congress of only working as a rubbers-stamp for Clark's expansive domestic agenda."

This moment was seen by many as the absolute zenith of the United States, and given the 20 years following the Moon Landing, it's hard to blame people for thinking so. Clark, himself fascinated by all manner of next-level military technology, has prodded officials within the military to start thinking beyond the limits of traditional scientific endeavors. Clark, often speaking about the need to break beyond 'Light Speed', has now ordered the investment of millions in the pursuit of technology to move beyond light speed, stating that 'I still believe in e=mc², but I can't believe that in all of human history, we'll never ever be able to go beyond the speed of light to reach where we want to go', further elaborating that 'I've argued with physicists about it, I've argued with best friends about it. I just have to believe it. It's my only faith-based initiative'. Physicists have doubted the President's claim, throwing cold water on the possibility of his grandiose vision. However, with a windfall of money going into NASA's coffers, most within the scientific community are content with allowing Clark to dream, so long as the spigot is kept open."
