 MWA_clarks_return:0 "Clark's Return"
 MWA_clarks_return_desc:0 "The bitter failure of the Centrist Establishment has forced the hand of General Clark. With Denver rendered useless by constant deadlock, it has been decided that only the steady hand of former President Wesley J. Clark, who promises to end the political stalemate and at last restore America to its former glory. The question is, does Clark have the means to do so?"
 MWA_silence_establishment_bickering:0 "Silence Establishment Bickering"
 MWA_silence_establishment_bickering_desc:0 "The divided political scene of our great nation was indeed the driving force behind General Clark's decision. The countless establishment politicians who have never experienced the glory of military service have no right to dictate the running of the Heartlands. Only an iron fist and an iron will will protect ourselves from the trappings of political deadlock."
 MWA_unrepentant_militarism:0 "Unrepentant Militarism"
 MWA_unrepentant_militarism_desc:0 "America's restoration is set to be no easy task. Our nation's own diminutive stature in comparison to the Commonwealth and the UAPR has come as a great disadvantage to us. If we are to secure victory on the great American battlefield, then we must instill a sense of martial discipline within the minds and the bodies of our populace. Under the great American Napoleon, we shall secure the restoration of our beloved United States, and at last banish weakness off the face of our continent."
 MWA_civilian_corps:0 "New Civilian Corps"
 MWA_civilian_corps_desc:0 "There remain some within our nation who are either incapable or unwilling to devote themselves to a life in the Military, these people, despite their incapability of serving the Heartlands on the battlefield, still have a valuable part to play in the restoration of the United States. Under Clark's guidance, we shall restore the AmeriCorps, allowing those who cannot serve to contribute to the rebirth of our great American Experiment."
 MWA_gay_marrige:0 "Legalize Gay Marriage"
 MWA_gay_marrige_desc:0 "General Clark has observed that under his command lie countless proud Americans from countless stripes of life. Among those who proudly serve our country are Homosexuals who still cannot marry, leaving their significant others without compensation in the event of their death. This cannot stand. Under Clark's iron fist, Gay Marriage shall be at last legalized within the Heartlands."
 MWA_liberal_social_policy:0 "Liberal Social Policy"
 MWA_liberal_social_policy_desc:0 "On the battlefield, it doesn't matter the colour of one's skin nor the alignment of their sexuality. Those who have been so brave as to stand for the new America come from countless walks of life - and Clark will not tolerate those who dare to disparage any proud American patriot. Our policy shall be one of unabashed Social Liberalism, protecting men and women both enlisted and otherwise. A strict code of anti-Racism shall be adopted, and the rights to Abortion will be protected."
 MWA_clean_air_and_water:0 "Clean Air and Water"
 MWA_clean_air_and_water_desc:0 "The changing climate has become a fact of plain observation to most within the world, however here in the Heartlands some have been so bold as to deny the existence of our shifting ecosystem. Clark, recognizing the health and welfare of our populace as paramount, has enacted strict regulation to contain airborne and waterborne pollutants, and prepare the Heartlands for a climate-friendly future."
 MWA_the_new_eisenhower:0 "In the Footsteps of Great Men"
 MWA_the_new_eisenhower_desc:0 "As the Heartlands looks to their uniform-clad savior, General-turned-President Clark has utilized his prowess to inspire a new generation of true Americans. With an Eisenhowerian demeanor and a style of leadership born from the teachings of Napoleon himself, Wesley Clark is determined to shape America in his image... or die trying."
 MWA_new_american_patriotism:0 "New American Patriotism"
 MWA_new_american_patriotism_desc:0 "After 1987 many considered the concept of 'America' to be lost to the dust of Reaganism. Yet now, a new Patriotism has been born by General Clark's efforts - one which has seen the values of the Stars and Stripes reborn here in the Heartlands after decades of decay. While Separatists may wince at this cultural shift, it has become clear that the only way forward is to restore the mighty United States."
 MWA_new_healthcare_system:0 "Public Healthcare System"
 MWA_new_healthcare_system_desc:0 "If we are to restore the American Experiment built by our founding fathers, we must realize the gravitas of our national situation. Within the Heartlands, countless languish without sufficient access to healthcare. The access to such vital care has become a luxury to many. This cannot stand. At once, we must create a single-payer healthcare system within our new United States."
 MWA_clarks_america:0 "Clark's American Restoration"
 MWA_clarks_america_desc:0 "At long last, the armies of the Heartlands have broken through the gates of Olympus. While some have called the General mad for daring to dream, it seems that Denver's gamble has paid off in the end. The Stars and Stripes once more wave proudly from Sea to Shining Sea. Yet there is much work to be done if we are to truly restore the American Dream. Let us begin."
 MWA_reaching_light_speed:0 "Reaching Light Speed"
 MWA_reaching_light_speed_desc:0 "One oft-forgotten yet still tragic consequence of the Soviet Union's victory in the Cold War was the abandonment of global space exploration. With NASA proudly being restored following Reunification, President Clark has begun an extensive program to help conquer the frontiers of tomorrow. We must push ourselves to conquer the stars; light-speed technology shall soon be within our grasp."
 MWA_loyal_congress:0 "Subordinate Congress"
 MWA_loyal_congress_desc:0 "With the halls of power in new Washington being staffed by men in uniform, the purpose of Congress has seemed exhausted to many. However Clark fancies himself as no dictator, despite the complaints of countless detractors. The time has come to release the Military's hold on civilian government - so long as they prove willing to do what's best for America."
 MWA_military_role_in_reconstruction:0 "AmeriCorp Reconstruction"
 MWA_military_role_in_reconstruction_desc:0 "America has been left in ruins ever since the war of reclamation. With President Clark having restored the AmeriCorps before the Great War, we already have a hearty Civilian Corps dedicated to assisting the military in matters of reconstruction. Now, we can expand these efforts across the new United States, and slowly yet surely restore America to its pre-1987 glory."
 MWA_new_internationalism:0 "Revive the Internationalist Crusade"
 MWA_new_internationalism_desc:0 "The cause of Capitalism, to many, was vanquished unquestionably after the disaster of 1987. Under Clark's guide, we have undoubtedly proven them wrong. And yet still, those who deny the need for America to reclaim its place on the World Stage exist. We must prove these doubters wrong, and restore the pride and prowess that the USA once enjoyed. Onward, to Europe!"
 
 MWA_paleocons:0 "Paleoconservative Recovery"
 MWA_paleocons_desc:0 "Few would have expected the Paleoconservative crusade of Buchanan and Tancredo to be victorious on the stage of Heartlander politics. Now, this burgeoning movement, ready to reject the decades of past failures, has stepped up to usher in an era of unabashed Conservatism across the American Midwest. While some may scoff at the President's efforts, [MWA.GetLeader] will not allow the jeers of Liberals and Communists distract him from his efforts to restore the American Dream."
 MWA_revive_the_vision_of_ashbrook:0 "Rehabilitate Ashbrook"
 MWA_revive_the_vision_of_ashbrook_desc:0 "A young Pat Buchanan first got his political career started in John Ashbrook's White House. While the Liberal media has been ever eager to vilify Ashbrook in the aftermath of the Spanish affair, the facts remain that Ashbrook was a true paragon of Conservative values in stark contrast to the failed Liberalism of Reagan and Bush. The time has come to set the record straight."
 MWA_a_second_conservative_revolution:0 "A True Conservative Revolution"
 MWA_a_second_conservative_revolution_desc:0 "Despite the pitiful attempts of 'Moderates' such as Rodham, the fact remains that the New Right is the only movement with the legitimacy to represent the Conservative movement in the Heartlands. Buchanan, himself an exile from the watered-down Conservatism of the Bush era, is determined to bring his fervently isolationist vision to the forefront of Heartlander politics - icing out any who may stand in his way."
 MWA_heartland_values:0 "Strict Social Conservatism"
 MWA_heartland_values_desc:0 "While Liberals and Communists may be eager to preach the gospel of Homosexuality and Abortion instead of the irrefutable word of our one lord God, President Buchanan knows well enough that the good God-fearing people of the Heartlands won't be fooled by such drivel. We shall aim to protect our Midwestern family values against all those who seek to erode the Nuclear Family in the name of 'Progress' and 'Tolerance'."
 MWA_new_nativism:0 "New Nativism"
 MWA_new_nativism_desc:0 "America's values are under attack. Such is clear to anybody who has been paying attention to the last 20 years. While the Communists in Philadelphia and Los Angeles attempt to destroy the American Way of Life, and do-nothing politicians in Atlanta stand by, President Buchanan is eager to protect American heritage. The time has come to reach back, restore the spirit of the Know-Nothings."
 MWA_appeal_to_patriotic_leftists:0 "Appeal to Patriotic Leftists"
 MWA_appeal_to_patriotic_leftists_desc:0 "While this stance may come off as confusing to many within our own camp, President Buchanan realizes that not all on the other side of the spectrum are an entirely lost cause. Working with figures such as Lenora Fulani, Buchanan shall work to create a formidable alliance with those on the left, including the many Trade Unions which call the Heartlands Home."
 MWA_media_empire:0 "A Media Empire"
 MWA_media_empire_desc:0 "Controlling the narrative is key to maintaining political power in this day and age. The rise of Cable Television and Talk Radio has provided Conservatism with a fertile new ground for expanding grassroots support. Utilizing our connections within the Radio and Television scene, the Paleoconservative movement shall aim to shape the narrative through friendly broadcasts and coverage, all while buying out stations critical to our message."
 MWA_paleocon_america:0 "Ashbrook Avenged"
 MWA_paleocon_america_desc:0 "At last the Communists, Liberals and false Conservatives have been driven from the face of the United States. While some had been content in our own self-imposed isolation, Buchanan and his Paleoconservative movement have pulled off the impossible, bringing back the United States and restoring the legacy of President Ashbrook. Our forefathers would be proud of us."
 MWA_victory_in_the_culture_war:0 "Victory in the Culture War"
 MWA_victory_in_the_culture_war_desc:0 "At last, our struggle against Homosexuality, Abortion and Anti-Christian Values has been won by the iron fist of the Paleoconservative movement. With Congress under the President's control, we can at last codify our efforts, ensuring that America remains a morally upstanding nation worthy of God's love. No longer shall 'Liberals' and Communists be able to use the cause of sinners as a cudgel against our movement."
 MWA_liquidate_communism:0 "Liquidate Communism"
 MWA_liquidate_communism_desc:0 "So much of our nation spent decades languishing under the tyranny of Communists, Socialist and Liberal forces. With Conservatism at last conquering the halls of power in Washington, we can at last mobilize our forces to at last stamp out the Hammer and Sickle. The FBI and the New CIA shall be dispatched to destroy any remains of the Communist Jackboot on our soil, and ensure that any form of Communism, be it Marxism or Liberalism, is never allowed to flourish on American soil."
 MWA_strict_isolationism:0 "Strict Isolationism"
 MWA_strict_isolationism_desc:0 "Our great work in securing the American continent has been finished. While we detest the wicked forces of Communism across the mighty Atlantic, it is no longer America's place to play World Police. For too long Conservative paragons such as Ashbrook and false Communistic Liberal agents such as Rumsfeld have been caught up in Interventionism's siren call. No longer."
 MWA_a_republic_not_an_empire:0 "A Republic, Not An Empire"
 MWA_a_republic_not_an_empire_desc:0 "The America First policy has finally proved its worth. As the rest of the World remains locked in bitter ideological conflict, America focuses on rebuilding the shattered streets and lives, repairing our nation after the devastation incurred during the Reclamation War. While Buchanan may no longer be running the show, his vision has prevailed, and at long last, Paleoconservativism has proven its worth to even the most seditious of Liberals."
 
 MWA_miller:0 "Miller's Presidency"
 MWA_miller_desc:0 "By far the most unlikely player on the political scene has stepped up in the Heartland's hour of need. Merlin Miller, backed by his infamous 'Eagles' Paramilitary, has secured power in the Union of the Heartlands, promising a crackdown on all Communists and non-Christians within our territory. While we appreciate Buchanan's contributions, saving America is a job for President Miller alone."
 MWA_reach_out_to_tanceredo:0 "Reach out to Tancredo"
 MWA_reach_out_to_tanceredo_desc:0 "Speaker Tancredo was the most critical supporter of the House's coup against Udall. While Tancredo shares Miller's virulent hatred of immigrants, he has also expressed skepticism towards the more 'Radical' portions of Miller's agenda. Facilitating a meeting with friendly representatives such as Representative Gosar, we shall secure the Speaker's loyalty - which will further aid in efforts to push through Miller's agenda."
 MWA_protect_our_european_american_heritage:0 "Protect our Euro-American Heritage"
 MWA_protect_our_european_american_heritage_desc:9 "The forces of Globalism have long sought to dilute America's racial identity with immigration and interracial marriage. While we have no desire to formally illegalize such practices, our stance must be made clear - miscegenation is a threat to the United States - any while we hold no ill will towards minorities, we must protect America's white majority. We are a Party for White Americans."
 MWA_a_new_hollywood:0 "Rebuild Hollywood"
 MWA_a_new_hollywood_desc:0 "Even before its takeover by Communist forces, Hollywood was polluted by Zionist forces attempting to brainwash Americans into doing their bidding. Miller, himself a prolific filmmaker, has sought to recapture control of the media, creating a booming new film industry here in the Heartlands, one which will produce proud pro-American narratives instead of churning out anti-American dreck."
 MWA_heartland_shield_against_globalism:0 "A Shield Against Globalism"
 MWA_heartland_shield_against_globalism_desc:0 "The Soviet Union has long used their dominance over global affairs as an excuse to force their wicked Zionist creed down the throats of honest folk. The time has come to stand against these efforts to corrupt American identity. The Heartlands is America's shield against Globalism, proudly fending off the UAPR's wicked Bolshevik creed and the false Conservatism of Atlanta."
 MWA_legacy_of_the_lone_eagle:0 "Rehabilitate the Lone Eagle"
 MWA_legacy_of_the_lone_eagle_desc:0 "Charles Lindbergh was a great American Patriot unfairly vilified by the Zionist media due to his unflinching dedication to peace. The Lone Eagle has long been a symbol of Miller's movement, and with our newfound control over the Media, we can finally set the record straight about this brave American hero."
 MWA_empower_the_eagles:0 "Let Loose the Eagles"
 MWA_empower_the_eagles_desc:0 "President Miller's feared Paramilitary, the Eagles, is the few lines between the people of the Heartlands and utter bedlam. These heroes shall be empowered to dispense justice at Miller's command, dealing with malcontents and providing a visible line of defense against the forces of Communism and Liberalism."
 MWA_millers_america:0 "Miller's America"
 MWA_millers_america_desc:0 "At long last, the forces of Abortion, Homsexuality, Liberalism, Race-Mixing and Communism have been destroyed by President Miller's righteous Iron Fist. No more shall America be terrorized by Bolshevik-Zionist regimes. From now on, America shall be reconstructed along the lines of strength and patriotism."
 MWA_protect_american_race:0 "Protect the American Race"
 MWA_protect_american_race_desc:0 "Americans have been under attack from sinister forces for more than two decades. From the onset of the Civil Rights movement, insidious forces have conspired to exterminate the White Race on American Soil. Thankfully, President Miller has taken decisive action to stop the destruction of our heritage, protecting our heritage and tradition against the forces of Race Communism which seek to destroy our way of life."
 MWA_strike_centers_of_finance:0 "Strike the Centers of Finance"
 MWA_strike_centers_of_finance_desc:0 "President Miller is no one to hate the Jewish race. However he cannot accept favoritism granted to those within the Hebrew Tribes by members of financial and cultural institutions. Miller's comprehensive purge of the banks shall be the first step in combatting Zionist influence in the new United States."
 MWA_a_return_to_true_americanism:0 "A Return to Tradition"
 MWA_a_return_to_true_americanism_desc:0 "Miller's America has at last undone the damage done by decades of Communism and Liberalism. While some within the Paleoconservative movement are willing to sit on their hands as Communism destroys the forces of Christianity and Tradition across the globe, Miller knows better than to sit idly by while Bolshevism festers. Communism must be annihilated, both at home, and abroad."
 MWA_seal_our_borders:0 "Seal Our Borders"
 MWA_seal_our_borders_desc:0 "America's borders have remained porous ever since the Great Collapse, allowing the spawn of foreign hordes to recklessly invade our soil. The time has come at last to shut our borders to these anti-American agitators, ensuring once and for all that America is safe from the lingering taint of foreigners."
 MWA_a_christian_heartlands:0 "A Christian Heartlands"
 MWA_a_christian_heartlands_desc:0 "While the Marx-worshiping Atheists in the Liberal Communist movement wish to tear down the Cross and continue the lie of 'Separation of Church and State', the wise leadership of [MWA.GetLeader] will not tolerate those who spread such insidious anti-Christian creed within our borders. This is God's country. America is a Christian Nation."
 MWA_empower_the_police:0 "Support the Police"
 MWA_empower_the_police_desc:0 "The state of veritable Anarchy in the Heartlands has been caused by limp-wristed politicians afraid to punish criminals who continue to harass honest folk. The time has come to empower our boys in blue to take care of business, at last sidelining the pitiful whining of those who care more about the rights of criminals than the rights of everyday Americans."
 
 MWA_buffet:0 "Warren Buffet's Rise"
 MWA_buffet_desc:0 "The failure of both the Central Government and the Libertarian experiment of Koch has led to the rise of a new form of Liberalism in the Heartlands. While decried by some as a new 'Dictatorship', Buffet's new American experiment seeks to safeguard our nation's prosperity while also balancing it with meeting the needs of the people."
 MWA_tax_the_rich:0 "Tax the Rich"
 MWA_tax_the_rich_desc:0 "While some would naturally expect Buffet, the richest man in the Heartlands to be a fervent opponent of taxation on the rich, the President is quite the opposite, instead favouring a new taxation programme which would force the rich to pay their fair share."
 MWA_collaborate_with_democrats:0 "Collaborate with the Democrats"
 MWA_collaborate_with_democrats_desc:0 "Working with allies such as William Clinton, President Buffet has empowered the Democratic Party to represent all Heartlanders, in stark opposition to weak-willed Centrists and the failed regressive policies of the Conservatives. Only under the guise of figures such as Clinton and Hartpence shall our great nation thrive."
 MWA_encourage_consumerism:0 "Encourage Consumerism"
 MWA_encourage_consumerism_desc:0 "Much of the economic downturn has been caused by a lack of consumer confidence in the economy. By restoring consumer confidence in the economy, we can effectively encourage spending and bring the Heartlands economy back into the forefront."
 MWA_improve_workers_rights:0 "Improve Worker's Rights"
 MWA_improve_workers_rights_desc:0 "The anarchic government of the Heartlands before Buffet's seizure of power has allowed for the rights of Workers in our territory to be veritably trampled. Buffet, while typically not on the best terms with the Union, realizes the needs for strong workers rights, allowing all to both prosper and enjoy safe working conditions."
 MWA_public_health_care:0 "Public Health Care System"
 MWA_public_health_care_desc:0 "Liberals like Clinton have long proposed a new Health Care system to replace our existing private system. However it is apparent that these proposals don't go nearly far enough. President Buffet has made the decision to implement a Canadian-style Public Healthcare system which will allow all citizens to access high-quality care regardless of income."
 MWA_release_congress:0 "Release Congress"
 MWA_release_congress_desc:0 "Although President Buffet may have been brought to power via a coup, the President does not desire the erosion of our Democratic institutions. The time has come to restore the power of Congress, and at last bring Free and Fair elections back to the Union of the Heartlands."
 MWA_encourage_philantropy:0 "Encourage Philanthropy"
 MWA_encourage_philantropy_desc:0 "The spirit of charity is vital for the reconstruction of the American Dream. Buffet, himself a contributor to countless charitable endeavors, seeks to ensure that the rich contribute to the betterment of their fellow citizens. "
 MWA_a_balanced_economy:0 "A Balanced Economy"
 MWA_a_balanced_economy_desc:0 "Unregulated Capitalism has led to complete disaster across countless post-American nations. Buffet, himself a man of great wealth, recognizes that the pursuit of profit is no excuse for the trampling of human rights and dignity. Strict regulation, alongside a formidable Welfare State, will ensure that the Heartlands thrive under a mixed Keynesian economy."
 MWA_encourage_settlement:0 "Attract Skilled Immigration"
 MWA_encourage_settlement_desc:0 "For too long talent has skipped over the Heartlands in favour of Canada or the Northeast. Under Buffet's rule, the Midwest has once more become an attractive destination for those seeking a better life. Free from the hustle-and-bustle of the Metropolises of Canada and the Northeast, the Midwest shall take in the huddled masses who wish for both freedom and some well-deserved peace and quiet."
 
 MWA_koch:0 "David Koch's Stabilization"
 MWA_koch_desc:0 "With the Hammons administration failing to preserve the Centrist character of our great Heartlander experiment, radical moves have been taken to protect our sacred way of life. Backed by the full apparatus of the State Department, David Koch has been elevated as our nation's new savior. Promising a radically Libertarian outlook, Koch now stands as the leader of a new American Experiment. Shall it succeed?"
 MWA_hire_private_security:0 "Expand Private Security"
 MWA_hire_private_security_desc:0 "Among our enlisted men there is a concerning lack of drive and focus. By outsourcing certain military matters to private firms, we can reap the rewards of the free market, ensuring the best of the best serve the national interest for the highest dollar. While some bemoan the 'Privatization' of our military, it is clear that battles are won with both bullets and dollars."
 MWA_extreme_deregulation:0 "Extreme Deregulation"
 MWA_extreme_deregulation_desc:0 "Buisness-killing Red Tape has long acted as a noose around the necks of honest Heartlander businessmen. The time has come to slash regulations, allowing the Free Market to regulate itself and preventing the innovation-stifling whims of Liberals and Communists from interfering with the Midwestern way of life. Under Koch, the best and the brightest will be allowed to flourish, free from the burden of overregulation."
 MWA_slash_taxes:0 "Slash Taxes"
 MWA_slash_taxes_desc:0 "Taxes have long suffocated countless Heartlanders. The time has come to cut taxes across the board, delivering relief to all true Americans, while allowing us to patch holes in our budget with generous private donations. The rich and poor alike shall bask in the glory of their bare minimum taxation as we seek to establish the Heartlands as a Libertarian paradise."
 MWA_vision_of_rand:0 "Vision of Rand"
 MWA_vision_of_rand_desc:0 "Ayn Rand's vision of a Libertarian society has been unfortunately ignored by those in the post-United States. Even with the failures of Government proven post-1987 proven, and a blank slate available, few were willing to seize the saddle of destiny and forge an Objectivist Utopia here in America. Thankfully, under President Koch this grave error has been undone, and the Randian spirit has been implemented on the national level, ensuring that the message of 'The Fountainhead' is not forgotten."
 MWA_promote_koch_media:0 "Promote Koch Media"
 MWA_promote_koch_media_desc:0 "Control of the media is vital for our Libertarian experiment's success. Koch, himself something of a recluse from the prying eyes of the media, has hired Conservative personality Dennis Prager to head up the new government's PR effort. With Prager's easy-to-digest lessons on the success of Libertarian policy, we shall educate the youth of the nation about the trappings of Statism, ensuring that the Libertarian experiment continues long after Koch has left this mortal plain."
 MWA_open_the_borders:0 "Open the Borders"
 MWA_open_the_borders_desc:0 "Cheap labour is key to ensuring the survival of our new national experiment. Desperate refugees fleeing from Socialist tyranny on the Coasts, and hard-working Mexicans seeking employment  shall be the new backbone of the Heartlander economy. While our Paleoconservative counterparts may scoff at the opening of the borders, we trust that this is the best way to keep an affordable labour market and prevent the formation of Unions."
 MWA_privatize_education:0 "Privatize Education"
 MWA_privatize_education_desc:0 "Bloated Public Education has dumbed down our children and instilled their young minds with treasonous anti-American creed. Communism may have killed the American Dream, but under Koch's watch, we can teach children the truth about the wicked evils of Communism and Welfarism. The vision of Koch shall be spread among the youth, thanks to generous contribution from the private sector."
 MWA_bribe_political_opposition:0 "Bribe Political Opposition"
 MWA_bribe_political_opposition_desc:0 "Within our territories lie those still continuing to oppose Koch's libertarian experiment. We cannot stoop to the level of the KGB and remove the Statist worms who continue to stand in our way - but perhaps there is another way to deal with them. Koch is a man with deep pockets, perhaps deep enough to pay off those who continue to oppose his rule. While those with conscience might refuse, we trust that our pocketbook can silence the most vocally opposed amongst us."
 MWA_the_free_market_solution:0 "Salvation by the Invisible Hand"
 MWA_the_free_market_solution_desc:0 "There exists no problem great enough not to be solved by the forces of a Free Market. The statist parasites have made their intentions clear, and instead of yielding to their innovation-strangling whims, we have decided to instead build our own paradise here in the Heartlands. Now, we have declared that in the Heartlands yes, you are entitled to the sweat of your own brow - we are a nation where great would no longer be constrained by the small."
 
 MWA_extensive_centralization:0 "Extensive Centralization"
 MWA_extensive_centralization_desc:0 "Hammons' failed experiment is the primary reason for the Anarchy experienced during the late 2000s. Now, the time has come to centralize power in [MWA.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], put down the roving bands that terrorize our countryside, and consolidate direct power under the President. Ending the era of Decentralization is long overdue - the disastrous consequences speaking for themselves."
 
 MWA_america_under_the_allmighty_dollar:0 "America, Saved by the Almighty Dollar"
 MWA_america_under_the_allmighty_dollar_desc:0 "While Communists have attempted to stamp out the spirit of the American Free Market, [MWA.GetLeader] has prevailed against all odds. The Heartlands, often considered to be the weakest of the American claimants, has come out on top, vanquishing our foes across the continent. With the Business Plot succeeding in America, the time has now come to begin rebuilding our shattered American way of life."
 MWA_charitable_reconstruction:0 "The Power of Charity"
 MWA_charitable_reconstruction_desc:0 "As the rich and powerful, it is our duty to utilize our wealth to better the lives of our fellow Americans. With much of the nation lying in ruins following Restoration, the need for philanthropy is stronger than ever. The leaders of the second American Experiment shall now move to utilize their deep pockets to pay for a new American way of life, ensuring that personal prowess can fill the gaps left by the old Welfare State."
 MWA_return_of_the_executives:0 "Return of the Executives"
 MWA_return_of_the_executives_desc:0 "Following the Great American Collapse, countless of America's best and brightest sought refuge with our Northern neighbors. While countless Americans dwelling in Canada have no will to return to the new United States, others have proven more than willing to return home following Communism's defeat. Let us reach a hand to the émigrés, and aid in the return of those willing to listen."
 MWA_american_prosperity:0 "New Spirit of Prosperity"
 MWA_american_prosperity_desc:0 "The President has instructed his allies in the business world to get to work on lowering prices across the board. While this may temporarily hurt their bottom lines, ensuring the people of this country want for nothing will greatly assist in restoring American Consumerism. We can assure the American people get the best deal on their goods and services, further encouraging consumer spending and allowing both sides to benefit."
 MWA_re_open_the_markets:0 "A New Leader in the Global Market"
 MWA_re_open_the_markets_desc:0 "With America having risen from the muck, profit levels are off the charts as our Capitalist experiment at last begins to flourish. The American Eagle, rising from the ash, is beginning to spread its wings once more. Although  we are adamant about neutrality during this period of reconstruction, the message is clear. The freedom-hating forces of Communism have been put on notice, and soon, the behemoth of American Capitalism shall once more unleash its fury."

 MWA_clinton:0 "President Clinton"
 MWA_clinton_desc:0 "As it appears, the Liberal tradition is not quide dead within the Heartlands. William Jefferson Clinton, one of the founders of the Union, has returned from self-imposed political exile to save the Democratic Establishment from irrelevance. Arguing for a Progressive but still Centrist approach to politics and a policy of Centralization in opposition to former President Hammons, William Clinton hopes to lead the Heartlands to ultimate salvation."
 MWA_the_third_way:0 "The Third Way"
 MWA_the_third_way_desc:0 "Based on figures such as Bob Rae in Canada and David Owen in the United Kingdom, President Clinton has begun formulating an ideology known by many as the 'Third Way'. This moderate form of Liberalism aims to retreat from the traditional Welfare State, synthesising both traditional Social Democratic policies with Center-Right Economic policies. In an America torn apart by extremism, this 'Third Way' shall help ensure that the forces of Liberalism survive the tests of time, and firmly reject any notion of radicalism within our territory."
 MWA_invest_in_the_intranet:0 "Invest in the Intranet"
 MWA_invest_in_the_intranet_desc:0 "Under the advice of 'Atari Democrats' such as Gary Hartpence within the Clinton cabinet, extensive investment into the Heartland's Intranet grid has been greenlit. Efforts to centralize our networks and bring more Heartlanders online shall become a backbone of Clinton's administration, as this elder statesmen helps to advance the Union into the future."
 MWA_healthcare_reform_plan:0 "Healthcare Reform Plan"
 MWA_healthcare_reform_plan_desc:0 "Unlike the Commonwealth or the UAPR, the Heartlands has no state-funded Healthcare policy in place. While we agree strongly with their refusal of Socialized medicine, the sorry state of healthcare in the Heartlands is a cause of serious concern for the President.

 midwest.2.t:0 "Hammons' Approval Ratings Continue To Plummet"
 midwest.2.d:0 "The incidents in Wichita have left President Hammons with nowhere to hide, and the news media has jumped on the attempt to scrutinize him and his administration. His lack of experience and General Clark's perceived nepotism in uplifting Hammons to higher and higher staff positions have all coalesced in scathing piece after scathing piece from Denver in Colorado to Pierre in South Dakota. His approval ratings now lie at 35% by the most generous estimates, and by the least generous estimate, 14.3%. The Unity Party has scrambled to secure the state apparatus and remove Hammons' control from the military and civil service, which they have consistently controlled within the Coalition, but already, the Democrats and Republicans have made efforts to exploit the weakness of Hammons' administration."
 midwest.2.o1:0 "The dream of unity is failing..."
 midwest.3.t:0 "Democratic Elite Seek Removal"
 midwest.3.d:0 "The Democratic Coalition is an impressive political machine, having continuously kept a hand on the rudder for years. However, political control over the government has done little to avert the continued decline of central authority over the country. In light of the increasing uncertainty in the former United States, disgruntlement has risen, particularly within the Democratic Party with Bill Clinton, a founding father of the Union and member of the Democratic Coalition stating that ‘it is regrettable that our country continues to languish in instability.’ in a recent interview with the Denver Post. While he rejected any notion that the Democratic Party were reconsidering their support for President Hammons, the flurry of meetings held within the Democratic party leadership lately seems to indicate that more is afoot. Behind closed doors, to the ignorance of the outside world, Bill Clinton and the leadership decided that Hammons had to go, and soon. Two avenues were discussed: infiltrating the administration and undermining Hammons from within, or allying with former president Wesley Clark and challenging Hammons from without. Ultimately, the party decided to..."
 midwest.3.o1:0 "Infiltrate the administration."
 midwest.3.o2:0 "Seek an ally in Wesley Clark."
 midwest.4.t:0 "Hammons Grows Suspicious"
 midwest.4.d:0 "The recent meetings held by the Democratic leadership could not have gone unnoticed indefinitely. In light of the recent Denver Post interview, President Bill Hammons brought up his worries to Vice President Mark Pryor, asking if it could really be true that the Democrats were looking to unseat him. Pryor initially attempted to reassure the President, but the President refused to be budged, soon after bringing up that he wanted an investigation, naturally hushed, to preserve the unity of the Democratic Coalition and to stop whatever schemers might be found. Hammons suggested having former President Clark lead the investigation, to which Pryor proposed himself instead, given his extensive ties with the government apparatus. Either option had possibilities, as Clark had a great deal of respect amongst many Midwesterners, while Pryor’s ties with the government would allow him to easily discover any and all potential infiltrators."
 midwest.4.o1:0 "Pryor will conduct the investigation!"
 midwest.4.o2:0 "President Clark will find out."
 midwest.5.t:0 "Investigation Details Republican Plot"
 midwest.5.d:0 "The investigation only lasted a short while. Merely days after President Bill Hammons asked Vice President Mark Pryor to investigate the rumours of government infiltration, a thick report laid on his desk, detailing an extensive plot by the Republican members of the coalition to undermine his presidency, with the trail leading into the Republican leadership. According to the document, the Republicans were planning on first infiltrating the Heartlander government, and once they had secured sufficiently powerful positions, they’d simply invite in the Armed Forces of the American Republic in to ‘restore order’ in the country. Pryor’s solution was simple: Expel the Republicans from government and let them answer to the people for their treason. Hammons was apprehensive about it, hadn’t the Democratic Party been holding meetings lately, and told Pryor that he’d think it through."
 midwest.5.o1:0 "Really? The Republicans?"
 midwest.6.t:0 "Hammons Calls Pryor"
 midwest.6.d:0 "A few days after receiving the report, Bill Hammons gave his vice president a phone call. Mark Pryor’s hopes that his recommendations would be followed to the letter were quickly dashed, as the President instead wanted to press Pryor on the concerns of his: The Democratic Party. Hammons was aware of Pryor’s ties and wondered if there may have been more afoul than what he knew of. Pryor was well prepared for the call, however, and handily deflected each one of the President’s worries, reassuring him that the Democratic Party had merely worried on their own about the Republican subterfuge, and been more than cooperative towards the investigation, as the report clearly showed. His answer was still clear, the Republicans had to go, lest they destroy all that the Democratic Coalition had worked for. When the phone call ended, Hammons sat in his office, unsure of the right path forward, for just a little moment, before making his decision."
 midwest.6.o1:0 "No, he seems to be right."
 midwest.7.t:0 "Republicans Purged From Coalition"
 midwest.7.d:0 "In the light of the results of the investigation, President Bill Hammons was quick to act. The day after his fateful phone call with Vice President Mark Pryor, he summoned the Republican leadership to his offices. The Republicans, unaware of what had been going on, went to the meeting wondering if it was going to be about the upcoming presidential elections. Instead, however, President Hammons sat them down and presented them with the large report by Pryor, hurling accusation after accusation at the bewildered Republican leadership, before telling them that he had no choice but to expel them from the Coalition for their treachery, and that the report was already making its way to the press as they spoke. The Republicans, realising that they could do little to assuage the outraged President, bowed their heads in resignation and departed from the office. The decision was met with outrage among the people, with the report being denounced as a fraud by not just Republicans but independents and media publications too, who are pointing to multiple holes in the report. The Democratic Coalition has been shaken, and nobody is more aware of this than Bill Hammons."

 midwest.8.t:0 "Democratic Coalition Collapses"
 midwest.8.d:0 "The political chaos gripping the country has developed further, as the one fixture of stability in the Union of the Heartlands too, has been smashed. The Democratic Coalition, long a powerful player in the country, has seen both its Democratic and Republican wings depart the party as scandal after scandal continues to rock it. Nowhere is this felt more than the approval ratings of President Bill Hammons himself, who has seen his support plummet to levels comparable to the late President Ronald Reagan. As the final nails are put in the coffin of the Democratic Coalition, so seems it that Hammons' chances of reelection are growing ever slimmer."
 midwest.8.o1:0 "Oh God..."
 midwest.9.t:0 "Republicans Defect To Rodham"
 midwest.9.d:0 "With the departure of the Republicans from the Democratic Coalition, many commentators wondered whether they would go their own way and risk splitting the conservative vote, or join forces with another rightist faction. Today, that answer was resoundingly answered, as Hillary Rodham appeared at a press conference flanked by multiple leading Republicans. She pledged that with the support of the American patriots besides her that American restoration was at hand, a vote for her would be all that is necessary to ‘restore this once great country of ours!’ While Bill Hammons’ office refuses to comment on the matter, insiders have detailed that any sense of cooperation between Bill Hammons and Mark Pryor has broken down, with the two no longer seeing eye to eye on most matters. Nevertheless, this is a big win for Hillary Rodham, who has hitherto been unable to accrue much influence within Denver thanks to the now-gone iron grip of the Democratic Coalition. With this, it looks as if she’s a true contestant for the highest office of the land."
 midwest.9.o1:0 "A dream of America?"
 midwest.10.t:0 "Hammons Suspends Campaign"
 midwest.10.d:0 "In news surprising to none following the recent political developments in the Union of the Heartlands, President Bill Hammons has suspended his reelection campaign. With the polls indicating that only 4% of the electorate intend to vote for him, President Hammons has dipped below United Heartlands candidate General Baker and is widely regarded as no longer being a viable candidate. This news indicates a tightening of the race in favour of frontrunner Hillary Rodham, as well as the undetermined Democratic nominee, widely expected to be Bill Clinton who has been leading in both delegate and grassroots support for some time. Commenting on Presidents decision, Hillary Rodham said that ‘Hammons saw that his campaign was untenable and did the honorable thing and suspended it’. The few remaining Coalition supporters have expressed disappointment, but there appears to be little appetite for running a replacement candidate. With that, Hammons presidency appears to be much like that of his predecessor’s, a one-term affair."
 midwest.10.o1:0 "Expected."
 midwest.11.t:0 "Return of Clinton"
 midwest.11.d:0 "With bright blue banners and celebrations, the Democratic Convention in Denver has now nominated the elder statesman Bill Clinton as their candidate for the 2010 elections. Clinton, sixty-four years old, is widely popular amongst party members although many within and without the party are questioning the wisdom of nominating an aging candidate whose roots in the Union go back to its founding. This, however, didn’t seem to bother the party delegates, who as expected nominated the candidate almost unanimously in a grand ceremony in the downtown Colorado Convention Center. Now, the Democratic Party is gearing up to a full election campaign, with the President out of the way and ready to take on Hillary Rodham with a candidate of their own. Already, the polls are indicating dead heat between the two, and the 2010 election is shaping up to be one of the most interesting ones since the formation of the country."
 midwest.11.o1:0 "So the old statesman throws his hat in..."
 midwest.12.t:0 "Rodham And Clinton Face Off"
 midwest.12.d:0 "The first debate of the election has come to a close, as only two of the parties reached the necessary fifteen percent polling requirement to attend the debate was centered around the two major candidates: Hillary Rodham and Bill Clinton. The debate was a sober and issues-oriented one, with the two candidates both wanting to put an end to the anarchy plaguing the Union and reaffirm the power of the central government, although they differed greatly on the methods which should be used, with Rodham advocating more hardline policies to bring the frontier in line, in contrast to Clinton’s reconciliation based approach. The matter of inter-American politics also reared its head, with the candidates discussing recent political developments in the UAPR, the Republic and the People’s Commonwealth, before reaffirming their wish to reunite the former United States of America under democratic governance. Of amusing note to many viewers, the two candidates were once married, with the debate still carrying a streak of tension from their divorce decades past. While Hillary Rodham had hitherto been regarded as a frontrunner in the race, Clinton’s strong performance seems to have given him a boost in support, with some polls even putting him in the lead. The absence of any other candidate is felt, as the race seems to ever more become a matter of Rodham versus Clinton."
 midwest.12.o1:0 "The centrists have lost the Union."
 midwest.13.t:0 "Liberty's Last Hurrah"
 midwest.13.d:0 "The failure of centrist darling Bill Hammons to mount an effective campaign and the hardline centralizing stances of the two main candidates, Hillary Rodham and Bill Clinton, have all been too much for the Midwest's libertarian and agrarian forces to handle. As Hammons still controls the civil service and state department, figures within the Wichita Unity Party have been calling upon city native and prominent Heartlander businessman David Koch to do what must be done, and suspend elections to protect the Heartlands from power-hungry zealots. Koch ally Mike Pompeo has notified the businessman, famously reclusive since the death of his brother Charles in the Atlantic Cruise Incident, that the state department has already been secured by the "business plotters". Hammons, Pompeo writes, remains completely oblivious to the moves of his own party. The question of what to do with this clear infiltration of the party and government by his loyalists has been left to David Koch himself - will the blessings of liberty be secured through bold action, or will the coup dissipate as if nothing ever happened?"

 midwest.14.d:0 "The end to the last year's political crisis finally seems to be at hand, as the presidential elections are coming up. Despite the wide field of candidates, and the multitude of issues facing the country, polling has consolidated around Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham, increasingly making the race a head-to-head competition. Although the ongoing crisis has made the distribution of ballots a difficult affair, and worries have been widespread of election fraud, local authorities across the country have largely assisted the ailing central government in letting the election go ahead, ensuring that, at least, the election would be regarded as largely legitimate. Nevertheless, numerous polling places across the country report harassment and attempted voter intimidation, especially in rural areas of the country, though it isn't expected to significantly affect the outcome of the election. As voters across the country congregate in bars, restaurants, churches and assembly halls, the nation batedly holds its breath to see who might lead it out of the current crisis. "

 midwest.15.t:0 "Clark Reveals Democratic Plot"
 midwest.15.d:0 "Perhaps what may be the most shocking outcome to General Wesley Clark’s investigation has come to fruition. In Denver today, at 10:30 AM, Clark travelled to the Capitol Building to meet privately with President Hammons in his office. There, he revealed a hefty dossier filled with compromising information regarding the Democratic Party. It turns out that Clark himself was targeted by the Democrats, attempting to recruit him to sabotage the Unity Party coalition government. With an elder statesman like Clark on their side, the Democrats could easily hold an unbreakable grip on political power in the Heartlands. As Clark left the office, he left behind a bewildered Hammons, now afraid that no one in his inner circle could be safe from targeting by his rivals."
 midwest.15.o1:0 "Traitors!" 
 midwest.16.t:0 "Hammons Removes Pryor"
 midwest.16.d:0 "Today, the President has ordered the dismissal of Vice President Mark Pryor. As General Clark’s findings continue to rock national politics, Bill Hammons has decided to take action against the Democrats; especially those in his executive branch. Pryor had been known for working well between Unity and Democrat party lines, which had gotten him that job earlier in the Hammons Administration. However, as the Unity Party severed itself from the Democrats, Pryor had to be cut loose as well. Democrat legislators spoke outside the capitol to various reporters, pointing out that the President had flagrantly broken the constitution, with some demanding his resignation. One thing is for sure, political disunity has become much, much worse because of today’s event, with many fearing for the future of the nation."
 midwest.16.o1:0 "Is that... legal?"
 midwest.17.t:0 "Democrats Begin Mutiny"
 midwest.17.d:0 "The removal of centrist Democrat Mark Pryor as Vice President was the last straw for the Democratic Coalition's liberal members, who have today resigned all of their cabinet positions within the government. William Jefferson Clinton, the unofficial leader of the Democratic caucus within the Democratic Coalition, has urged all liberal members of the government to follow in the Democratic leaders' examples, and reject the Unity Party and especially President Bill Hammons. The vice presidency, a position traditionally occupied by those of the political center but still of a caucus opposed to that of the President within the Coalition, Democrats argue, is now occupied by a stooge loyal only to President Hammons. Republicans, too, are unhappy, as they hoped for a centrist Republican of their own ranks to secure the second most powerful body in the Union."
 midwest.17.o1:0 "Damn you, Clinton!"
 midwest.18.t:0 "Clark Reacts Violently"
 midwest.18.d:0 "The attempt to recruit Wesley Clark to the Democratic Plot was not warmly received, with the former president replying in an expletive-filled letter, accusing the Democrats of being ‘spineless traitors’ and ‘weak-willed subversives’, alongside numerous other insults. The Democratic leadership responded worriedly to this response, with some even fearing that Clark would alert Bill Hammons, given the close relations between the two. The Democratic plot has definitely been hit by a setback, with the leadership scrambling to find a new way forward before Clark’s vengeance hits them."
 midwest.18.o1:0 "Oh no..."
 midwest.19.t:0 "President Hammons Notified"
 midwest.19.d:0 "President Bill Hammons had not expected the call from his mentor, former President Wesley Clark, and yet eagerly picked up the phone to respond when the former president called him. Clark spoke promptly and was very direct when he warned President Hammons of the Democratic plot, implicating the entire leadership of the Democratic party and warning him to watch even for his trusted Vice President Mark Pryor. Hammons was shaken by this news, and yet he could not help but to trust the former President, ending the call with a thanks as he had to make the toughest decision of his presidency yet. He could not trust his cabinet, and yet some part of him wondered if Clark was just playing him for a fool."

 midwest.20.t:0 "Hammons Purges Cabinet"
 midwest.20.d:0 "In a shock to the entire country, Bill Hammons announced the purge of his cabinet, citing ‘significant issues of loyalty’ directed particularly towards the Democratic members. With little to no warning, most ministries now stand without leadership, as the discharged cabinet members pack up their belongings and depart. This was ill-received by the populace, as Hammons’ cabinet purge appeared random and arbitrary, with some liberal commentators describing it as ‘a simple power grab, reminiscent of the Republican dictatorship in the American Republic’. Hammons, however, stands by his decision and in a press release underlines his accusations that the Democrats were out to undermine him. With this simple move, Hammons has effectively managed to alienate a large wing of the Democratic Coalition that has hitherto governed the country, and many wonder what fate shall befall the Coalition."
 midwest.20.o1:0 "Traitors."
 midwest.21.t:0 "Bodenstab Becomes VP"
 midwest.21.d:0 "Replacing the purged members of Bill Hammons’ cabinet hasn't taken long. With the Democratic Coalition still holding, however tentatively, and the desire for stable governance, the Heartlander Congress has approved many of his replacements, all from either the Unity Party or the Republican Party. The latest nominee, however, seems to have raised a lot of eyebrows across the country. Eric Bodenstab, a longtime personal friend of Hammons and a prominent member of the Unity Party, was nominated the stead of the deposed Pryor, despite little prior political experience. This caused uproar throughout society, feeding the impression that a desperate Hammons is doing all he can to maintain his grip on power, staffing his administration with supporters and cronies. This decision has already been criticised by Democratic leader Bill Clinton, who made thinly veiled comparisons to the regime of former President Bush in the American Republic, but it seems that Hammons has just barely enough political capital to push his nominee through Congress, at the cost of much of his remaining support. Now, Hammons’s power is secure, but his throne is one of sand. "

 midwest.22.t:0 "Rumors Of Conspiracy Spread"
 midwest.22.d:0 "The state of the Heartlander government can accurately be summed up as a ‘never ending firewatch’. It seems that where one fire is put out will another one arise, and just as Bill Hammons ended the cabinet plot that former president Wesley Clark warned him about, new rumours reached his ears. Now, it appears that not just Democrats but also the Republican Party, who so far have yet to cause a ruckus in the Democratic Coalition, are moving against Hammons, or so the rumour on the streets goes. While no concrete evidence has presented itself yet of any subterfuge, Bill Hammons is growing worried that his days in the high office may be coming to a close, as his secret meetings with Vice President Eric Bodenstab grow ever more frequent, and as his rating in the polls continues to drop precipitously. A more uncertain period is arriving in the Heartlands, brought about by its own president."
 midwest.22.o1:0 "Will Hammons fall?"
 midwest.23.t:0 "Hammons' Behavior Grows Erratic"
 midwest.23.d:0 "Analysts have grown increasingly worried about the recent behaviour of President Bill Hammons, who is apparently growing ever more isolated, rarely seen outside the Presidential palace. With most matters of day-to-day government handled by his Vice President Eric Bodenstab, most of Hammons’ recent public appearances have been press conferences where the President, showing obvious symptoms of insomnia, rambles in length about ‘attempts by subversive elements to subvert our democracy’ and calls for ‘all true patriots’, in particular his own colleagues of the Unity Party, to ‘step up against those who would do our great nation harm’. While few politicians have so far offered comments on the matter, members of both the Republican and Democratic parties have increasingly distanced themselves from the Unity Party in action, voting against the whip ever more frequently in Congress. Hammons’ office seems to have paid little mind to this, as the behaviour of the president grows ever more erratic."
 midwest.23.o1:0 "...and Clark grows silent."
 midwest.24.t:0 "Hammons' Advisors Walk Out"
 midwest.24.d:0 "The recent behaviour of the President has become too much for his staff. During a normal meeting in the executive, which had by now gotten into a routine of Bill Hammons flinging accusations at his coalition partners with little pause, it became too much. In what appeared to be a carefully choreographed motion, his entire staff rose from the table at once, Democrats and Republicans alike, and simply left the meeting without a word to be said. Bill Hammons was confused by this turn of events, first demanding for them to come back, then pleading with them when he realised that he had probably lost them for good. With their departure, the Democratic and Republican parties soon followed, with both parties declaring that the Democratic Coalition was now unsalvageable, and that the President is no longer fit for the office."
 midwest.24.o1:0 "And so the Coalition shatters."
 midwest.25.t:0 "Articles Of Impeachment Formed"
 midwest.25.d:0 "President Bill Hammons’ latest behaviour has been widely criticised by many across the political spectrum, particularly by leading figures of the Democratic Party, long alienated by the eccentric and hostile behaviour of the president. In light of the recent walkout of his advisors, the Democrats have now accused Hammons of being unfit for the office of President, and have gone as far as to draw up articles of impeachment against both him and his Vice President Eric Bodenstab. This significant move has seen a mixed reception outside the Democratic Party, with the Republicans tersely acknowledging the articles while being criticised by even Hammons-critical Unity Party members. With Hammons withdrawing ever more inwards, there seems to be little effort from the president to halt the motion. The Democrats do not hold a majority in Congress, however, and must win over the Republicans, who are generally reluctant about the motion and would rather wait out the rest of Hammons’ presidency. As the motion is put forward in Congress, and the final votes are tallied..."

 midwest.26.d:0 "With the passage of the motion of impeachment, Bill Hammons’ presidency has at long last come to a close, and in the hopes of the Democratic Party, the instability plaguing the Union of the Heartlands too. As Vice President Eric Bodenstab was impeached alongside the President, the presidency now falls to the Speaker of the House, the Democrat Mark Udall of Colorado. Udall is a noted liberal and an environmentalist. Already, some Republican dissenters are criticising the decision to impeach, having preferred for only Hammons to be impeached at most and for Bodenstab to take over as caretaker president until the elections later this year. Nevertheless, Udall has pledged to bring the country back together, restore sensible government and fix the mistakes of the Hammons Presidency."
 midwest.26.o1:0 "Can the speaker of the house look forward?"
 midwest.27.t:0 "Republicans Mutiny To Isolationists"
 midwest.27.d:0 "It seems that the critical sentiments of the dissident Republicans have spread among the party. Critical of Udall’s liberal credentials, as well as the support attracted by the Democrats over the successful impeachment, many former pro-impeachment voices within the Republican Party have now criticised the decision, calling it a grave mistake and regretting their own roles in it. With the Republican leadership remaining supportive of impeachment, however, the party seems close to tearing itself apart. Already, many dissident Republicans have jumped ship to the Isolationist Party, which was always critical of impeachment, doubling its Congressional Representation already with many more defections expected in the coming days and weeks. The Republican leadership has rushed to stem the bleeding, but seeming stooges of the Democratic Party and its recent seizure of power, they have had little luck. Now, with the Isolationist Party in rapid growth and the Unity Party increasingly courted by the Isolationists, it seems that Democratic dominance may not be as certain any longer."
 midwest.27.o1:0 "Terrible."
 midwest.28.t:0 "Tancredo Becomes Speaker"
 midwest.28.d:0 "With the ascension of Mark Udall to the highest office, a new Speaker has to be elected for the House of Representatives. Although the Democrats were hopeful that they could retain the post, their chances declined rapidly when the Republican Party saw a mass-scale mutiny in favour of the Isolationist Party. Now, with the votes of the Isolationist Party, a unanimous and vengeful Unity Party and even a handful of remaining Republicans, Isolationist Tom Tancredo has been elected as Speaker. Tancredo, a right-wing hardliner from Colorado, has pledged to vigorously oppose the ‘radical Chomskyist’ agenda of Mark Udall and to stand up for ‘true American values’ in his function as Speaker of the House. While the President has stated that he’s ready and willing to work together with the Speaker, many other democrats are worried by his ties with right-radical militias, and fear that the current congressional situation will only worsen with Tancredo as the speaker."
 midwest.28.o1:0 "A house divided..."
 midwest.29.t:0 "House Launches Coup"
 midwest.29.d:0 "The decline of the Republican Party has significantly upset the balance of power in Congress. Whereas the Democratic Coalition could work together, Congress has now been sharply divided into two wings: Those in favour of President Udall, and those opposed to him. This divide has gone straight down the middle, deadlocking Congress and causing many of Udall’s policies to get shot down; he barely even has a full cabinet yet. Nobody could have predicted the outcome, however: what was supposed to be another day of deadlock was interrupted when, on Speaker Tom Tancredo’s invitation, the Congressional Building was flooded by heavily armed right-wing militias, seemingly just being let in by Capitol Police. Tancredo was prepared, having already drafted a Motion of Impeachment towards President Udall. The motion was passed at literal gunpoint, as Democrats and Hope Partyists were threatened to vote in favour or pay the highest price. A couple of Congress members stood their ground, and were removed from the chamber in response. As Udall’s government is quickly and effectively ousted, it now stands to Tancredo who should be nominated as VP and thus be made acting president."

 midwest.30.d:0 "Republican reluctance towards House Speaker Mark Udall proved enough, particularly once it turned out that charges of impeachment would likewise be raised against Vice President Eric Bodenstab and the presidency would thus pass to the speaker. As such, the Unity Party could quickly and effectively win over the Republican votes, causing the Impeachment Motion to fail. To the chagrin of the Democrats, Bill Hammons’ Presidency has been preserved. This caused little action by the President, still deep in isolation with only Eric Bodenstab as the link between the President and the rest of the world, with Bodenstab trying his absolute best to just keep the ship that is the Union of the Heartlands going. The Democrats are reeling from this defeat, with the Liberal press starkly critiquing their failure at unseating the President. With that, it appears that the Heartlander chaos is fated to continue..."

 midwest.31.t:0 "Brutal Deadlock Continues"
 midwest.31.d:0 "Although the Republicans and the Unity Party could agree to not impeach President Bill Hammons, there is a majority for little else in Congress, as bill after bill fails and polarisation increases. Politicians that worked together months ago can now barely look each other in the eyes, even as a few officials bravely attempt to right the course. Impromptu alliances have formed between Vice President Eric Bodenstab and a number of politicians from multiple parties, yet these are not enough to turn the tide, as congressional infighting festers evermore. Bill Hammons is heard from on only a select few occasions, speaking through his Vice President, barely with anything more to say than weak and weary pleas for unity. Deadlock has had terrible consequences for the Union of the Heartlands, as appropriations have shut down completely and officials’ paychecks arrive only with ever-increasing difficulty. The country is truly at a standstill, with little seeming to break the stalemate that has arisen. With political radicalism growing more popular with the Heartlander populace, many wonder how the nation will escape this crisis."

Deadlock continues in the Capitol Building, with lawmakers bickering while poverty continues its rampage through the plains. Border authorities in the American Republic, Illinois and the Great Lakes have reported an uptick in the stream of refugees as well. While rumors should never be trusted, this situation has led some to believe that General Clark, whom some call the “Founding Father of the Heartlands” may be preparing a return to the halls of power. These might just be whispers and baseless theories, but it seems that the situation is prime for a new, central authority in the American heartland. Possibly, just possibly, the General may return."

It seemed many of them were headed towards the government quarter, home to all of the nation's major governing buildings. Without much opposition in the streets, the army had captured the capitol by nine o’clock, where General Sidney McChrystal spoke on the steps of the building. He then declared that he was the ringleader in today’s events, and that he has established a temporary administration over the country, dismissing President Hammons from his duties effective immediately. However, he closed the speech by resigning his position after only minutes of leading the Union of the Heartlands, nominating General, and former President, Wesley Clark as his successor. Clark is now headed towards Denver, where he will take the oath of office yet again."

This month’s shipments of grain and vegetables destined for cities never arrived. Although the reasons for this are unknown, many attribute it to the decentralizing policies of the Hammons Administration. Unconfirmed reports of rotting foodstuffs sitting in crates in vast government warehouses have been repeated by the opposition and have fueled distrust in the government within cities. This situation has many people within the Democratic Coalition questioning the ability of the administration to mount an adequate response to prevent a crisis. Within the cities, members of the Unity Party have openly challenged government policy. Most notably, David Koch, once thought to be a party of Hammons’ inner circle, suggested that the government organize a commission to investigate government misconduct relating to this matter and “pursue a different approach in the name of stability”, in a speech given outside his Wichita home earlier today. Only time will tell whether this will resolve itself or lead to the fracturing of Hammons’ governing coalition. The President has not yet commented on the situation."

Following the failure of the government to distribute adequate amounts of food to the residents for the second month in a row, riots have broken out in the city accompanied by looting and some incidents of arson. Although disorganized, it is clear that the rioters are united in placing the blame for their current situation on the Hammons Administration and their decentralization programme. People have been forced to turn to the black market for meals. It is not yet clear what the government plans to do in order to avert the complete breakdown in social order throughout the city."

The media has decried the spree as the restoration of “frontier values” in a city without order. While no one party has been responsible for the breakdown in social order, three groups in particular have evoked great ire from people within the city. The far-right Eagles, led by Merlin Miller’s Isolationist Party as well as various far-left urban groups under the banner of United Heartlands, have been accused of glorifying the thieves, albeit for different reasons.

The military has assumed the role of the local police force and has set up headquarters in the downtown area. Order has been restored in the city, but it is unclear as to whether it will last past the military deployment. These moves appear to be too little, too late, however, for the President. Members of his cabinet, as well as senior party members, have made it clear that they have lost faith in the President and may seek to form a new government in the coming weeks.

The first step, Pompeo declares, is to infilitrate the campaigns of Clinton and pressure low-level staffers, especially those working in the field of defense, into granting the Unity Party a voice into the future of the coalition. The second step is to exploit the turmoil surrounding the election process to centralize intelligence and defense agencies and government departments, to forge a state department loyal to Hammons.

Buffett has already been accused of assassinating Koch to take power in an authoritarian manner, even though he claims his "Business Plot", as it has already been labeled, was merely to restore order and hasten the transition to a Clinton administration.

In an event that is being compared to the monumetal debates of Lincoln and Douglas, Rubio of Florida, a staunch American Restorationist and loyalist of Hillary Rodham, espoused his desire for a quick and speedy American unification to restore conservative democracy, while Christie of New Jersey, the heir of a moderate republican tradition, defended the Democratic Coalition and Hammons from Rubio's persistent attacks. Rubio's attacks on Christie focused on his disdain for Bill Hammons, who he claims Christie as a member of the Democratic Coalition is enabling and allowing to "make the Union of the Heartlands more like the rest of the world". Criticizing communist interference in the government, of which he believes Democratic Party members like Mark Pryor and Bill Clinton are enabling, Rubio called for speedy unification and militant anti-extremism, especially when referring to the UAPR. Christie, on the other hand, espoused a more agrarian, rural, localist position.

The most overtly pro-Buchanan is Catholic traditionalist, anti-immigration activist, and paleoconservative Paul Gosar of Wyoming. Gosar has expressed the need for a more radically Christian alternative to more secular nationalist politicians, along with a "no-compromise" style of governance for the Isolationist Party, rejecting coalitions with the Republicans or the American Restorationists, largely defunct since their loss to Bill Clinton in 2011. The second major candidate is Isolationist house leader Tom Tancredo, known for decades of experience within the political world promoting paleoconservative beliefs. Tancredo, a fervent isolationist and anti-immigrant politician, seeks to bring the party back to its roots as a party opposed to the unification of America and emblematic of right-wing frontier spirits. The third candidate is Kris Kobach, who although radical in his own right, has never truly labeled himself as a paleoconservative. Focusing on immigration but also economic arguments for tax cuts, defense of the capitalist system, and anti-communism, Kobach is the most reasonable choice for those that would seek a coalition with Republicans."

As Clinton makes his disgraceful exit, three candidates have arisen to carry on his mantle. Former Speaker of the House Mark Udall comes from a long-time Western political family with ties to the old Democratic Coalition elite, and his commitment to liberal values could never be understated. However, many find Udall old, lethargic, and too much of a patrician to guide the American frontier. Such opponents have rallied around two politicians relatively unknown outside of Colorado - Michael Bennet and Jared Polis.

The first candidate is well-known among American Restorationist circles, a former Representative himself - Marco Rubio. Described as an emigré from the Republic's stronghold in Florida, Rubio has expressed the need for Republicans to serve as a bold reminder of America's future, and stand for a quick and potent unification process across the country. More localist and decentralized Heartlanders may empathize more with Chris Christie, an old Republican whose legendary debates with Rubio attracted hundreds of thousands to their televisions.

The Hammons loyalist candidate is Eric Bodenstab, Hammons' former Chief of Staff with little political experience to his own name. A supporter of centrism above all, Bodenstab is inoffensive, but is hardly loved by anyone in the Union, his campaign reeling from Hammons' low approval. The Clark loyalist is Chuck Hagel, a devoted centrist who aided the Heartlands' military in the conquests of the Rodham administration, even if he could only do so from the sidelines. A democratic stalwart, military mind, and career politician, Hagel is unpopular, but enjoys much support from the party elite. The last candidate is eccentric businessman John Hickenlooper.

McChrystal's blessing and the support of an apolitical army has become all too relevant in an increasingly anarchic union, and his official seal of approval towards the new government, along with that of the legislature and of course, of the Heartlander people, all encompass necessary measures for a government to truly be declared legitimate. [Root.GetLeader]'s radical policies of centralization of the Union, the end of the agrarian, libertarian anarchy that has taken hold of the country during the Hammons era, and increased international legitimacy efforts for American re-unifiation mark a turn away from anarchy and a pivot toward strong, internationalist rule."

 midwest.50.t:0 "New Congress Sworn In"
 midwest.50.d:0 "Following Tom Tancredo's legendary seizure of power in the Union of the Heartlands, anchored by the support of the people and that of a Republican-Isolationist congressional coalition, one thing is certain - the rule of [Root.GetLeader] remains unstable. His nationalist, paleoconservative agenda and controversial statements many interpret to be in support of Christian supremacy and white nationalism, have angered liberals in the Union to the core, and among the government exists much fear and apprehension over a counter-coup. As a result, a new congress has been sworn in, one filled to the brim with Isolationists, Republicans, and American Restorationists, to the chagrin and outrage of Liberals and the Party of Hope. The measure, which the President declares is necessary for stability and for the Heartlands to leave anarchy, remains hostile and divisive, but one thing is certain - as Isolationist power is consolidated, the Heartlands truly turns away from anarchy and toward the enlightened ideals of God and nation."

 news.296.t:0 "The Business Plot"
 news.296.d:0 "Intriguing news has arrived from Wichita, the new de-facto seat of the Union of the Heartlands. David Koch, a reclusive politician and businessman whose brother perished in the Atlantic Cruise, has seized the capital and has suspended the controversial 2011 Elections, which saw two centralizers pitted against each other. Koch, a noted libertarian with ties to both nationalist conservative and socially liberal movements, was one of Hammons' most prominent economic advisors. Although his proposals to mend the anarchy through economic development largely failed due to the inaction of the Coalition, international observers expect Koch to continue such projects on much broader levels, and transform the Heartlands back into a unifying force.\n\nKoch has already filled his government with figures interested in a military re-unification of the United States such as Mike Pompeo, one of his most critical Kansan allies. His coalition of libertarians, nationalists, and Democratic Coalition stalwarts, however, may not agree on the fine details."

 news.297.d:0 "Intriguing news has arrived from Denver, where the long-time Unity Party-led Democratic Coalition has finally dissipated in favor of rule by their junior coalition partners, the old Democratic Party. William Jefferson Clinton, one of the founding fathers of the Union, has rejoined politics to heal the Heartlands' anarchy and pursue a diplomatic American unification as was originally heralded by the unification of the Heartlands in 1991. Beloved by the Democratic establishment and the people of the frontier, Clinton's new democratic legitimacy could pose a threat to American nations far and wide, although it is unknown how the Heartlands' opposition will take his centralizing measures.\n\nCritics of Clinton have labelled his regime as gerontocratic, an emblem of an older America, but it is clear that many Americans still clamour for a return to normalcy, a return Clinton will surely provide."

 news.298.d:0 "Intriguing news has arrived from Denver, where after years of decentralization and anarchy under their rule, the Democratic Coalition has finally fallen to an opposition candidate. Hillary Rodham, one of the Heartlands' strongest politicians, has led the American Restorationist Party, now aligned with the Heartlands branch of the Republican Party, to victory in the 2011 Elections against her old political ally Bill Clinton. Rodham, the most jingoistic of the Heartlands' major politicians, is beloved by many and despised by most; if she attempts to unify America under a new conservative democratic order, she will face trials and tribulations from both the international community and her own countrymen.\n\nBut one thing is certain - Rodham has an iron resolve, and will not let the Heartlands fall, nor the dream of a democratic America. The enemies of America - nationalists, socialists, fascists, communists - all should tremble at the transformation of the Union from a capitalist laughingstock to a new America."

 news.299.d:0 "Intriguing news has arrived from Denver, where former Heartlands President Wesley Clark has "restored order", and launched a coup against the Hammons administration to restore strength in a land of anarchy. Clark, known for his ineffectual leadership but brilliant military mind, still remains somewhat of a folk hero among many in the Heartlands frontier, who credit Hammons, not Clark, with the anarchic state of the current Union. Clark's administration, one filled with generals and former Democratic Coalition members, looks to be surprisingly liberal for a nationalist Junta, leading international observers to place upon him the title of "the American Napoleon".\n\nIt is uncertain whether Clark's merger of liberal social and economic policies with an authoritarian, nationalist, and unification-hungry America will result in glory or collapse, but regardless, one thing is certain - the Heartlands is no longer the laughingstock of global capitalism, but a force to be feared."

 news.300.d:0 "Intriguing news has arrived from Denver, where the conservative House of Representatives has completely seized the Union of the Heartlands and appointed statesman Pat Buchanan to lead them into the future. Although never associated with the far-right Isolationist Party, an anti-interventionist opponent of the Restorationists, Buchanan was welcomed by the party to become the next President of the Heartlands. A traditionalist Catholic with clear aversions to the statism, hawkish foreign policy, and "weakness" of the Republic, Buchanan and his "paleoconservatives" practice a much different brand of nationalist democracy.\n\nWhether Buchanan's hard-right dreams stand the test of time or result in a failed traditionalist state born from the ashes of the Heartlands, one thing is certain - a New America is at hand for the people of the frontier."

 news.301.d:0 "Intriguing news has arrived from Denver, where the conservative House of Representatives has completely seized the Union of the Heartlands and appointed controversial leader of the Isolationist Party Merlin Miller to lead them into the future. Following his surprising victory in the Isolationist Party's leadership spill some years back, Miller's leadership has brought the party firmly to the far-right. Miller's "Eagles", a paramilitary arm of his radical wing of the Isolationist Party, are utterly devoted to "defending the borders of the Heartlands" and "crushing the anarchic forces that have made our nation the laughingstock of the world", have already begun to harass leftist agitators and whip congressmen into submission.\n\nMiller, however, faces considerable opposition even within his own party; it will be his job as a stalwart of the frontier to prove to the people and the nation that he and his "Eagles" are here to stay."

 news.302.d:0 "Intriguing news has arrived from Omaha, the new de-facto seat of the Union of the Heartlands. Warren Buffett, who had almost completely controlled the decentralized city through his business empire and puppeted politicians, has now taken control of the entire Heartlands, promising a new social liberal, Democratic Party order in America. A fierce opponent of Bill Hammons, many expected Buffett to support Bill Clinton for the 2011 elections, but following the assassination of fellow businessman David Koch, it seems Buffett had other ideas to stabilize the union. With Koch, his main business and political enemy, out of the picture, international observers expect Buffett to centralize control around a liberal, pro-business administration.\n\nThe Democratic Party, once controlled by Clinton and allies, is expected to support the Buffett regime as it stabilizes the Heartlands, strengthens business ties to Canada, and fights the fascists of the Northwest."
