 MWA_RED_WORLD_DESC:0 "The Union of the Heartlands is a relative oddity in the grand scheme of post-American nations. Despite claiming to be the inheritor of the old United States, the Heartlands is not considered to be a serious contender in the battle to claim the mantle of the once-United States. Extreme decentralization has caused a state of borderline Anarchy in the nation's plentiful rural areas, all while President Hammons' approval ratings continue to slide. However beyond the lawlessness and division, lies one of the few American claimants truly committed to the ideals of Democracy and Liberty, and mabye, just mabye, the Heartlands can pull off a miracle, and at last restore the ideals of Liberty to the once-United States."

 ### Starting Ideas ###
 
 MWA_extensive_decentralization:0 "Extensive Decentralization"
 MWA_extensive_decentralization_desc:0 "The rural character of our Union has necessitated the need for a heavily decentralized administration. This approach, championed by President Hammons, has both its detractors and supporters, with many, particularly on the right, favouring this system due to our territory's Agrarian and Localist nature, while others declare that the approach of designating so much authority to local administration has created a two-tier society with a lopsided application of the law. Outside of Hammons' coalition, support for such levels of Decentralization is sparse, and many predict that the issue will play a key role in the next election - if it ever arrives."
 MWA_lawless_countryside:0 "Widespread Lawlessness"
 MWA_lawless_countryside_desc:0 "While our Union is far from existing in a state of Anarchy, crime and lawlessness, especially in the more rural areas, has become a very significant concern. In looked-over towns across Middle America, local officials have taken the laws into their own hands, leading to the creation of highly-dangerous fiefdoms founded by either criminals or renegade law enforcement officers across our nation. As well, petty crime, especially within the countryside, has risen to out-of-control levels, further allowing these problems to spill into major urban areas. Overall, the skyrocketing crime in rampant areas is a problem we can no longer ignore, even if some are entirely content doing so."
 MWA_agrarian_society_modifier:0 "Agrarian Society"
 MWA_agrarian_society_modifier_desc:0 "Given our nation's composure of the most Agrarian regions of the Former United States, the Heartlands are naturally a nation which leans heavily on Agriculture in most areas of economic development. Control of the American breadbasket has proven invaluable to our nation's status, with our neighbors proving hesitant to attack us due to potential to compromise their own food supply - however it has also severely stunted the development of our nation, with the Heartlands barely advancing in any meaningful way since the 90's. As it seems, our nation's Agrarian status is both a blessing and a curse."
 
 MWA_scars_of_unification:0 "Scars of Unification"
 MWA_scars_of_unification_desc:0 "While America may have been brought back from the ashes, the scars of 20 years of division still run deep throughout our nation. With much of the nation continuing to lie in ruins due to decades of conflict, many predict that it may be years before America can truly be whole once more, in spirit and in actuality."

 MWA_clarks_return:0 "The American Napoleon"
 MWA_clarks_return_desc:0 "The bitter failure of the Centrist Establishment has forced the hand of General Clark. With Denver rendered useless by constant deadlock, it has been decided that only the steady hand of former President Wesley J. Clark, who promises to end the political stalemate and at last restore America to its former glory. The question is, does Clark have the means to do so?"
 MWA_silence_establishment_bickering:0 "Silence Establishment Bickering"
 MWA_silence_establishment_bickering_desc:0 "The divided political scene of our great nation was indeed the driving force behind General Clark's decision. The countless establishment politicians who have never experienced the glory of military service have no right to dictate the running of the Heartlands. Only an iron fist and an iron will will protect ourselves from the trappings of political deadlock."
 MWA_unrepentant_militarism:0 "Unrepentant Militarism"
 MWA_unrepentant_militarism_desc:0 "America's restoration is set to be no easy task. Our nation's own diminutive stature in comparison to the Commonwealth and the UAPR has come as a great disadvantage to us. If we are to secure victory on the great American battlefield, then we must instill a sense of martial discipline within the minds and the bodies of our populace. Under the great American Napoleon, we shall secure the restoration of our beloved United States, and at last banish weakness off the face of our continent."
 MWA_civilian_corps:0 "New Civilian Corps"
 MWA_civilian_corps_desc:0 "There remain some within our nation who are either incapable or unwilling to devote themselves to a life in the Military, these people, despite their incapability of serving the Heartlands on the battlefield, still have a valuable part to play in the restoration of the United States. Under Clark's guidance, we shall restore the AmeriCorps, allowing those who cannot serve to contribute to the rebirth of our great American Experiment."
 MWA_gay_marrige:0 "Legalize Gay Marriage"
 MWA_gay_marrige_desc:0 "General Clark has observed that under his command lie countless proud Americans from countless stripes of life. Among those who proudly serve our country are Homosexuals who still cannot marry, leaving their significant others without compensation in the event of their death. This cannot stand. Under Clark's iron fist, Gay Marriage shall be at last legalized within the Heartlands."
 MWA_liberal_social_policy:0 "Liberal Social Policy"
 MWA_liberal_social_policy_desc:0 "On the battlefield, it doesn't matter the colour of one's skin nor the alignment of their sexuality. Those who have been so brave as to stand for the new America come from countless walks of life - and Clark will not tolerate those who dare to disparage any proud American patriot. Our policy shall be one of unabashed Social Liberalism, protecting men and women both enlisted and otherwise. A strict code of anti-Racism shall be adopted, and the rights to Abortion will be protected."
 MWA_clean_air_and_water:0 "Clean Air and Water"
 MWA_clean_air_and_water_desc:0 "The changing climate has become a fact of plain observation to most within the world, however here in the Heartlands some have been so bold as to deny the existence of our shifting ecosystem. Clark, recognizing the health and welfare of our populace as paramount, has enacted strict regulation to contain airborne and waterborne pollutants, and prepare the Heartlands for a climate-friendly future."
 MWA_the_new_eisenhower:0 "In the Footsteps of Great Men"
 MWA_the_new_eisenhower_desc:0 "As the Heartlands looks to their uniform-clad savior, General-turned-President Clark has utilized his prowess to inspire a new generation of true Americans. With an Eisenhowerian demeanor and a style of leadership born from the teachings of Napoleon himself, Wesley Clark is determined to shape America in his image... or die trying."
 MWA_new_american_patriotism:0 "New American Patriotism"
 MWA_new_american_patriotism_desc:0 "After 1987 many considered the concept of 'America' to be lost to the dust of Reaganism. Yet now, a new Patriotism has been born by General Clark's efforts - one which has seen the values of the Stars and Stripes reborn here in the Heartlands after decades of decay. While Separatists may wince at this cultural shift, it has become clear that the only way forward is to restore the mighty United States."
 MWA_new_healthcare_system:0 "Public Healthcare System"
 MWA_new_healthcare_system_desc:0 "If we are to restore the American Experiment built by our founding fathers, we must realize the gravitas of our national situation. Within the Heartlands, countless languish without sufficient access to healthcare. The access to such vital care has become a luxury to many. This cannot stand. At once, we must create a single-payer healthcare system within our new United States."
 MWA_clarks_america:0 "Clark's American Restoration"
 MWA_clarks_america_desc:0 "At long last, the armies of the Heartlands have broken through the gates of Olympus. While some have called the General mad for daring to dream, it seems that Denver's gamble has paid off in the end. The Stars and Stripes once more wave proudly from Sea to Shining Sea. Yet there is much work to be done if we are to truly restore the American Dream. Let us begin."
 MWA_reaching_light_speed:0 "Beyond Light Speed"
 MWA_reaching_light_speed_desc:0 "One oft-forgotten yet still tragic consequence of the Soviet Union's victory in the Cold War was the abandonment of global space exploration. With NASA proudly being restored following Reunification, President Clark has begun an extensive program to help conquer the frontiers of tomorrow. We must push ourselves to conquer the stars; light-speed technology shall soon be within our grasp."
 MWA_loyal_congress:0 "Subordinate Congress"
 MWA_loyal_congress_desc:0 "With the halls of power in new Washington being staffed by men in uniform, the purpose of Congress has seemed exhausted to many. However Clark fancies himself as no dictator, despite the complaints of countless detractors. The time has come to release the Military's hold on civilian government - so long as they prove willing to do what's best for America."
 MWA_military_role_in_reconstruction:0 "AmeriCorp Reconstruction"
 MWA_military_role_in_reconstruction_desc:0 "America has been left in ruins ever since the war of reclamation. With President Clark having restored the AmeriCorps before the Great War, we already have a hearty Civilian Corps dedicated to assisting the military in matters of reconstruction. Now, we can expand these efforts across the new United States, and slowly yet surely restore America to its pre-1987 glory."
 MWA_new_internationalism:0 "Revive the Internationalist Crusade"
 MWA_new_internationalism_desc:0 "The cause of Capitalism, to many, was vanquished unquestionably after the disaster of 1987. Under Clark's guide, we have undoubtedly proven them wrong. And yet still, those who deny the need for America to reclaim its place on the World Stage exist. We must prove these doubters wrong, and restore the pride and prowess that the USA once enjoyed. Onward, to Europe!"
 
 MWA_paleocons:0 "Paleoconservative Recovery"
 MWA_paleocons_desc:0 "Few would have expected the Paleoconservative crusade of Buchanan and Tancredo to be victorious on the stage of Heartlander politics. Now, this burgeoning movement, ready to reject the decades of past failures, has stepped up to usher in an era of unabashed Conservatism across the American Midwest. While some may scoff at the President's efforts, [MWA.GetLeader] will not allow the jeers of Liberals and Communists distract him from his efforts to restore the American Dream."
 MWA_revive_the_vision_of_ashbrook:0 "Rehabilitate Ashbrook"
 MWA_revive_the_vision_of_ashbrook_desc:0 "A young Pat Buchanan first got his political career started in John Ashbrook's White House. While the Liberal media has been ever eager to vilify Ashbrook in the aftermath of the Spanish affair, the facts remain that Ashbrook was a true paragon of Conservative values in stark contrast to the failed Liberalism of Reagan and Bush. The time has come to set the record straight."
 MWA_a_second_conservative_revolution:0 "A True Conservative Revolution"
 MWA_a_second_conservative_revolution_desc:0 "Despite the pitiful attempts of 'Moderates' such as Rodham, the fact remains that the New Right is the only movement with the legitimacy to represent the Conservative movement in the Heartlands. Buchanan, himself an exile from the watered-down Conservatism of the Bush era, is determined to bring his fervently isolationist vision to the forefront of Heartlander politics - icing out any who may stand in his way."
 MWA_heartland_values:0 "Strict Social Conservatism"
 MWA_heartland_values_desc:0 "While Liberals and Communists may be eager to preach the gospel of Homosexuality and Abortion instead of the irrefutable word of our one lord God, President Buchanan knows well enough that the good God-fearing people of the Heartlands won't be fooled by such drivel. We shall aim to protect our Midwestern family values against all those who seek to erode the Nuclear Family in the name of 'Progress' and 'Tolerance'."
 MWA_new_nativism:0 "New Nativism"
 MWA_new_nativism_desc:0 "America's values are under attack. Such is clear to anybody who has been paying attention to the last 20 years. While the Communists in Philadelphia and Los Angeles attempt to destroy the American Way of Life, and do-nothing politicians in Atlanta stand by, President Buchanan is eager to protect American heritage. The time has come to reach back, restore the spirit of the Know-Nothings."
 MWA_appeal_to_patriotic_leftists:0 "Appeal to Patriotic Leftists"
 MWA_appeal_to_patriotic_leftists_desc:0 "While this stance may come off as confusing to many within our own camp, President Buchanan realizes that not all on the other side of the spectrum are an entirely lost cause. Working with figures such as Lenora Fulani, Buchanan shall work to create a formidable alliance with those on the left, including the many Trade Unions which call the Heartlands Home."
 MWA_media_empire:0 "A Media Empire"
 MWA_media_empire_desc:0 "Controlling the narrative is key to maintaining political power in this day and age. The rise of Cable Television and Talk Radio has provided Conservatism with a fertile new ground for expanding grassroots support. Utilizing our connections within the Radio and Television scene, the Paleoconservative movement shall aim to shape the narrative through friendly broadcasts and coverage, all while buying out stations critical to our message."
 MWA_paleocon_america:0 "Ashbrook Avenged"
 MWA_paleocon_america_desc:0 "At last the Communists, Liberals and false Conservatives have been driven from the face of the United States. While some had been content in our own self-imposed isolation, Buchanan and his Paleoconservative movement have pulled off the impossible, bringing back the United States and restoring the legacy of President Ashbrook. Our forefathers would be proud of us."
 MWA_victory_in_the_culture_war:0 "Victory in the Culture War"
 MWA_victory_in_the_culture_war_desc:0 "At last, our struggle against Homosexuality, Abortion and Anti-Christian Values has been won by the iron fist of the Paleoconservative movement. With Congress under the President's control, we can at last codify our efforts, ensuring that America remains a morally upstanding nation worthy of God's love. No longer shall 'Liberals' and Communists be able to use the cause of sinners as a cudgel against our movement."
 MWA_liquidate_communism:0 "Liquidate Communism"
 MWA_liquidate_communism_desc:0 "So much of our nation spent decades languishing under the tyranny of Communists, Socialist and Liberal forces. With Conservatism at last conquering the halls of power in Washington, we can at last mobilize our forces to at last stamp out the Hammer and Sickle. The FBI and the New CIA shall be dispatched to destroy any remains of the Communist Jackboot on our soil, and ensure that any form of Communism, be it Marxism or Liberalism, is never allowed to flourish on American soil."
 MWA_strict_isolationism:0 "Strict Isolationism"
 MWA_strict_isolationism_desc:0 "Our great work in securing the American continent has been finished. While we detest the wicked forces of Communism across the mighty Atlantic, it is no longer America's place to play World Police. For too long Conservative paragons such as Ashbrook and false Communistic Liberal agents such as Rumsfeld have been caught up in Interventionism's siren call. No longer."
 MWA_a_republic_not_an_empire:0 "A Republic, Not An Empire"
 MWA_a_republic_not_an_empire_desc:0 "The America First policy has finally proved its worth. As the rest of the World remains locked in bitter ideological conflict, America focuses on rebuilding the shattered streets and lives, repairing our nation after the devastation incurred during the Reclamation War. While Buchanan may no longer be running the show, his vision has prevailed, and at long last, Paleoconservativism has proven its worth to even the most seditious of Liberals."
 
 MWA_miller:0 "Miller's Presidency"
 MWA_miller_desc:0 "By far the most unlikely player on the political scene has stepped up in the Heartland's hour of need. Merlin Miller, backed by his infamous 'Eagles' Paramilitary, has secured power in the Union of the Heartlands, promising a crackdown on all Communists and non-Christians within our territory. While we appreciate Buchanan's contributions, saving America is a job for President Miller alone."
 MWA_reach_out_to_tanceredo:0 "Reach out to Tancredo"
 MWA_reach_out_to_tanceredo_desc:0 "Speaker Tancredo was the most critical supporter of the House's coup against Udall. While Tancredo shares Miller's virulent hatred of immigrants, he has also expressed skepticism towards the more 'Radical' portions of Miller's agenda. Facilitating a meeting with friendly representatives such as Representative Gosar, we shall secure the Speaker's loyalty - which will further aid in efforts to push through Miller's agenda."
 MWA_protect_our_european_american_heritage:0 "Protect our Euro-American Heritage"
 MWA_protect_our_european_american_heritage_desc:9 "The forces of Globalism have long sought to dilute America's racial identity with immigration and interracial marriage. While we have no desire to formally illegalize such practices, our stance must be made clear - miscegenation is a threat to the United States - any while we hold no ill will towards minorities, we must protect America's white majority. We are a Party for White Americans."
 MWA_a_new_hollywood:0 "Rebuild Hollywood"
 MWA_a_new_hollywood_desc:0 "Even before its takeover by Communist forces, Hollywood was polluted by Zionist forces attempting to brainwash Americans into doing their bidding.

 heartlands.1.d:0 "The nation is understandably in an uproar after the recent Military Coup in Denver. Across the aisle, furious denunciations of the General's actions have rang out, with many vowing even to violently oppose the new administration. However with a firm command of the nation's armed forces, any such violent resistance seems highly unlikely. Democrats have quietly supported this seizure of power, labeling Clark's actions as 'troubling but necessary', all while President Hammons issues a silent show of support to his mentor and predecessor. President Clark has recently spoken to the nation via a nationwide Television address, speaking at length about the concerns expressed by many. In his speech, he stated his regret that he was forced to override the Union's Democratic foundation, but stated that the whims of the Establishment Parties left him with no other choice than to take decisive action. Congress, for the time being, has had its duties suspended, with an advisory council of Generals and other Technocratic advisors helming the nation for the time being. Clark has promised that a return to full and complete Democracy would be underway in the time being, but many aren't holding their breath. While he did his best to assure the nation, many are still deeply skeptical about the prospect of Clark's return, especially Conservatives, who have worried about Clark's promises of extensive Social Liberalism."

 heartlands.2.t:0 "General Clark Speaks to Congress"
 heartlands.2.d:0 "Among the most prominent opposition to McChrystal's unprecedented overthrow of the Hammons administration lies with Democrats in Congress. While they certainly prefer Clark's avowed Social Liberalism to the Conservatism of Rodham or god forbid the Paleocons, a Military Junta is still far from their desired form of government. William Jefferson Clinton, along with others such as Gary Hartpence and former Vice President Mark Pryor have made their opposition to Clark's seizure of power clear. In hopes of smoothing over tensions with the now-shuddered Legislative branch, General Clark has met with key Democratic members of Congress in order to secure their support. Bob Kerrey, already swayed by Clark's promises, has been instrumental in scoring support among the Democratic caucus, and has led to much of the Democratic Party accepting their new advisory role alongside President Clark, despite his own distrust of the Party. Recognizing both the Democratic Party and Unity Party as key planks of support, Clark has signalled an openness to granting concessions, and the Democrats in turn have worked alongside Clark to undo the Decentralization agenda of Former President Hammons, which has become a point of mutual contention for both Democrats and Clark."

 heartlands.3.d:0 "Thanks to generous encouragement from the President, a bill to clean up our nation's skies and waterways has flown through the remains of Congress. This bill, which arrived on the President's desk today, is one that cracks down on some of the Heartland's worst polluters. Hard limits on the four major pollutants have been introduced across the totality of the nation, strictly limiting the carbon output of major factories. In addition, strict punishment for ecological damage caused by runoff from farming have been introduced. The Heartlands, as a primarily Agrarian nation dependent on various fertilizers, has had a major problem with agricultural runoff in rivers and streams. Thanks to Clark's actions, the effort to clean up our environment has been codified, with a Carbon Cap and Trade System also being introduced alongside the clean Air and Water bill. While some caution that this bill may make creating the requisite military industry for Reunification difficult, Clark remains unswayed and has formally joined the long string of world leaders recognizing the fragile state of Earth's ecosystem, utilizing his status as a de-facto dictator to introduce strict limits on pollutants and Greenhouse Gas Emissions."

 heartlands.4.d:0 "In a move celebrated by Democrats and Clark Loyalists alike, the President has formally declared the legalization of Homosexual Marriage within the Union of the Heartlands. This order, formally signed today in a grand ceremony attended by members of the LGBT community, has made the Heartlands one more nation in the Former United States to recognize Gay Marriage. This move, motivated both by Clark's staunchly Social Liberal stances, and as a way to ensure that the spouses of all enlisted men and women regardless of gender and sex are entitled to their due benefits, now seeks to allow all Heartlanders to marry regardless of assigned sex. While Social Conservatives have been in an uproar over the news, declaring it to be a slippery slope and an attack on Christianity in the Former United States, they have little leeway to stop Clark from implementing his agenda. Fortunately, polls have indicated widespread support for this move, even in typically Conservative areas, with Clark's military motivations playing a large role in the chipping away of the Heartland's latent homophobia. Already hundreds of same-sex couples are moving to marry under the new laws, with some LGBT Americans in neighboring states where Same Sex marriage remains illegal choosing to relocate to the Heartlands because of the new laws.

 heartlands.5.d:0 "Healthcare remains a popular point of contention for many within the Union, and across the wider United States. The exact nature of healthcare remains spotty throughout what was once the USA, with the Heartlands standing out as a nation in which Healthcare has made little to no significant advances in the area since the days of Reagan. Clark, who himself stood out among his Centrist colleagues for his outspoken support of Universal Healthcare, long found his plans to introduce a system of Socialized Medicine stonewalled by Congress. Thankfully, Congress is no longer an issue, with the institution being de-facto shuttered ever since the coup, and the remains of Congress now unflinchingly loyal to the President's whims. Under Clark's orders, a new system of Canadian-style Universal Healthcare has been formally introduced, replacing the previous patchwork of independent Medicare systems used by only certain individual states, with many particularly Conservative areas having no Public options to speak of. Now, all Heartlanders, regardless of their enlisted status, have access to premium care - even if soldiers are entitled to additional advantages such as free dental and vision care. These benefits will hopefully roll out to all Heartlanders some time in the far future."

But now, Americans, with their mouths agape, have at last seen that the unlikelyest outcome, a unification via the Heartlands, has in fact become a reality. David has indeed defeated Goliath, slaying the forces of Communism, Socialism and GOP Republicanism, despite their seemingly superior numbers and industry. Now, President [ROOT.GetLeader] has taken the opportunity to speak to a divided nation - now a nation no longer divided by borders, but divided by ideology and class. Speaking from the bullet hole-ridden interior of the Oval Office, where Ronald Reagan once spoke of America's dissolution on that fateful day in 1987, [ROOT.GetLeader] has declared, a tone of triumph in every word, that the American Experiment has returned. The doubters have been proved wrong, and as we sweep decades of cobwebs and rat urine out of the abandoned husk of America's once-center of power, the people of this great nation can once more prosper, not as strangers divided by borders, but as Americans. From Sea to Shining Sea, the United States lives once more. From the ash, like a Phoenix, we have risen. While there is still much to be done before we can truly live up to the legacy of the old America, the American people have at last been able to look to their future with a certain cautious sense of hope."

 heartlands.7.d:0 "With Wesley Clark being sworn in as the first President of the United States since Reagan, decisions have been made to restore the sanctity of former American institutions. Clark has formally abolished the Heartlander Congress, restoring in its stead the United States House of Representative and Senate. However these institutions have been changed significantly from their pre-Collapse incarnations, as any newly-elected Congressman can attest. Unlike the old Senate, Senators are no longer directly elected, with only one of a State's two Senators being elected - the other being appointed directly by the President. This move has been made by Clark to ensure the 'loyalty' of all Senators to the United States, and to solve what Clark viewed as part of the undoing of the original USA - the disorderly Congress more dedicated to their own betterment than the betterment of the nation. As well, in the House, 1/3rd of the seats have been set aside for apolitical military officials, officials who are almost guaranteed to skew towards President Clark politically. While the new Congress has been given a substantial measure of freedom, at the end of the day President Clark maintains final say on all matters of policy, with many accusing this new Congress of only working as a rubbers-stamp for Clark's expansive domestic agenda."

This moment was seen by many as the absolute zenith of the United States, and given the 20 years following the Moon Landing, it's hard to blame people for thinking so. Clark, himself fascinated by all manner of next-level military technology, has prodded officials within the military to start thinking beyond the limits of traditional scientific endeavors. Clark, often speaking about the need to break beyond 'Light Speed', has now ordered the investment of millions in the pursuit of technology to move beyond light speed, stating that 'I still believe in e=mc², but I can't believe that in all of human history, we'll never ever be able to go beyond the speed of light to reach where we want to go', further elaborating that 'I've argued with physicists about it, I've argued with best friends about it. I just have to believe it. It's my only faith-based initiative'. Physicists have doubted the President's claim, throwing cold water on the possibility of his grandiose vision. However, with a windfall of money going into NASA's coffers, most within the scientific community are content with allowing Clark to dream, so long as the spigot is kept open."

With Speaker Tancredo handing control over to Merlin Miller, many Heartlanders are understandably nervous. Calling representatives to a formal State of the Union address, Miller has formally outlined his plans for the future of [MWA.GetName]. Ranting against the evils of Abortion, Homosexuality and Communism, Miller promised a government focused on protecting the American Majority, closing the borders to the outside world and their wicked ideologies. Notably, Tancredo was absent from this address, as rumours a rift between the two spread throughout Denver. With the Military under Miller's command and a new Loyal Congress under his command, any challenges to Miller's rapidly-consolidating rule have become increasingly unlikely, with most writing off Miller as having consolidated complete control over the now-former Union of the Heartlands. With his 'Eagles' Paramilitary by his side throughout the address, Miller's speech has been one of strength and authority, even as the Heartland's few Libertarians, Liberals, and Socialists protest against the House's usurpation of President Hammons. Miller himself has instructed the Eagles and local Law Enforcement to make quick work of foreign agitators."

Rumour has spread that Tancredo believes he made a mistake in offering the Presidency to Miller, instead of a more moderate Paleoconservative stalwart such as long-time ideologue for the movement, Pat Buchanan. While Mr. Tancredo fully supports Miller's xenophobic and pro-Christian agenda, Tancredo apparently has clarified his apprehensions about Miller's more anti-Semetic positions. To clear the air, President Miller has formally approached the Speaker in good faith to discuss their differences. The matter of Miller's apparent anti-Semetism has been a great concern to many within the Paleoconservative movement. While it is unknown what exactly transpired in the meeting, the two titans of Heartlander power exited the meeting on better terms, with Tancredo publicly supporting President Miller and denying any reports he was having second thoughts about his decision to hand the Presidency to Miller. With all doubts about the relationship between the President and Congress quashed, the Chairman can at last return to his hard work of preparing for a restoration of true American values."

A biopic about Charles Lindbergh, starring Randy Quaid, has formally gone into production, detailing Lindbergh's efforts to keep America out of World War Two and save America from Anglo-Zionist tyranny. Equal part fact and myth, the film starts with Lindbergh's own early life, service as an Air Mail pilot, and later flight across the Atlantic ocean. With an exact replica of the Spirit of St. Louis under their belt, this part of the film has been praised for its historical accuracy by even the most Liberal of film critics. The second act focuses on Lindbergh's battle to keep America from sending young men to die in the European conflict, detailing his involvement with the America First Committee and at last setting the record straight about the Lone Eagle's heroism. The end of the film features a personal message from President Miller, stating that Lindbergh was a hero who tried in vain to keep America's sons from being sacrificed in a European War, asking the viewer the question if Europe is truly better thanks to American efforts to defeat the Germans. The latter half of the film has understandably been controversial, with Roger Ebert himself ripping the film as a 'Nazi Fairy Tale'."

Before his ascension to the Presidency, the Heartlander film industry was nothing more than a footnote, however now that Miller controls the purse strings, he has formally funnelled millions of dollars into creating a brand new Hollywood here in the Heartlands. With Hollywood largely abandoned, now only used for rinky-dink propaganda films starring no-name Communist actors, Miller has the perfect opportunity to create a new cinema industry free from the Zionist values of Hollywood. Prominent actor Mel Gibson has himself flown in from Australia to star in the next blockbuster films coming out of the Heartlands, with the actor publicly coming to support President Miller's crusade against Zionist infiltration. Already new movies are being planned, movies which tell the brave struggle of Americans against the forces of Communism and Liberalism.

As well, certain portions of Habeas Corpus have been overridden to prevent clogs in the justice system due to the expedited arrests. This move has both expected supporters and detractors, with supporters pointing to the Fed Police's work in clearing out rural havens of criminal activity, while others argue that the Police themselves have become criminals. Indeed, the new Federal Police force is deeply linked with the Eagles Paramilitary, themselves credibly accused of banditry. As well, local law enforcement officials have been known to disobey their own laws and run rural areas like local fiefdoms, something which shows no signs of slowing under [MWA.GetLeaderr]'s rule.

This new Congress, composed of the House of Representatives and the Senate, is to be populated exclusively by true Americans. Foreign born and dual-citizens have been barred from holding office in this new Congress, as well as non-Christians, due to Miller's promotion of Christianity as the new USA's sole state religion. This move has been a controversial one, especially among Liberals and Communists, who have accused Miller of using this Congress as a rubber-stamp for his 'Fascist' agenda. Miller refutes these claims, stating that all 'True Americans' regardless of ideology are free to be elected to the new Congress - even if extensive Gerrymandering makes the election of opposition figures difficult. While some within Miller's camp have denounced the restoration of 'Free' elections, stating it's a pathway to Judeo-Communist rule, Miller has already declared his distance from some of the radicals in his caucus."

As seeming revenge for Ashbrook's commitment to true Conservative values, the Reagan wing of the GOP willingly threw Ashbrook under the bus, turning America's fate over to Communist stooges. Years later, Reagan's own incompetence has proven to be the death-knell of the United States. Had Ashbrook's vision of true Conservatism survived, perhaps the United States would still be here today. Instead the crooked legacy of Reagan still remains, continued in the Southern Remnants who cling to the lie of Ashbrook's guilt - when in fact Ronald Reagan is the one guilty.

Fulani, despite her sincerely-held Socialist beliefs, has joined up with Buchanan's Isolationist crusade, and while Fulani may have her issues with Buchanan's staunch Social Conservatism, she has nonetheless remained a staunch supporter of the President. Fulani herself has been accused of racism against Latinos, Asians, Jews, and ironically, other African-Americans. Previous Socialist allies have denounced Fulani as a fraud for her choices to associate with Mr. Buchanan, with claims of racism against Fulani being amplified due to her decision.

The consensus among figures such as William Clinton is that Buffett is a preferable alternative to Koch, who was set to assume power anyway due to a failure of the peaceful transfer of power. Buffett, for his part, has promised a slough of reforms to help assist the economy, with the majority of his speech before Congress consisting of business terms.

Most notably, same-sex marriage has been legalized throughout the nation, something that has been a cause of celebration for members of the LGBT community across America. While many figures within the Democratic Party have stood opposed to such policy, mostly as a matter of political convenience, Buffett's status as a de-facto Dictator has allowed him to push for a much broader social agenda, something which many Democrats, aside from the most Conservative amongst the Blue Dog caucus, are more than content with accepting.

With a new tax code on the books, a radical redistribution of wealth is to be underway, with Buffett himself set to have his taxes radically increased, something which the President himself has taken in strides. As well, inheritance taxes have been increased - something which Buffett defended by stating 'When you get rid of the estate tax, you're basically handing over command of the country's resources to people who didn't earn it. It's like choosing the 2020 Olympic team by picking the children of all the winners at the 2000 Games'.

With Republicans in control of the 'People's Chamber', Buffett has been presented with a dilemma. To secure further funding for the Government, it is necessary to find compromise with Congress, however doing so would put his extensive agenda at risk. Vice President Clinton has suggested attempting to compromise with Speaker Barrasso, offering up Buffett's planned Balanced-Budget amendment as a possible compromise resolution to secure funding, while others such as Tom Daschle support simply utilizing Buffett's extensive authority as President to secure funding for himself.

Yeah, yeah, now you’ve got the incentives in the right place, right?', a statement which the President ended in a hearty laugh. While originally a joke, this proposal has rapidly gained widespread support among Heartlanders, with the President himself formally stating his full support for its full implementation. The Republican-controlled House, which has often chided Buffett for high spending on several areas, especially healthcare, has fully supported this radical new proposal, with speaker John Barrasso stating that such a proposal would be paramount to keeping government spending at realistic levels. While such a radical proposal would typically die in committee due to the fact that the people who would have to pass such a law are the same people who would lose their jobs, widespread public support, combined with some light intimidation from President Buffett has scared Congress into supporting the act, sending it sailing through both houses of Congress.

Indeed, Clinton's new Federalist bent is broadly supported by most Heartlanders, particularly those inhabiting urban areas who have frequently seen their needs ignored in favour of the countryside, with Hammons' policy of rural favoritism being the contributing force to the failure of his Presidency. Clinton has called for a 'Second Constitutional Convention' or sorts to iron out the details of our new, semi-Centralized government, with Colorado supporting the carving out of Denver to be a separate Federal District similar to the old Washington D.C. Federal district in the former United States. Among Heartlanders, the only group which stands in opposition to this policy is our nation's agrarian communities, with Farmers in particular despising Clinton for his policies to centralize the Union - and to cut the generous grants received by the Agricultural sector."

President Clinton, sometimes ironically and sometimes sincerely has been labeled as the 'First Black President' for a variety of reason; from his impoverished background to his talent in playing the Saxaphone. While the African-American community remains divided on whether they consider Clinton to be one of them, he still enjoys very high support levels amongst this demographic, with polls estimating 76% approval of the President among African-Americans. With the Racist policies of the old Remnants banished, Clinton can at last secure the dream of Dr. King, who himself has broken with his reclusive streak to meet with President Clinton recently."

Speaking to Congress for the first time since assuming office, President Hillary Rodham has outlined her plans for the next four years. In her speech, Rodham reaffirmed the Agrarian values the Union was founded on, while also promising to end the extensive decentralization policies implemented by the Hammons administration, a line which elicited a deathly glare from Former President Hammons, who sat in the audience along with all living former Presidents of the Heartlands. Rodham's ascension is seen by many as the beginning of the end of the Heartland's woes, and with approval of the former administration still hovering at around twenty three percent, many have already declared Rodham to be the nation's savior simply by the virtue of not being Hammons. Despite Rodham's status as a remarkably Liberal Conservative, opposition from the right still remains strong.

Rodham herself has seen the end of Decentralization as an opportunity to expand her own power, with Hammons' administration rendering the Presidency basically useless. The formal end of Hammons Decentralization has now affirmed the President as the highest authority within the Union, with the Congress and the States formally being subordinated by the President in her latest edict. While Rodham still supports the rights of the individual states to decide their own individual policies, they will only be able to do so so long as their efforts don't come at the cost of national unity. WHile many, both within the Democratic Party and the Paleoconservative movement have decried Clinton's expansion of executive power as tantamount to establishing a Heartlander dictatorship, polls have shown that the majority of Heartlanders support the President's effort to expand Executive power, as proposals to gut Presidential authority seen as unshakably tied to the Hammons administration."

Today, Rodham has met with several high-profile thought leaders in the world of Moderate Conservatism in Canada, particularly Donald Trump, an American émigré who has resided in Canada ever since the Great Collapse. Rodham and Trump have found much ideological common ground, with Trump describing the President as 'Undeniably the best choice for all Americans'. While meeting with Rodham, Trump reminisced about his early life in the United States, and stated that while he still has a great deal of love for his birth country, he has grown to consider himself as wholly Canadian throughout the years.

Had it not been for Rockefeller's pervasive influence after backing Rhodes, Rodham may not be aligned with the Conservative movement today, her mind lost to the siren call of Liberalism. Years later, Rodham now stands as the last in a long line of Moderate Conservatives. The splintered GOP, now dominated by the Nixon-Ashbrook line of influence kept alight in the South, is as good as dead. The Party's corpse was corrupted and puppeteered by sinister forces. Rodham views herself as the last true Republican, standing against the pollution of the Ashbrook years and the failures of the Reagan Years, instead keeping true to the Rockefellerian tradition of old.

Now, Rodham has sought to return the favour, appearing alongside Mr. Dole and his wife Elizabeth to present Bob Dole with the Heartlander Presidential Medal of Freedom. Dole, along with his wife, have remained key advisors to President Clinton, with Mrs. Dole being one of the key figures in Rodham's own brand of Conservative Feminism. Despite undoing many of Hammons' reforms, Rodham has maintained the Agrarian character of the Union, in keeping with Dole's vision, something which has brought many previously-skeptical Conservative figures such as Christopher Christie over to Rodham's camp. In a speech to the nation, Rodham has declared that Dole 'Represents the unshakable character of the Heartlands' and that she was proud to have his endorsement in the next election. Dole has accepted this medal with honour, and even stood up from his wheelchair to shake the President's hand.

Rodham-friendly interests have been snapping up American media at breakneck speed, as voices critical to her administration are slowly shut out by the countless Americans who rightfully hail Rodham as their savior. Some detractors have claimed that the President is building a personality cult, with flags, posters, mugs, bumper stickers and other memorabilia bearing the President's name appearing across the nation.

While some have cautioned that a restoration of Hammons' policy is a ticket to disaster, it is clear from the results of last election that the people now stand with Hammons.

Hammons, defending his own legacy and stating his efforts were driven by disdain for the Authoritarian policies of other American regimes, has been met with cheers across the nation; even in urban areas that bitterly opposed Hammons during his own Presidency.

Despite some measure of opposition within the GOP, particularly from Rodham and loyalists such as Rubio, Brownback's victory in a Religion-heavy campaign, utilizing the moral panic about Clinton's increasingly Liberal Social Policy, has had the effect of uniting the GOP behind the President.

Overall the opinion in Denver is split, with some beginning to openly push for restoring Hammons to a second non-consecutive Term, which would be a first in Heartlander History. Throughout the halls of power in Denver, figures within the Unity Party speak of Hammon's potential return in excited tones, especially given the fact that Hammons' approval ratings outpace [MWA.GetLeader]'s by almost 16 points.

As the polls close across the Heartlands, it appears that the Party to gain control of both houses of Congress, and thus go on to serve as Clark's official Legislative backer is..."

 heartlands_diplo.1.d:0 "The Government in [MWA.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has formally approached our nation with an offer of unification. Ever since the Texan conflict the United States has been shifting rapidly, with major claimants now making moves to retake what they see as their 'Rightful Territory'. The Heartlands, seen by many as not a serious contender for unification, has approached [ROOT.GetLeader] with an offer of 'peaceful' unification, promising some measure of autonomy for our nation if we accept. While most are adamantly against forfeiting our freedom, others have pondered the merits of the [MWA.GetAdjective] offer, especially considering their status as the American unifier with the most decentralized and localist administration.

The Heartlands, as a small, mostly agricultural nation with a distinct Separatist and Localist bent, has perhaps the weakest claim to the US mantle of any post-American nation claiming themselves to be the inheritors of the old USA's legacy. Indeed, it came as a shock to many in Ottawa that the Heartlands even considered themselves to be the true successor to the United States. The Heartlands, as they stand, can be argued to be the most 'Democratic' of the American claimants, as dubious as it may be, however they are also undoubtedly the weakest. Their cause, as strong as it may be, also may be an entirely lost one - with any aid we send them possibly being funnelled into the ether once a more powerful force shows up on their doorstep. On the other hand, with the right support, the Heartlands could be shaped into a formidable force in the Former United States. What shall we do?"

Prime Minister [CAN.GetLeader] has hailed the efforts of our government as a modern-day struggle for emancipation, and has already begun whipping up support within the House of Commons for extensive aid towards our cause.

In a speech, [CAN.GetLeader] hailed the Heartlander cause as being one of Freedom and Liberty - while publicly refusing to support our claims to being the true successor of the United States. Similar Canadian policy has been reported by our neighbors, with rumour being that Canada is aiming to protect most of the non-aligned American nations. In keeping with Canada's policy of quiet support for the Heartlander cause, CSIS agents have already arrived in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], carrying with them top-of-the-line intelligence about our enemies.

Whispers in Ottawa have spread that the Government of Prime Minister [CAN.GetLeader] is preparing to throw their support behind the Remnants in Atlanta in the battle to restore the United States, while others guess that Canada is simply going to maintain the policy of Neutrality in America that they have had for the last 20 years. Regardless, this is bad news for us, and is just one of many setbacks in the Heartlander struggle to restore American Freedom. Shunned by the Canadians, the Heartlands will have to look inward if we wish to win the battle for America's soul."

 heartlands_flavour.1.d:0 "The fall of the United States has had a particularly hard effect on small towns across America. As millions Americans moved to greener pastures, be them in Canada or the big city, countless once-thriving towns across America have found themselves emptied out. Ghost towns not scatter America's landcape, haunting remnants of once-thriving communities. However in the Northern part of the State of Nebraska, there lies one small town that teeters just on the edge, for the small town of Monowi, which means 'Flower' in an undidentified Native American language, is the only incorporated village on the Former United States to have a population of just one. The town's sole resident, Elsie Eiler, also serves as Monowi's Mayor, who in her capacity in the office issues a liquor liscence to herself to operate the town's bar. In addition to a bar, the town also boasts a library, 'Rudy's Library', a collection of approximately 5,000 volumes established in memory of the Mayor's late husband. The town's population, while once an impressive 150 people at its peak, had dropped to a total population of just two, consisting of a married couple, Rudy and Elsie Eiler. The death of Rudy Eiler further dropped the population to one. This small village remains a curious oddity in the grand scheme of post-American politics, and serves as a reminder of the countless once-thriving communities devestated by the Great Collapse. "

 heartlands_flavour.2.t:0 "The Great Navy of the State of Nebraska"
 heartlands_flavour.2.d:0 "One would not lie if they said that the majority of people, be it globally or even just in the former United States, don’t pay much attention to the state of Nebraska. As part of of the Midwest and the colloquial ‘flyover country’ - at least when planes still regularly flew from California to the Eastern seaboard - the Cornhusker State was left mostly to its own devices. Yet, as an important part of our Heartlander union Nebraska has its own peculiarities that should be recognized and cherished. As the only US state that can claim the ‘honor’ of being triply-landlocked (landlocked by other landlocked states, which themselves are landlocked), as well as water only constituting less than 1% of its area, it is no wonder that Nebraska does not have a storied legacy when it comes to maritime activities. That, however, does not mean that there were no seafaring or metaphorically naval aspects related to it throughout history. Be it the battleship USS Nebraska which sailed with the Great White Fleet, or the entire Omaha-class of cruisers - including the eponymous USS Omaha that captured the Nazi blockade runner SS Odenwald - the Nebraskan spirit has left a mark among the nautical chronicles.\n\nHands down the most peculiar institution related to the aforementioned spheres is represented by the concept of the Nebraska Admirals - a honorific, although more humorous, title akin to Kentucky Colonel. Tracing its origins back to 1931 and Lieutenant Governor Theodore W. Metcalfe, the commission in the Great Navy of the State of Nebraska was always related to prominent citizens in-and-outside of the Conrhuskher State who ‘contribute in some way to the state, promote the Good Life in Nebraska, and warrant recognition as determined by the Governor’. Ultimately, a non-profict called the Nebraska Admirals Association was established in 1986 with goals of ‘promoting Nebraska products, educational activities, awarding scholarships, promoting tourism, and providing support for ships and sailors in the United States Navy named after Nebraska-related entities’.\n\nAs the United States dissolved just a year after its creation, the NAA was also kept busy with helping to mitigate the calamitous impact of the Great Collapse on its home state, which it managed to do so relatively well. With backing of prominent inductees such as Warren Buffett or Former House Speaker Gerald Ford, the Great Navy and its commanders of ‘all officers, seamen, tadpoles and goldfish’ shall surely serve and improve Nebraska for decades to come."

 heartlands_flavour.3.t:0 "The Kansas City Situation"
 heartlands_flavour.3.d:0 "The Collapse of the United States has wreaked havoc on countless communities across America. The solidification of State Borders that people once crossed without issue for centuries has understandably divided both people and properties across the once-United States. There is no better example of this phenomenon than Kansas City - which despite its name, has the majority of its location across the border in Missouri. The City's status as being bisected by two States remained nothing but an odd bit of trivia, until Reagan's edict dissolving the United States, making Kansas and Missouri two separate entities. Ever since, Kansas City's status as a municipality bisected by two sovereign nations has been a bit of a problem, to say the least. The Border between East and West Kansas City has become akin to the situation between East and West Berlin, and while we do enjoy much more cordial relations with the ironically-named Union of Illinois than the West Germans enjoyed with the East before they were absorbed, the presence of a hard border still has raised untold complications with the denizens of KC. The leaders of Illinois and the Heartlands have negotiated a free travel zone within the City's boundaries, where Easterners can freely travel to the Missouri side, and vice-versa. However the legal grey area that is Kansas City has led to a truly terrifying rise in crime and smuggling, one which both the Kansas State and Illinois Federal Police forces have been unable to properly address due to the region's unique status. A legal tug-of-war and desire to pass the buck to the other side of the Border has kept Kansas City a haven of gang activity and drug dealing, and until a situation with the Illinoisan border is figured out permanently, it is likely that Kansas City will remain a hive of scum and villainy."

 heartlands_flavour.4.d:0 "When the United States fell, countless monuments to the glory of 'Old America' were left veritably abandoned as the nation they celebrated ceased to exist. Across the once-United States, scattered reminders of the nation that once was continue to dot the countryside, with some being torn down, others being maintained by those who still hold dear the dream of a United America, and others simply being left to rot. One such example of an American Monument left to rot is none other than Mount Rushmore. Rushmore, an iconic national park and monument to George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevent and Abraham Lincoln, has sat abandoned ever since the US National Parks Service was dissolved. Located in the sacred Black Hills, the concept for the sculpture was originally conceived by one Doane Robinson, with the sculpture work done by Gutzon Borglum. The construction of Rushmore was a storied ideal, with funding running out before the original design, which included complete torsos for the Presidents featured, being reduced to simply faces poking out of the mountainside, the granite remains from construction still visible below the heads of the Presidents. Following the Collapse of the United States, Rushmore has found itself abandoned, the park area overgrown with brush and weeds, and the faces on the mountains themselves damaged by erosion. Almost two decades of sitting abandoned has had quite the toll on the mountain and the surrounding area, with the colossal statue to Presidents of a now-dead nation, abandoned and sitting in the middle of nowhere being quite the eerie site. The local Sioux tribe has lobbied for the land to be returned, considering few Government agencies are willing to step in to save the monument. Some have even proposed tearing down the heads of the Presidents and returning the Mountainside to its previous state, however given our status as a claimant to the United States, many have proposed restoring the Monument to its former glory. The decision on what to do with the remains of Rushmore is undoubtedly going to be a controversial one. Congress is content in letting the status quo remain, however many are perfectly happy returning the land to the local Sioux nation, either as a means of recompense or simply to foist off maintenance of the area to them. What shall the final fate of this monument be?"

 heartlands_flavour.5.d:0 "Across the small towns that dot America, particularly in the Heartlands, there are giants. From the world's biggest Ball of Twine in Cawker City, Kansas, to the World's Largest Buffalo in Jamestown, East Dakota, to the World's Largest Beetle in Herkimer, Colorado, to the World's Largest Pair of Overalls in Grand Island, Nebraska, or even the World’s Largest Collection of the World’s Smallest Versions of the World’s Largest Things in Kansas, the American Heartlands have no shortage of interesting attractions. Of course, not all of the Heartland's many roadside attractions are in the form of a giant version of a mundane object, with the Carhenge, a replica England's Stonehenge made with vintage Automobiles spray-painted brown. Others include the Corn Palace in South Dakota and the Great Platte River Road Archway Monument in Nebraska. Of course, the Heartlands are not the only region in which the phenomenon of Roadside Attractions is present, with small towns across the post-United States, and even in Canada and Australia featuring these impressive works of small-town ingenuity. Unfortunately, the fall of the United States and rise of local warlords has caused countless of these attractions to fall into disrepair, with one such notable casualty being the Enchanted Highway in North Dakota, which was left abandoned after the majority of the State was taken over by Neo-Nazi militants. Despite the rise in lawlessness and chaos in America's hinterlands, countless families still opt to make the trek to see these impressive feats of engineering with their own eyes, snapping a few pictures and patronizing local businesses along the way. Indeed, as it seems, no amount of chaos or division can hamper America's love for their very own 'Big Things'."

 heartlands_flavour.6.d:0 "Mount Rushmore is not the only gargantuan statue in the State of South Dakota that has fallen into disrepair. In Custer County, South Dakota, along the infamous Black Hills, lies the Crazy Horse Memorial, an as-of-now unfinished memorial to Oglala Lakota warrior Crazy Horse, riding a horse and pointing to his tribal land. Originally commissioned by Henry Standing Bear, this statue was designed by Polish-American sculptor Korczak Ziolkowski to serve as an impressive testament to the local culture, in stark contrast to nearby Mount Rushmore, with Standing Bear writing to Ziolkowski that 'My fellow chiefs and I would like the white man to know that the red man has great heroes, too'. Construction of the sculpture began in 1948, and has been in progress ever since. The monument has sat unfinished for decades, with the project outliving both Henry Standing Bear and sculptor Korczak Ziolkowski, as his wife took over management of the project following his death in 1982. The fall of the United States has further complicated the status of the project, as private funding and interest for the project gradually ran out. Now, the Crazy Horse Memorial lies abandoned just like its twin Mount Rushmore, both standing as depressing testaments to the lost glories of what once was. The Government, ever eager to lift the spirits of the local populace and secure the loyalty of local Nations flirting with Separatism, has considered injecting some funds to at last finish the memorial, even if the Ziolkowski family themselves have often turned down Federal Funding, with many local bands also proposing that the funds be spent elsewhere on more essential projects instead. Indeed, many locals have more mixed thoughts on the monument, seeing it as either grotesque cultural appropriation and a mark of disrespect on the legacy of a man who had no intention of being glorified, even going so far as to avoid having his picture taken, or a scam by the Ziolkowski family that they have no intention of ever finishing. Still, finishing this monument after all these decades would be a tremendous PR victory, and would increase tourism in the area, further boosting the local economy. With only the face complete, and longtime manager Ruth Ziolkowski getting up in age, many estimate that time to finish the sculpture is dwindling. Shall we save it? Or leave it to decay just like Mt. Rushmore."

 heartlands_flavour.7.d:0 "It is no mystery that the Denver International Airport, flanked by the sight of the breathtaking Front Range of the Rocky Mountains and ironically situated closer to the city of Aurora, has been a topic of many a heated debate and conversation within the more conspiratorial-minded denizens of the former United States. From the seemingly Masonic connections to simply odd interior design decisions and details, the DIA has a certain aura emboldening the locals to weave extraordinary tales related to it.\n\nThe recent event would have been the same, if not for the suspicious activity preceding it, which came from the very skies above us. Local officials detected messages sent from an unidentified satellite, supposedly of pre-collapse origin. In a span of three hours, as if programmed to by an unknown force, the celestial object transferred data which read as ‘Cochetopa, Sisnaajini, Dzit Dit Gaii’ when decoded - the Navajo names for geographical landmarks which also feature on the floor of the airport.\n\nAfter a lull of two hours, a powerful explosion could be heard, yet not felt, coming from the underground baggage tunnels - another piece of the architecture scrutinized by conspiracy theories. When the authorities arrived at the scene, they could find no evidence nor sign of any damage to the structure. The whole event would have been quickly forgotten if not for a local homeless man, identifying himself only as Clay, becoming a sensation for the local newspapers and TV stations.\n\nThe man’s claims are nothing short of baffling and ridiculous, telling of a group of cloaked men wearing rings with red crosses transporting a glowing orb of ‘Levantine origin’ to the deepest levels of the Denver International Airport. Purportedly, the same group arrived on the scene of the incident following the explosion and ‘erased all evidence of their lies’, carrying body bags out, evacuating precious equipment, and removing the broken remains of the orb.\n\nEven if the eye-witness account of this ‘Clay’ is simply unbelievable, conspiracists from across the Heartlands and neighboring regions are adamant the DIA has, once again, hidden clear evidence of a global conspiracy."

 heartlands_flavour.8.d:0 "With Reagan’s assassination and the slow death of the American experiment underway, much of punk’s fury gave way to a deeper emotional deluge. In Washington D.C., bands like Rites of Spring, Embrace, and Beefeater pushed post-hardcore into more emotional territory, soon coined emocore. When the government finally collapsed in 1987, the scene scattered, but its ideas travelled through zines, tapes, and DIY tours into the successor states.\n\nAcross these fragmented regions, emo mutated into new forms. Crossing the borders of Illinois and the Heartlands, the sound broke from punk entirely, drawing instead on indie rock and math rock to express the quiet loneliness and emptiness emblematic of the mid-90s. From Cap’n Jazz and Braid in Illinois, to Christie Front Drive in Denver, The Get Up Kids in Kansas City, Cursive in Nebraska, and Rainer Maria in Wisconsin, a generation of musicians captured the small, personal sadness in the era's poverty. The movement reached its emotional peak with American Football, whose twinkly guitars and soft, weary vocals defined late-90s Midwest emo before the scene faded into silence in the early 2000s.\n\nIn recent years, the sound has reignited in Pennsylvania and Chicago with groups like Modern Baseball, Into It Over It, and Tigers Jaw giving a new voice to America’s anxieties. Spreading westward from the American People’s Commonwealth, bands such as Snowing, Algernon Cadwallader, Mom Jeans, and Brave Bird helped carry the revival across the Midwest. The renewed excitement helped bring American Football back together, and after their reunion shows in Illinois, the band’s long-awaited performances have finally reached Denver. With a new album in the works and what many are calling an emo revival in full swing, there's an undeniable excitement in the local music scene."

 heartlands_flavour.9.d:0 "The outlaw biker scene is well-known to all in the post-United States. Nowhere else is the influence of Biker culture felt more than in Sturgis, South Dakota. The medium-sized town normally wouldn't raise any eyebrows, however every year on the first week of August, thousands of bikers congregate in a tremendous rally known throughout America. While attendance has dropped off significantly following the collapse of the United States, the Sturgis Rally remains a prominent local festival... however as it seems, it has also taken on a darker connotation following 1987. Sturgis, which sits on the border with Neo-Nazi occupied Montana, has become a haven of crime and militias, with local biker gangs continuing to have dealings with the White Supremacist Government in Great Falls. Indeed, 'Outlaw Biker' culture has taken on a more literal form as local warlords ride in much of the lawless countryside of the Heartlands, further causing the disintegration of Social Order as these bikers smuggled in weaponry and narcotics in from Montana. While not all those who make the pilgrimage to Sturgis are affiliated with the various Neo-Nazi biker gangs loyal to Montana, the event has become a recruiting ground for those who do, with the first week of August being a veritable bloodbath as various Biker Gangs and Montana-aligned militias Duke it out on the streets. Local law enforcement has been powerless to stand up to this, being veritably outmanned and outgunned at every step. With the lawlessness of the late 2010s slowly fading away, many have wondered if we should at last shut down this festival and restore order to the surrounding area, no matter how much bloodshed it may require. Taking on the Bikers would most likely require extensive intervention from both Police Forces and the National Guard, and many wonder if a simpler solution would be to just turn a blind eye to the criminal activities underway in Sturgis."

 heartlands_flavour.10.d:0 "The self-professed \"Doctor of Journalism,\" Hunter S. Thompson, has published his new book - 'Alien Nation'. Written deep within his \"fortified compound\" at Owl Farm in Woody Creek, Colorado, the book emerges from a gonzo haze of alcohol, cocaine, prescription drugs, automatic weapons, political obsession, and relentless paranoia. Blending an examination of emerging Heartland culture intertwined with Thompson’s own lived anecdotes, it offers a uniquely fractured portrait of the America that survived the nation’s shattering.\n\nThompson first entered the public consciousness with The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved, a savage indictment of American decline disguised as sports journalism. The piece captured the grotesque excess of the ruling class against the backdrop of the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War, unfolding in the new decade. With Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Thompson expanded this vision, documenting a profound sense of betrayal following Lyndon B. Johnson’s Southern Compromise, the collapse of liberal idealism, and the slow death of the hippie movement.\n\nThe 1972 election marked Thompson’s sharpest political focus in the wake of an unsuccessful run for Pitkin County Sheriff under a 'Freak Power' Ticket. Covering the Ashbrook–Wallace race, he framed the contest as a choice between a \"reformed segregationist\" and a \"manic bloodsucker with a stick in his ass,\" crystallizing his loathing for the political system and the wider national disillusionment. By the late 1970s and into the 1980s, Thompson retreated fully to Owl Farm, becoming less a roaming journalist and more a besieged commentator. His output slowed, but his voice grew sharper and more embittered. When Reagan announced the formal end of the American experiment, it merely vindicated the fatalism that had defined his work all along. \n\nWith the new century, Thompson found himself reenergised, determined to help shape a renewed Heartland culture that might finally fulfil the broken promises of the hippie movement and grassroots freak power. Through new columns, reprints, and public appearances, he reinserted himself into the national conversation. Kingdoms of Fear, published in 2003, embodied this late-career turn: a memoir fusing the madness of the successor states with stories from Thompson’s youth. Now, his second memoir, 'Alien Nation', continues in this vein, mocking the new leadership that followed the Hammons era and reflecting on his unlikely friendship with paleocon hard-ass Pat Buchanan, whom he first met on the Campaign Trail in ’72."

Of those Separatist projects, some of them still exist, while others have found themselves subsumed by larger national projects. Here in the Heartlands, formed as a unification of Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado, and the remaining Dakotas, Separatist feelings have typically been few and far between - with not many people typically eager to jump on the bandwagon of 'Kansas Independence'. However as it seems, a new Separatist movement has taken hold among our nation's Indigenous population. The so-called 'Republic of Lakotah', the brainchild of one Russell Means, has been founded in the territories of South Dakota and Nebraska. Means, himself claiming to be a facilitator between Lakotah and the Heartlander Government, has stated that the local tribes were unilaterally withdrawing treaties with Denver, claiming them to be null and void ever since the collapse of the United States, and forming a provisional government. In addition to claiming much of our own territory, they have also laid claim to several areas currently occupied by the Neo-Nazi controlled 'nation' of Montana. The legal status of the Reservations is an infinitely complicated matter, especially so since the collapse of the United States, and while one could argue that they are well within their legal right to secede from what they view as an 'Illegitimate Government', as it stands, all of the tribes within claimed Lakotah territory have rebuked Means' efforts to establish an independent Republic of Lakotah, with many Tribal Governments being entirely unaware of the proposed Republic. As it stands, the chance of Lakotah actually succeeding is low, as even though Native American Separatism is nothing now, the physical location of this proposed 'Lakotah' being so close to the armed and dangerous government of Montana, where non-whites exist in a living hell, makes many far more comfortable under Denver's protection."

 heartlands_flavour.12.d:0 "'GOD HATES AMERICA', and 'THANK GOD FOR DEAD SOLDIERS' reads the banners unfurled across the most infamous and loathed Church in the once-United States: the Westboro Baptist Church. Pastor Fred Phelps, long having distanced himself from the ravings of his once-congregation, stands as a figure who has claimed the visage of a reformed man, but whose actions paint a picture that is anything but. The Collapse of the United States, caused the once rabid preacher to take more 'Mainstream' positions - while still refusing to back down against the most outspoken views of the Christian Right. Yet still, a fringe faction of his congregation continued his Crusade, entrenching themselves deeper and deeper into their own insanity. From organizing picket lines on the funerals of slain soldiers to publicly burning the old American flag, the WBC has been known across the nation as an insane cult. Phelps himself no longer holds any connection to the congregation, instead moving to support more mainstream forms of Christian Nationalism such as Merlin Miller's Isolationist Party and various militias. While some have decried Phelps's distancing from the church he helped found as a shrewd political ploy due to the establishment's atrocious PR, others have estimated that it's a result of Phelps developing dementia, something which Phelps himself fervently denies. Others have also cast doubt on whether he has truly abdicated these views, or is simply holding his tongue on his most wretched beliefs. Regardless, it seems that Phelps's new 'Moderate' turn has only made the man more dangerous, as his new 'Congregation' stands more energized than ever, ready to implement Phelp's agenda, no longer constrained by the Church's most sordid reputation. Thankfully, most are not buying Phelp's rebrand, and with much of his ideals already occupied by the niche of the Paleoconservatives, it seems that Phelps is unlikely to gain power in the Heartlands. However, beyond our borders, some time in a future that Phelps may very well be alive to see due to his sudden embrace of traditional medicine, we can never be so sure..."

 heartlands_flavour.14.d:0 "Among the flat planes of the agricultural states of the Midwest one can find many stories people told themselves for amusement and quick passage of time. One of the most peculiar ones concerns the sleepy community of Stull, Kansas and its cemetery, which, according to local legends, serves as none other than one of the seven gates to hell itself. According to these tales, either sleeping on a grave of a young boy who died in a field burning accident, or heading down a mysterious staircase in the basement of the haunted ruins of the Evangelical Emmanuel Church, will transport the unfortunate thrill-seeker directly to Satan’s domain.\n\nThe origin of Stull as a transitory stage between terrestrial reality and the darkness below is relatively recent, for it was first suggested in the 1974 issue of the University Daily Kansan newspaper. Even so, many folks erroneously claimed that the malevolent spirits started to dwell in Stull as far back as the 1850s when one of its mayors was killed (despite the community never having such an office) or even further back with supposed witch trial hangings, a rather unlikely tale as the community was established under the name Deer Creek by Pennsylvania Dutch settlers only in 1857, already beyond the famed gallowing of sorcerers. The tallest of recent tales associated with Kansas’ Beelzebub's gate comes from 1980, as it was then that Pope John Paul II is said to have rescheduled and redirected his flight across America to avoid the ‘unholy ground’ of Stull. Many conspiracists, thus, extrapolated that the Pope’s knowledge of the location’s infernal secret invited demonic forces to assassinate him in the following year.\n\nNonetheless, the quiet Kansan cemetery has attracted many youths and vandals, especially during the Halloween season, which used to strain the local sheriff’s resources until most of them abandoned their expeditions following the Great Collapse of 1987. Yet, with the Heartlands achieving enough prominence to allow for people to rediscover lost aspects of America, the excitingly sinister folk tale has once again enamored anyone who comes across it. Be warned, adventurer, for if you decide to venture into Stull prepare yourself to see the Devil himself. In such situation, do not expect anything less than the possibility that ‘the voices of the dead will strangle you while evil spirits carve out your innards."

 heartlands_flavour.15.d:0 "Drugs. Everybody loves them, whether they admit it or not. Reagan's War on Drugs was a failure, Drugs coming out as the undisputed winner the moment he announced the end of the Federal Government. Ever since the end of the DEA, Drugs have been flowing like wine across what was once the United States. Mexico and the Northwest in particular have been potent sources of narcotics flowing into America. Mexico, long considered to be a de-facto 'Narco State', has been under the de-facto control of the Cartels ever since the US fell, with the widespread lawlessness in the post-United States allowing their market to expand tenfold without anyone to stop them, allowing Cartel operations to entrench themselves on both sides of the borders. The Neo-Nazi 'nations' of Lincoln and Montana meanwhile have also been dabbling in the Drug Trade, with the White Supremacist militias that occupy the territory dealing in Heroin and Methamphetamine distribution to help fund their Militias and other illicit operations. Partly due to the state-sanctioned status of these dealings, and partly due to the rural character of the nation, these underground drug-making facilities have been exceedingly hard to track, as Cartels entrench themselves deep into the Montana wilderness. Due to the difficulty in tracing the origin of these drugs, countless less-than-safe batches have been dealt, leading to countless overdoses or other drug-related deaths across the Heartlands. However not all dealings with Drugs within the Heartlands are illicit. Colorado has taken steps to legalize Marijuana, making them one of the first areas in the post-United States to do so. So far their legalization experiment has been a rousing success, with millions of dollars in new revenue created by this move, all while the Black Market hold over the Cannabis market is irrevocably broken. This has brought up heated debate over Drug Policy, with some arguing that legalization of narcotics is the way forward, while others defend their criminalization as protecting Heartlanders from dangerous substances."

Unlike those who inhabit gilded mansions, Warren Buffett lives in a remarkably modest house in Omaha's suburbs. Ever since assuming the Presidency, Buffett has forfeited his salary as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, and went further to slash the salary of the President's office by 10%. As well, Buffett has refused an official Air Force plane, instead opting to fly commercial. As well, it has been reported that President Buffett, does not carry his own cell phone, does not have a computer at his desk, and drives his own car instead of opting for a motorcade In staunch contrast to most politicians and/or political figures, Buffett keeps himself occupied by strumming on the ukulele, of which he is an avid player, or playing Bridge, a game on which Buffett has stated 'Bridge is such a sensational game that I wouldn't mind being in jail if I had three cellmates who were decent players and who were willing to keep the game going twenty-four hours a day'. Additionally, Buffett is known as a fan and supporter of Nebraska Football, with that being just about the only one of his hobbies that has a price tag over two digits. Buffett's own focus on modest living is something that all within our nation can take example from, especially those within the upper crust who have long maintained exorbitant ways of life. Champagne and Caviar have made way for Dairy Queen Ice Cream Bars, and Coca Cola, which Buffett reportedly consumes one of per day. For the President, refusing to spend his fortune on frivolous endeavours is not a quirk of Buffett, but rather a key tenet in his plan for America, a way in which all can feel more connected to their leadership, and a way to teach those in power that the finer things are not always everything in life."

 heartlands_flavour.17.d:0 "The Atlantic Incident has been perhaps one of the 21st Century's greatest unsolved mysteries. On a cold day in 2005, some of the world's most foremost Anti-Communist celebrities gathered on an Atlantic Ocean cruise liner. From cultural figures such as rapper 'Ice Cube' and filmmaker Sylverster Stallone to musicians such as Gene Simmons, to athletes such as Mike Tyson and wrestler Hulk Hogan, to titans of industry such as Michael Eisner, countless great lives were lost on that tragic day. Who was behind this event? Nobody knows for sure. The KGB is commonly blamed, a conclusion came to by both neutral observers and the conspiracy-minded alike concluding it was the KGB responsible for planting the bomb on the cruise ship. Of course some even more conspiratorial minded individuals blame Aliens, however the consensus seems to be that it was a successful KGB operation. Among those lost in the bombing was Charles Koch, brother of current President David Koch. The death of his brother was a contributing factor in David Koch's decision to retreat into isolation, and further the decision to launch the coup that overthrew the ineffective Hammons administration. Charles Koch of course is not the only well-known member of the family (Excluding David), with family patriarch Fred Chase Koch having quite the renown among the Liberal Media due to his vocal support for Nazi Germany, something which President Koch has made some attempts to distance himself from. Fred C. Koch's status as a founder of the John Birch Society has come as an ironic contrast to the avowed Social Liberalism of his two sons; despite the father-son duo's staunch agreement in matters of the Free Market. The Koch family may never be truly whole without the beloved father, son, and brother that was Charles Koch, but we can still commit ourselves to keeping his memory alive, and aim to hold the Communist butchers who killed so many great men and women accountable for their brazen murder on that ill-fated Atlantic Cruise."

 heartlands_flavour.18.d:0 "The Natural Law Party of the Heartlands has been a curious and unusual partner for the Paleo-conservative movement. Originally founded in Fairfield, Iowa, it was closely tied to the Maharishi University of Management, an institution built around a “consciousness-based education” system of Transcendental Meditation. The party was founded by John Hagelin to promote governing in harmony with “natural law.” Its founders believed that many societal problems could be solved through combining policies such as preventive health care, sustainable agriculture, and renewable energy with ideas rooted in Transcendental Meditation. Most famously, the party proposed a government-subsidized group of 7,000 advanced meditators, known as Yogic Flyers, who could reduce crime, lower unemployment, raise gross national product, improve public health, and render the nation effectively invulnerable to foreign threats.Politically homeless in its early years, the Natural Law Party attempted to elect Hagelin wherever ballot access could be achieved. Its strongest footholds emerged in Illinois, the Heartlands, and the Great Lakes aided in part by celebrity supporters such as Mike Love of the Beach Boys and the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. In 2000, the party finally found a lasting home by forming a coalition with the Paleocons in the Heartlands, despite Pat Buchanan’s reservations. Concentrating its resources there it has grown modestly over the following years. Today, as a junior partner it holds a number of local offices and settled into its role of pushing its consciousness-based ideas ideology in small communities and communes. Small scale Yogi flyer programs, Vedic science centres, astrology guided policy, and attempts to tap into the unified field of human intelligence have all been reported in these communities."

From bogus claims of a private Mailroom in the basement of the Heartlander White House to allegations of her purchasing Iraqi uranium, to some alleging Rodham is secretly the operator of a major chain of Pizza Restaurants, or others simply accusing Rodham of being a lizard-like alien, conspiracies surrounding President Rodham are perhaps more common than corn within the Heartlands. Unfortunately, not all conspiracies surrounding Rodham are so benign. Some have accused Rodham of culpability in the death of longtime friend Vince Foster. Mr. Foster, who worked with Rodham in her legal practice in Arkansas before her move to the Heartlands, tragically committed suicide in 1993. Rumours surrounding Foster's death have persisted ever since, in part due to his closeness to President Rodham. The most depraved of the Liberal fringe have been quick to jump on Foster's suicide as a way to attack Rodham, accusing her of being involved in Foster's death. Some have even gone so far as to accuse Hillary Rodham of having pulled the trigger herself. These claims are demonstrably false, and are just yet more proof of the insanity of the Liberal Media. They should be ashamed of themselves for pushing such outrageous lies. As it stands most have absolutley refused to give this story any air, but among those deadset in their hatred of President Rodham, she is indisputably behind the killing of Foster, refusing any and all evidence that it was a simple suicide. Conspiracists have also targeted other individuals related to the Rodham campaign who have died under mysterious circumstances, including figures such as Don Henry and Ron Brown back in Arkansas, and much more recently, Omaha resident and DNC consultant Seth Rich."

 heartlands_flavour.20.d:0 "William Jefferson Clinton's status as the Heartland's first Divorced President has been mentioned sparsely ever since he assumed the Presidency. His main opponent would have probably mentioned his messy divorce with Hillary Rodham in the late 90's... had Hillary Rodham not also been his opponent in the General Election. The fact that Clinton was running against his ex-wife was quite the funny coincidence to many, with no shortage of jokes cracked about it throughout the course of the campaign. While Rodham was never one to bring up old blood, or mention the fact that Clinton's infidelity (combined with political differences) ended their marriage, campaign surrogates were happy to do so on her behalf. While Clinton has never been formally remarried, the President has had the reputation as the Heartland's most eligible bachelor, with countless flings both defining the laid-back nature of his Presidency and providing a steady stream of work for the President's PR department. Champagne, Hot Tubs, and 'Hired Company' have defined Clinton's personal life within the Heartlander White House, something which his opponents are well aware of. The seedier nature of Clinton's personal life has severely damaged his reputation, and despite appearing often with longtime partner Monica Lewinsky, Clinton seems to be in no rush to get re-married, especially considering how his first marriage ended. Allegations of human trafficking have also unfortunately plagued Clinton's administration. Of course, Clinton is not the only major figure within the Heartland Democratic Party to have engaged in extramarital escapades, with prominent Cabinet Official Gary Hartpence also being known for cheating on his wife with author Donna Rice, a scandal which prematurely ended his run for the White House back in 1984."

Economic recovery across the Heartlands has boosted disposable income, drawing renewed crowds to the more than 100 barbecue restaurants citywide. Attendance has also surged at the American Royal World Series of Barbecue, along with growing membership in the Kansas City Barbeque Society, the world’s largest competitive barbecue organization. Kansas City-style barbecue began in the Pendergast era with Henry Perry, who smoked meats from a trolley barn in the historic 18th & Vine district. Known for slow-smoked meats, dry rubs, and a thick, sweet sauce made from tomatoes, molasses, and brown sugar, the style features a wide range of meats with a side of burnt ends, crispy cubes of smoked meat. Perry’s legacy later became Arthur Bryant’s, still operating today and famously visited by President Ronald Reagan, even if this acomplishment has not aged well to many, unlike several of the festival's smoked and dry-aged meats. Despite the City's division in the wake of the Great Collapse, Kansas City remains the heart of competitive barbecue through the barbecue society, which sanctions more than 100 competitions annually and boasts over 10,000 members. This year’s events reached new heights with the appearance of Ohio native and flavor maestro Guy Fieri."

This weather pattern has caused prolonged, intense rainfall and catastrophic flooding along Colorado’s Front Range, from Colorado Springs to Fort Collins. The flooding has caused at least eight deaths and additional people missing or unaccounted for. Emergency response efforts have rescued at least 1750 people and 300 pets, though operations have been hampered. Damage to infrastructure and the environment has been extensive. Nearly 19000 homes have been damaged and more than 1500 destroyed. Floodwaters have affected the energy sector, shutting down hundreds of oil and gas wells and causing spills from damaged storage tanks, raising concerns about water contamination especially after waste water from flooded fracking wells introducing lead into the local water. Having experienced varying levels of drought prior to the week of storms, ‘biblical’ flooding has been a real turnaround for the state's fortune. Already Federal Disaster agencies are on the scene to aid in recovery efforts, however the Heartland's disaster relief agencies, still reeling from under-funding and unclear direction after the Anarchy of the early 2010s have their work cut out for them.

As the successor states consolidated the Heartlands, Utah and Texas formed the American Organization of Helium Exporters in order to coordinate a consistent price and maintain their position as the world’s largest supplier as they rebuilt. Today, the AOHE remains a key provider to the “free world” alongside Canada, competing with Qatar and Algeria. This position has grown the Colorado Springs Labor Day Lift Off, which began in 1976 as a small race between friends, into the popular Colorado Springs Balloon Classic, featuring nearly 100 balloons from AOHE nations. Funded by the organisation, it has become a popular attraction with prospect lake as a beautiful backdrop.

With the Denver-Julesburg and Piceance Basins, along with other prospects, oil and gas production far exceeds national needs. Further with local refinement facilities, Colorado has become a critical hub for transporting and distributing energy, connecting abundant production in Texas and Alberta, to the wider continent. Refining is concentrated in Denver, McPherson, and Coffeyville, covering both regional fuel self-sufficiency and high-complexity processing of heavy crude. At the heart of this network is the Keystone Pipeline, carrying crude from Canada and the Great Lakes onto Illinois and Texas. This is then supported by Regional pipelines like CHS’s Jayhawk and Kaw networks, Tallgrass Interstate Gas Transmission, and Trailblazer link production fields that carry it interstate. In a recent controversy, stakeholder efforts to build on the Keystone pipeline through Montana and tap the Bakken fields have ignited fierce opposition. Environmentalists, minority groups, and Native Americans have protested, with the idea of dealing with the 'North-West imperative' White Supremacists completely unconscionable. Exiled native Americans from North Dakota, in particular, warn of the devastating impact on their reservations and the fact the pipeline would encroach onto their stolen land.

Here in the Heartlands, two gifted songwriters have taken the Heartlands by storm with a smash-hit musical, albeit one that has its share of critics. The highly-contreversial production blends contemporary politics, religion, and the struggle for the Once-United States into a medium that is simultaneously crass, vulgar, and incredibly elegant and moving. With lavish sets, musical scores, characters and messages, this new musical sensation is the brainchild of Colorado native Trey Parker and co-creator Matt Stone. This musical follows the daily lives of colourful residents in a fictional Colorado town as they navigate an off-screen war implied to be on Heartland soil. The name of the fictional town, as well as many of the characters, were borrowed from a previous work of Parker's, a Television show made with crudely-drawn paper cutouts, which lasted barely a season and has mostly been relegated to obscurity. This musical is a savage mockery of contemporary politics and those who wish to see the Heartlands take up the mantle of the old United States, utilizing a hardline Libertarian message to advocate for Heartlander separatism via catchy songs and dances. In keeping with the Musical's contrarian aesthetics, former President Hammons is featured as a character, a character with no lines who simply sits in the background and reacts to the absurd going-ons on stage. In keeping with the surrealistic aesthetic, residents of neighboring Utah have been portrayed as insane human-like creatures with unhinged jaws, with mockery of Mormonism being laid on heavy. Overall, this musical has had solid reviews, especially the songs, however the political message has been criticized by many, with many finding the musical to lack a coherent position, and instead mocking anybody portrayed as truly caring about the future of America, with the musical instead retreating into a position of detached nihilism."

Poor opinion polling combined with Buchanan's own advanced age have put three young and divisive conservative politicians in the saddle to secure Buchanan's legacy. The most overtly pro-Buchanan is Catholic traditionalist, anti-immigration activist, and paleoconservative Paul Gosar of Wyoming. Gosar has expressed the need for a more radically Christian alternative to more secular nationalist politicians, along with a "no-compromise" style of governance for the Isolationist Party, rejecting coalitions with the Republicans or the American Restorationists, largely defunct since their loss to Bill Clinton in 2011. The second major candidate is Isolationist house leader Tom Tancredo, known for decades of experience within the political world promoting paleoconservative beliefs. Tancredo, a fervent isolationist and anti-immigrant politician, seeks to bring the party back to its roots as a party opposed to the unification of America and emblematic of right-wing frontier spirits. The third candidate is Kris Kobach, who although radical in his own right, has never truly labeled himself as a paleoconservative. Focusing on immigration but also economic arguments for tax cuts, defense of the capitalist system, and anti-communism, Kobach is the most reasonable choice for those that would seek a coalition with Republicans. However Buchanan himself fervently denies rumours of attempts to replace him, and if he is able to outmaneuver those gunning for his seat, then he may just be able to remain as President of New America."
