Mainly seeking to replicate the same fascist positions of anti-liberalism and anti-communism and a third position, neo-fascists differ in rhetoric and organization from ‘historical fascists’. These neo-fascists focus mostly on anti-immigration and anti-communism, sometimes building alliances with liberal anti-communist forces, and even partaking in electoralism."

 rexist:0 "Rexism"
 rexist_desc:0 "Rexism calls for the moral renewal of society through dominance of the Catholic Church, the total authority of the state over all aspects of life and the abolition of liberal democracy.

 synarchist:0 "Synarchism"
 synarchist_desc:0 "Inspired by Pope Leo XIII’s 1891 encyclical Rerum Novarum, synarchism advocates class collaboration, extreme social conservatism and respect for hierarchical authority.

 russian_socialist:0 "Russian Socialism"
 russian_socialist_desc:0 "Describing an unconventional offshoot of Marxism-Leninism, 'Russian socialism', as its detractors call it, draws as much from Lev Gumilyov as it does from Karl Marx.

 national_populist:0 "National Populism"
 national_populist_desc:0 "National populists are on the edge of extreme ultranationalist politics, toeing the line between nationalism and fascism. Extolling authoritarian, militaristic, and anti-communist positions, and sometimes racialist politics, national populists may seek to work within a liberal framework or subvert it, which makes them an unquantifiable political force and their true adherence to fascism questionable."
 patriot_movement:0 "Patriot Movement"
 patriot_movement_desc:0 "A splinter of the comparatively moderate Militia Movement in post-collapse America, the Patriot Movement differs by having more ultranationalist and arguably fascistic tendencies.
