cuba.3.t:0 "Operation Mongoose Recommences"
cuba.3.d:0 "As the intervention in Yemen continues to drag the President’s approval ratings down, it is abundantly clear that a victory is needed to offset the quagmire in the middle east. As such. President Donald Rumsfeld has authorized the CIA to initiate the long-shelved Operation Mongoose. Having been rejected in 1962 by President Nixon, recent reports have now detailed that the conditions in Cuba and the Soviet Union are now ripe to dust off the operation once more, with reduced risk of backlash from the international community. Furthermore, these reports detail that their operative, referred to only as ‘El Cabro’, has managed to establish his movement and set up supply lines to the mainland in anticipation of the operation, and is now ready to strike against the Castro regime. With a victory in Cuba being able to go a long way to shore up the president's support, it is hoped that the complacency of the Cuban government will be enough to deal it quite a significant blow, and prove to the world that the America remains a player to be reckoned with. Although hopes are high that they will be able to swiftly and effectively bring down the Castro regime at long last, we must be sure to be prepared for whatever outcome may come from this."

cuba.4.t:0 "Ferry Hijacked in Havana Harbour"
cuba.4.d:0 "A mix of panic and confusion swept through the capital today after a ferry crossing the Havana harbor was hijacked. Having been covertly trailed by a small boat since their departure, Los Ochenta y Dos was boarded by armed combatants who quickly took control of the cabin and seized controls and communications before port authorities had realized what was going on. Only once the ferry was secure did the terrorists issue their demands, where they decreed that the passengers would be let go once they had been transferred ten million convertible Soviet rubles and granted safe passage to Lima in Peru. With this list of demands reaching President Raúl Castro, who swiftly rejected the notion of appeasing these terrorists, orders were given to liberate the ferry and resolve the crisis immediately. As the Revolutionary Armed Forces scramble to assemble a unit to liberate the ferry and ensure the safety of the passengers, the Revolutionary Navy has blockaded the harbor, ensuring that the terrorists will not be able to escape. Now, with this threat having emerged seemingly from thin air, the nation waits for a resolution to this terrifying crisis."

cuba.5.t:0 "Security Forces Liberate Hijacked Ferry"
cuba.5.d:0 "For three days the terrorists have been allowed to hold the harbor in a tight grip, but after these three agonizing days, our security forces have been able to liberate Los Ochenta y Dos. With the Revolutionary Navy seemingly allowing the ferry access to the open waters, its vessels vacating the area, our security forces were patiently inserting underwater with grappling devices, deploying a small detachment of twelve men to board the vessel unnoticed. Heading towards the main cabin, one terrorist noticed our security forces approaching, and was quick to warn his compatriots, before locking himself into the compartment. Fanning out across the vessel, aiming to capture the terrorists on the lower decks, four men remained above to breach the control room. Using breaching charges, the doors to the cabin were blown open, revealing three of the terrorists laying dead on the floor by self-inflicted gunshot wounds, presumably opting for death over capture. Discovering swiftly that the remaining twelve terrorists had also taken their own lives, and that there had been no civilian casualties, the security forces turned to aid those onboard and returned the ferry to port with more questions than answers."

cuba.6.t:0 "Bayamo PCC Headquarters Attacked by Armed Men"
cuba.6.d:0 "Barely a month after the hijacking of Los Ochenta y Dos has the nation once more been struck by the vile terrorists. As officials of the Communist Party in Bayamo arrived for work at the party headquarters, armed gunmen sprung from the shadows across the street, unleashing a torrent of hellfire while detonating makeshift explosive devices and gunning down anyone they could see, attempting to storm the building. Upon entry, a further seven comrades were gruesomely murdered before the police arrived and surrounded the premises, engaging in a firefight with a group of terrorists posted outside. With President Raúl Castro now informed of the attack, the General Intelligence Directorate has suggested that Bayamo has been attacked for symbolic value, as it was the landing site of the Granma Expedition in 1956. Upon the police breaching the building, being ordered to capture as many terrorists as possible, a similar conclusion to the Los Ochenta y Dos hijacking ensued as the terrorists, once they realized they had been cornered, yet again took their own lives. Twelve have died, with dozens more injured, and still without answers, the President sees himself forced to hold an emergency session of the Council of Ministers."

cuba.7.t:0 "Council of Ministers Debates Response"
cuba.7.d:0 "In the aftermath of the assault on the party headquarters in Bayamo, President Raúl Castro has  convened an emergency meeting of the Council of Ministers to debate the response to this unsettling wave of terrorism. With the prime suspect being the American Republic, the Atlanta government either being directly behind these attacks or merely supplying the terrorists with the means to wage war, the Minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces, Leopoldo Cintra Frías, has immediately suggested that the only meaningful response to these attacks is the complete encirclement of the occupied Guantanamo Bay Naval Base. Claiming that the base is a natural vantage point for smuggled arms and coordination between Atlanta and the attackers, Cintra Frías insists that the encirclement will both cut off the terrorists, and show our resolve to the Rumsfeld regime. However, with the General Intelligence Directory still unable to offer decisive evidence that the American Republic is directly involved, the encirclement may prove to be a needlessly provocative, and worse, ineffectual action in stemming the terrorist violence. Furthermore, the apparent zeal of the terrorists has indicated that they are no ordinary exile terrorist movement, akin to the bygone Alpha 66, prompting the President to suggest that the focus of any investigation should be in the eastern Sierra Maestras, which he knows all too well is a perfect hiding place for a rebel group. However, with scant evidence but a hunch underlying the President’s points, the Council of Ministers has put the decision to a vote, as the path ahead seems uncertain..."

cuba.8.d:0 "Despite the General Intelligence Directory’s skepticism that the American Republic is responsible for the recent terrorist attacks, the decision has now been made to surround Guantanamo Bay Naval Base to prevent the Yanqui forces from sneaking across the line of control. With our military forces mobilized across the east, beginning the encirclement of the imperialist base, the American Republic has now expectedly responded to our movements, with President [USA.GetLeader] declaring our actions to be an affront to peace in the region. Going further, the Americans have stated that if our forces are removed from the frontier by the end of the day, they will have no choice but to reinforce Guantanamo Bay Naval Base with a naval task force and further ground forces to ‘protect American military assets’. Despite the severity of these threats, the deadline passed with no action from Atlanta, allowing our military to maintain their positions and stand up to the American government. With no sightings of any further American action, the first day of the blockade has been described as a success, as American forces in the base seem to stay put and merely continue their routines."

cuba.9.d:0 "Though the moves into the Sierra Maestras were believed to be a grasp by many, with the American Republic’s opening into our country remaining wide open, the General Intelligence Directory has now been able to dispel any doubts, as an abandoned cottage a few miles outside Bayamo shows signs of recent activity. Scouring the building in hopes of identifying its former occupants, the DGI tore through various boxes that had been left behind. With most of these boxes being full of unused ammunition, mostly of calibers only notable for being used by the Yanquis, the continued search in the kitchen revealed that the cottage had been used to organize the recent attacks on Bayamo. With maps scattered across various desks, all detailing positions for the commencement of the attacks and which entry points could ensure a maximum number of casualties, the DGI progressed further, eventually finding documents that had been christened with a symbol of a goat. With the evidence now secured, these findings have only created more questions for the Council of Ministers with barely any answers in sight."

cuba.10.t:0 "General Intelligence Directory Warns of Further Terrorist Attacks"
cuba.10.d:0 "Having remained on constant alert since the hijacking of Los Ochenta y Dos, the General Intelligence Directory has today warned that the recent assault on the Bayamo PCC headquarters was not the end of the terrorist movement and that more attacks can be anticipated within the coming days or weeks. Analyzing the patterns and tactics of the latest wave of attacks, the DGI has deemed that the assaults on the Cuban people have not been the actions of a scattered or disorganized movement. Rather, it is believed that whoever is responsible for the attacks is well coordinated, well-funded, and capable of organizing attacks nationwide. Although not having any concrete leads as to who is leading the organization, or how it is structured, the DGI does have a handful of suspects it can pursue in the anticipation and hopefully prevention of further strikes. Presenting the Council of Ministers its recommendations on how to maintain public safety, the DGI has now begun to follow up on several sightings of masked men across the forests of Cuba, stating that further resources will be needed to ensure the safety and security of the Cuban people and revolution."

cuba.11.t:0 "Concerns of Terror Spread Through Society"
cuba.11.d:0 "Though we have successfully defended the people of Cuba from the recent threats to the revolution, the DGI has now reported that these efforts do not appear to be as appreciated as President Raúl Castro had believed, as concerns over public security appear to sky-rocket across the country. Although recent affairs have, obviously, not gone unnoticed by our people, the deluge of letters received by Communist Party sections across the country all relating to the recent wave of attacks has taken multiple party secretaries by surprise. Having read through over a dozen letters from all corners of the nation, the President has now shared one letter from an eight-year-old girl in Santa Clara, who claims to be too scared to go to school, fearing that the bad men will come to blow her up as perhaps the most poignant sign of the extent of public unrest. Sharing this letter with his close advisors, the President has now demanded that the DGI redouble their efforts to find and uproot the terrorist menace. With no remedy in sight to alleviate public concerns, President Raúl claims to be doing everything he can to respond as strongly to the attacks as possible. However, it is clear that the populace simply does not yet consider these efforts enough, and that more concrete results need to be presented."

cuba.12.t:0 "Reflections on the Recent Attacks by Comrade Fidel"
cuba.12.d:0 "With concerns about terror attacks spreading like a wildfire among the frightened public, former President Fidel Castro has now published his stance in his regularly scheduled editorial piece in the Granma newspaper. The essay, simply titled ‘Reflections on the Recent Attacks’, gave a scathing critique on the continued existence of American capitalism, stating that since 1987, it has been nothing more but a dying pariah state, now terrorizing Cuban civilians out of sheer spite. Calling upon everyone to stand together in the face of these attacks, Comrade Fidel promised the nation that the Cuban government is doing everything it can to end the crisis. What is currently needed of them is to remain calm, take care of one another, and help each other whenever needed. Stating that the terrorists seek to undermine the unity and mutual trust of Cuban society, the former President is firm that they must not be allowed to do so, as it was only through these key elements that he and his eighty-two men persevered in the early days of the revolution. Although a small gesture, all things considered, Fidel Castro is widely respected and trusted, making his words very reassuring for the people in times of crisis."

cuba.13.t:0 "San Julian Air Base Attacked by Mortars"
cuba.13.d:0 "As the General Intelligence Directorate warned us, the terrorists have struck again, with the San Julian Air Base in Pinar del Rio now their most recent target. As dawn broke, the base was suddenly struck, explosions erupting across the runway. Quickly realizing they were under attack, base personnel switfly raised the alarm. As base security scrambled to locate the attackers, command signaled for support from local army detachments, as shells began to tear through the hangars. When reinforcements finally arrived, the terrorists had already fled the scene, leaving six dead and dozens more injured, and three planes destroyed, mercifully low levels of damage and casualties, despite the sudden and horrific nature of the attack. This display of firepower has worried many within the DGI and military, who had previously been operating under the assumption that the terrorist movement did not have access to such heavy ordinance, and more pertinently, that it was contained within the eastern half of the country. With the culprits on the run, and security having failed to anticipate the reach of the organization, the military has suggested that the province be placed under temporary lockdown to ensure that a chance might finally be had to capture and interrogate the culprits. Though perhaps a necessary endeavor, such decree would no doubt cause unrest, leaving the President unsure as to how best to proceed."

cuba.14.t:0 "Armed Militants Captured in Guane"
cuba.14.d:0 "With martial law declared in Pinar del Rio, both the citizens in the region and the President have been anxiously waiting for updates from the National Revolutionary Police and the Revolutionary Armed Forces as they continue to track down the assailants involved in the San Julian attack. To their relief, they did not need to wait long, as confirmation has been received that the culprits have been captured. Following the trail to the village of Guane, military units arrived in time as the culprits were preparing to leave the town, having stayed overnight in a local Casa Particular homestay. Surprising them in an encircling movement, the terrorists were quickly apprehended, fortunately before any of them could take their lives. As investigators conducted an immediate search of the vehicle belonging to the men, the military found the mortars used in the San Julian attack, as well as numerous small arms, confirming their prisoners' identities, the DGI’s quickly sending them off to a local supermax facility pending interrogation. As word begins to spread about this successful capture in front pages across the country, the people's confidence in the government has been strengthened, as the chances to learn the identities of these terrorists are significantly increased."
cuba.14.o1:0 "Excellent job, comrades!"
cuba.15.t:0 "Calm Returns to the West"
cuba.15.d:0 "Though the attack on San Julian Air Base shook the country, and has caused much worry that similar attacks on military facilities would follow, it would seem that the opposite is the case. As the army and DGI remain on high alert and have strengthened the patrols in Pinar del Rio, it would seem that the terrorists have refrained from launching further attacks. As caution slowly slinks back into the shadows, everyday life is beginning to return to the towns and villages of the region. Though this peace is uneasy, with heightened patrols likely to remain until the end of the year, the lack of any action by the terrorists has been of significant relief to President Castro, though the ongoing lack of intel on the terrorist movement remains a pressing concern among intelligence operatives and military planners alike. At least, having managed to avoid inciting fear in the populace through the imposition of a lockdown, the President’s approach has seen an uptick in support for the government and has helped silence many skeptics in the halls of power. Urging the region to not celebrate until the terrorists have been caught, the return of peace, if only perhaps briefly, demonstrates that the Communist Party will forever protect its people from harm."

cuba.16.t:0 "Jose Ramon Machado Ventura Calls for Greater Anti-Terror Measures"
cuba.16.d:0 "It is no secret that the recent increase in terrorism has been a great cause of worry amongst the civilian population, and now Vice President Jose Ramon Machado Ventura has seemingly taken on the role as their self-appointed spokesperson in the Council of Ministers. Though loyal to the President, Ventura has, like many, fears a return to the uncertainty of the 1960s, where American intervention unleashed a brief but terrible torrent of counter-revolutionary violence. Demanding stronger steps to be taken to curb the recent wave of terrorism, he has now called on President Raúl Castro to strengthen the powers of the DGI, urging the government to organize closer cooperation between the directorate, the Committees for the Defence of the Revolution, and the Revolutionary Armed Forces, all to ensure a swifter and more effective response to the crisis. Stopping short of calling for the imposition of nationwide martial law, these demands, if implemented, would be tantamount to a true recognition of the crisis that risks tarnishing the government’s credibility at a crucial time, being an admission it does not have the situation under control. However, for the sake of the country, Raúl has agreed to consider his proposals, tempering Ventura’s frustration before it creates further division."

cuba.17.t:0 "President Raul Castro Meets with Military Leadership"
cuba.17.d:0 "Having agreed to at least consider Vice President Jose Ramon Machado Ventura’s requests, President Raúl Castro nevertheless remains skeptical of their effectiveness, worried that they will merely destabilize an already reeling country. Nevertheless, agreeing that something has to be done, the President has now elected to meet with the leadership of the Revolutionary Armed Forces to discuss army intelligence and to evaluate the efforts against the recent wave of terrorism. Concurring that these attacks are coming from an organized, though as-of-yet unknown source, the FAR has suggested that intelligence be diverted away from prevention towards proaction. Believing that the nation cannot sit idly by and wait for the next attack to occur, Leopoldo Cintra Frías has convinced the President that the best way to tackle this menace is to track down the command structure of this organization rather than dealing with it cell by cell. Despite fearing this diversion of resources will lead to higher casualties, the military has assured the President that protection of civilians remains their top priority and that the proposed approach will not detract from that noble goal."

cuba.18.d:0 "The people of Camagüay woke up to sounds of gunfire and police sirens today, as a group of armed terrorists have in a terrifying turn of events breached the Provincial Hospital through the parking lot and taken an entire wing hostage. Though the Revolutionary Army arrived quickly, aiding local police forces in evacuating as many patients and staff members as possible, there still are hundreds of innocent civilians trapped inside awaiting rescue. The terrorists have now issued a list of demands to our government, stating that ‘all PCC members and both Castros must be immediately tried for high treason, and allow for a transitional government that would outlaw abortion, homosexuality, and all other communist perversions’, stating that should those demands not be met within twenty-four hours, the gunmen will start executing hostages at random. This hostage crisis has fostered significant and fiery debate within the Council of Ministers as a solution must be found posthaste. With units of the Revolutionary Army already surrounding the hospital, giving the order to liberate it would let us swiftly and effectively liberate it, but the General Intelligence Directorate has warned that the terrorists would certainly be able to notice should the military prepare for an assault, instead arguing that it is instead better to call upon the elite Military Unit 4895, nicknamed ‘the Black Wasps’, for a surgical strike when the terrorists have been worn down. As the clock keeps counting down, the Council needs to reach a decision shortly."

cuba.19.d:0 "In a horrific turn of events, the decision to send in the Revolutionary Armed Forces to liberate the Provincial Hospital of Camagüay has resulted in abject catastrophe. Though the hospital, as intended, was liberated within twenty-four hours, this success has come at a tremendous cost. As the assault began, the terrorists, seemingly scared of our response, began to massacre as many hostages as possible. At the same time, the Revolutionary Army conscripts were hesitant about the risks of accidentally harming the hostages, which delayed the initiation of the operation, leading to not only to mass casualties among the civilians taken hostage within the hospital but also to casualties among the soldiers themselves amidst all the chaos. Alongside this, none of the terrorists will be able to stand trial for their heinous crime, as Revolutionary Army units were not fortunate enough to capture even one of the terrorists alive. While the government has yet to issue comments beyond perfunctory condolences to the families of the victims, common Cubans are terrified, as concerns about ‘all-powerful terrorists’ and government inefficacy prove themselves to be, at least partially, true."

cuba.20.d:0 "After hours of anxious wait, Military Unit 4895 has now finally reported back of the conclusion of their operation at the Provincial Hospital of Camagüay. Repelling onto the roof under the cover of night from a helicopter, Military Unit 4895 were able to quickly get in and catch the terrorists by surprise as army units outside played loud music from a set of massive loudspeakers. Moving swiftly and gunning down anyone bold enough to go defend the roof, the Black Wasps were able to successfully neutralize the terrorists despite ferocious resistance. With the collateral damage being minimal, the civilians trapped inside were freed and given first aid, provided by the regular army who helped secure the building. Aside from that, numerous terrorists were successfully captured and are now being escorted to Havana for interrogation, further proving the efficiency of the Black Wasps. Though Raúl Castro will certainly receive plenty of praise for his decisive action in dealing with the terrorist scum, the sheer brutality and scale of this attack is hard to ignore, with fear lingering across much of the nation, as the terrorists yet again seem to confound the country’s security services."

cuba.21.d:0 "In an effort to showcase the unity of the people and their enduring commitment to the revolution, the party has now organized a mass demonstration in Havana to denounce the vile atrocities committed by the terrorists and showcase the unshakable will of the Cuban people. Having invited the seamen of the Revolutionary Navy from the hijacking of Los Ochenta y Dos, alongside several of the hostages from the ferry, the party has hoped that their resolute words will be enough to send the message that the nation is united and that the terrorists are doing nothing but strengthening its resolve. Even the international community has pledged its support for the government as Assata Shakur, the legitimate American ambassador to Cuba, likewise participated, denouncing the terrorists and praising the Cuban people for their indomitable spirit. With her arrival, the demonstration's attention also turned towards her subsequent denunciation of the American Republic and its tyrannical ruler, [USA.GetLeader], who has continued the imperialist policy that defined the former United States. With further public manifestations planned in cities across the country, the party hopes that this celebration will grant them time to find concrete answers about the whats and wheres of the terrorist movement plaguing the country."

cuba.22.d:0 "Though the public manifestation in Havana proved to be a significant success in rallying the people around the party, the manifestations outside of the capital have been reportedly wrought with issues, as many Communist Party organizers have reportedly not been as effective at vetting their speakers as was hoped. On numerous occasions, speakers in Santiago de Cuba, Santa Clara, and a number of other cities have been seemingly calling for a different Cuba, speaking on behalf of the liberal opposition. With calls for democratization being heard at manifestations across the country, it has been confirmed by the DGI that these speakers have been sent purposefully by figures such as Oswaldo Payá, Antonio Guedes, or José Daniel Ferrer, all prominent leaders of reactionary anti-communist movements, to subvert the revolutionary spirit of the Cuban people. Although these speakers were subtle, always claiming to be acting in accordance with the party and our revolutionary democracy, the obvious attempt was noticed by security or organizers present who did not always have much success in removing these speakers from the stage. While the people seem firmly rallied against the terrorists, it would seem that other groups have managed to use our lessened attention for their own, counterrevolutionary aims."

Though such measures have already been considered by the President, the growing liberal threat making the matter seem ever more pressing, Raúl Castro remains dismissive towards these pleas, stating that the party must always appear to be in control of the situation, and a declaration of martial law would signal anything but. However, the president’s stance is not shared by all, with the hardliners disagreeing with his presumption, stating that the imposition of martial law is precisely the sign of resolute strength by the government that the Cuban people need. With the Vice President having actually confronted the President on this matter, it is patently clear that the question cannot be delayed much further, as pressure continues to build among both the party and the public. The president can only hope that the ongoing investigation by the General Intelligence Directorate will pay off swiftly, putting an end to this crisis."

Shortly after the opening salvo of a carefully timed series of bomb attacks, Baracoa, Varadero, and Las Tunas police reported a series of hit-and-run attacks across their cities, as terrorists riding cars brandished weapons and attacked random passer-bys, before ending their chaotic spree of violence by crashing into random buildings, detonating explosives as they did so. Although the situation has now largely quieted down after a terrible day, police across the nation are still reporting that explosions are continuing well into the night, security forces of all stripes prowling the streets for suspects while the people huddle in their homes. Vice President Jose Ramon Machado Ventura was reportedly furious that such a brazen attack was launched upon the Cuban people, demanding all but full mobilization to stem this crisis. Whether or not the President has agreed with this call is unknown, as President Raúl Castro has instead spent most of the day coordinating emergency services and relief efforts to affected civilians, his work continuing well into the night as reports of deaths and injuries continue to arrive by the dozen, the final tally seeming to be over 300 people large.

Spearheaded by the Vice President, the proposal supposedly is backed up by party sections across the country, particularly in the cities especially affected by the attacks. Reading through various letters from party members across the nation, all of which support an end to the terror by any means necessary, the National Assembly has now insisted that the President finally impose what should have been enacted weeks ago and give the people the security they are crying out for. Though shaken by the violence witnessed recently, President Raúl Castro remains hesitant to enforce such radical measures continuing to claim that his imposition of martial law would undermine the credibility of the government by signaling to the terrorists that they are winning. Speaking privately with his Vice President, Raúl has been assured that his assent would not be a sign of weakness if it leads to the successful neutralization of their movement. However, even with these assurances, the President remains torn on what he should do, asking himself whether the action would signal more instability than what he might want."

Met with a shocking degree of applause from the National Assembly, the Vice President continued to question why Raúl Castro has refused to declare martial law, although urging the president to please elaborate his rationale as the nation continues to reel from the terrorist menace. Going further, Ventura continued that neither he nor ‘Raúl’s many, many comrades in the Communist Party’ struggle to comprehend why the president has remained passive in the light of the crisis, stating that continued inaction will lead to thousands more deaths. Despite the Vice President’s boiling blood, Ventura ended his speech to thunderous applause by declaring that he, and evidently the party, still supported Castro in his ongoing fight against the terrorist threat and urged the president to take action before it was too late. Though acknowledging his vice president’s wishes, Castro has merely issued a pointed reminder of the necessity of democratic centralism, a caustic response to his increasingly restless vice president and the growing party faction surrounding him."

Eager to help in any way he could, the ex-President first urged his brother to maintain the unity of the people, stating that the public manifestations were an important step in showcasing that the will of the people had not yet been broken. Second, Fidel argued that the nation must be prepared for the inevitability of further escalation from the American Republic, remarking that despite their continued denial of involvement, this is obviously paid for by American dollars, as a way to undermine the revolution and continue the imperialist policies that have characterized their relations for decades. Stating Raúl of course had a fine grasp on the situation, the ex-President ended his impromptu lecture by stating that his brother would always have his support, both politically and personally. Embracing one another, the Castros poured out a drink and toasted to the lives lost in defense of the revolution."

Despite the supposed thousands of letters in support of martial law that Vice President Jose Ramon Machado Ventura proudly boasted of during the debates, it appears as though the decision has failed to capture universal public support, as the military deployments have also been met with concern by many, worried that it would do nothing more but paint very public targets in the city streets of the country. Seeing it as a natural reaction to the situation, with it being clear that the younger generations are more disconcerted by the President’s decision than their elders, the armed forces have done their best to make the transition into martial law as smooth as possible. Despite these concerns, most citizens reportedly feel safer now that the Revolutionary Armed Forces are protecting the streets, assured that the government seems to be taking their safety and security seriously in the face of the continued attacks, though the lingering question remains of why it took so long time as it did."

Decrying martial law as nothing more than an excuse to silence the ‘legal, peaceful, and patriotic’ opposition to communist rule, liberal groups across the country have now urged the people to turn out in opposition towards the highly necessary measure. The largest of such protests was in Havana, where the liberals made their opposition to the terrorist threat clear despite the public ban on assemblies larger than ten people, accusing the government of fighting fire with fire. Gathering outside of the Capitolio with a crowd of over seven hundred people according to police estimates, the situation risked spiraling out of control before the National Revolutionary Police were able to arrive in force. After giving strict instructions to disperse and attaining scant results, the police fired tear gas into the crowd, scattering scores of protesters, with many swiftly vacating the scene, before the stragglers were handled by riot police and water cannons. However, such harsh action may have underlined their point, as some across the country have seemingly begun to sympathize with these liberals, claiming that the crackdown on civil liberties is excessive."

With the celebrations going ahead undeterred, they are sure to rally the Cuban people in defiance of the terrorist threat and in support of the party’s policies. Personally considering the Day of National Rebellion as a much-needed escape for many as the scars of terror, Raúl Castro has ordered security services to be on highest alert to ensure that no disturbances will rear their head. Passing by his older brother’s house before traveling to the airport, Raúl and Fidel exchanged words about Fidel’s upcoming essay upon the significance of the 26th of July, as well as Raúl’s own considerations for his speech. Fidel, always the more charismatic of the two, helped Raúl with a couple of pointers for the speech, before the two brothers bid their farewells, and Raúl went off to fly to the Oriente. As party officials are putting up decorations and preparing for the celebrations, the President is now on his way to Santiago de Cuba, reportedly in high spirits, ready to celebrate the fifty-seventh anniversary of the 26th of July Movement with a populace who until now have been all too starved of festivities."

After contact failed to be re-established, army units reacted swiftly in the hopes of finding the presidential plane, but they found only the wreckage scattered across Cayo Coco. Any hopes of rescuing survivors were quickly dashed as it turned out that the fuselage had been destroyed by an explosive device, with total fatalities among the crew and passengers, hereunder President Castro himself. Forensic technicians were horrified to discover that the explosion had come from the inside of the aircraft, meaning that the terrorists somehow had gotten access to the president’s plane. While investigations are ongoing, the nation is reeling at the shock that not even the president was safe on the most sacred national holiday, no less. Celebrations of the 26th of July have been canceled all across the country, with the nation pouring out both its anger and its grief in the streets instead over the loss, joined by leading politicians. This crime against the Cuban people cannot be allowed to stand."

Under maximum possible security, with the legislature protected by a massive cordon of both elements of the National Revolutionary Police and the Revolutionary Armed Forces, President of the Assembly Ricardo Alarcón opened the debate. It would not take long. Recognizing the gravity of the situation, no other candidate for the presidency was presented but Fidel Castro himself. Although he had retired back in 2006 due to deteriorating health, Fidel’s near-universal popularity was deemed necessary for unifying the nation for the duration of this crisis. After a quick vote, the former president was unanimously reaffirmed for the office, an investiture he somberly accepted. Affected by the developments, the president kept his speech uncharacteristically short as he struggled to keep his composure, merely thanking them for their trust and promising to do his utmost to bring an end to the grievous attack upon the Cuban nation. Fidel’s return to power has, unsurprisingly, been received positively by the populace, who have, despite terrorist fears, held numerous rallies in favor of their returned leader."

Pledging to rip the terrorist groups plaguing the country up by root and stem, Fidel also accused the American Republic of sponsoring every attack that had taken place over the last year, stating that they would never let the Cuban Revolution live as long as they exist, promising a special vengeance for the decades of naked aggressions. Straining his voice hoarse at times, Fidel finished off by reiterating his inaugural pledge that he would not rest before he’d exacted justice for the litany of crimes committed against the Cuban nation. The speech has electrified the nation, with his call for vengeance being echoed across the nation by politicians and civilians, and local sections of the party are all reporting that support for the President is higher than ever.

However, although the crowd cheered at the president’s speech and the ongoing triumph of socialism, it was evident to all present that the President had not just arrived to speak on the successes of the past. Turning his attention to the present, Castro declared that retribution was imminent and that the terrorist menace would soon be decisively defeated, promising that the Cuban military was hard at work coordinating with the DGI in hunting down the remnants of their movement. Ending his speech by thanking the nation for standing with the revolutionary leadership during these trying times, the President left the stage to thunderous applause, the crowd eagerly awaiting the festivities across the city and anticipating the forthcoming announcement of the final victory."

Following intense interrogation of the two terrorists captured in the Oriente, and from tracking the use of vehicles within the towns and villages where the two million dollars were discovered, the DGI has now pinpointed the locations suspected of holding the bulk of the Army of the Lord’s hideouts. Ironically, the location of these encampments has been reported to be within the vicinity of where the 26th of July Movement organized fifty-seven years ago. Gathering high command and the lead investigators from the DGI, President Castro has initiated planning for an immediate assault on the encampments, dubbed Operation Heaven’s Fall, seeing a swift victory as the only chance to end the terrorist threat here and now, before they have a chance to scatter and regroup. Though some have urged a careful approach, believing that the Army of the Lord will have had time to fortify their position due to their uncontested hold over the mountains at least since the start of the year, but quite possibly before, the President has insisted that swift retribution is the only recourse, and that whatever fortifications they may have will not be able to stand against the overwhelming firepower of the Revolutionary Armed Forces."

Ordering the first wave of air strikes to begin just after eight in the morning, squadrons of MIG-29s rained down fire upon the various encampments of the unsuspecting Army of the Lord, obliterating scores of their numbers and throwing their militants into disarray. Swiftly after, helicopters followed in behind to drop off elite strike teams of the Revolutionary Armed Forces, to neutralize the survivors of the airstrikes and secure the locations. At the same time, the Revolutionary Armed Forces had surrounded the encampments, encircling the terrorists and preventing any from escaping the fist of the Revolutionary Armed Forces. By 8:47 AM, reports had confirmed that the encampments and their environs had been secured, at the cost of eighty-seven brave soldiers injured and thirteen reported dead. Despite the encampments being secure, there are no indications that El Cabro was present at any of them, meaning he and a select few followers were most likely able to escape. As the manhunt continues, the President has declared Operation Heaven’s Fall to be a complete success, with evaluations on the continued threat level of the Army of the Lord soon to follow."

Proudly trumpetting this fact to the nation as proof of the government’s skillful handling of the crisis, the President has decreed that martial law can now be lifted in every province. Though military readiness has yet to be relaxed, with soldiers still present in the streets, their duties as well as those of the police have been relaxed, demonstrating that the crisis has nearly abated. In response to the end of martial law, letters have flown in from across the nation to party headquarters, most prominently one from the now-famous little girl from Santa Clara, writing to thank him for ‘making the bad men stop’, saying that she is now able to visit her friends at school again. Widely publicized in the Granma newspaper, this letter perhaps more than anything speaks for the public sentiment, as relief is apparent all across the country. Away from public eyes, the party has also offered their congratulations to the President for his handling of the crisis, with Raúl Castro being received with standing applause at the most recent meeting of the Council of Ministers, with even Jose Ramon Machado Ventura praising the president for his deft resolution of the crisis. For his part, the president has promised that he will not rest until the last terrorist has been killed or apprehended, all while lapping up the praise of his comrades and countrymen."

Though the Council is largely in agreement over the successes of the anti-terror campaign, the escape of El Cabro remains a significant failing, with some arguing that he could have been caught had martial law only been more extensive, a claim the Vice President agreed with in part. Another major concern, believed by some to have been overlooked, the Council discussed the renewed assault of the Liberal dissident movement, which was seemingly able to use the party’s focus upon the terrorist threat to strengthen itself. As the brunt of the Army of the Lord is now defeated, the party unanimously agreed that the time had come to finally deal with the counterrevolutionary elements. Although there is much to be done, the destruction of the Army of the Lord has won much praise for both the military and ‘Army General’ Raúl Castro. With that, we can finally say that we have closed a sordid chapter in the book of Cuba’s history, and our president deserves much credit for his work in making it so."

Through the careful analysis of terrorist activity and movement across the nation, the DGI has now been able to capture two individuals involved in a movement referred to as the ‘Army of the Lord’ attempting to sneak into Santiago de Cuba, carrying a satchel full of explosives. These terrorists have, despite the hard work of the agents of the DGI, refused to reveal any meaningful information other than their organization's name and, more importantly, the name of a seemingly important figure known only as ‘El Cabro’. During interrogation these two men have spoken about El Cabro with both great respect and reverence, causing the DGI to present two possibilities, that El Cabro is either a general within the movement, or a spiritual leader. The revelation has also been coupled with the discovery of numerous unmarked dollars, with just under two million discovered in a nearby buried stash, and several documents listing contacts within the CIA. With this discovery, there can now be no doubt that the American Republic is involved in the attempts to destroy the revolution, as we had always suspected."

This assumption doesn’t seem to have held up, however, as the threat has seemingly diminished, with few if any reports of violence or suspicious activities nationwide. This sentiment of calm seems to have caught on across the country, with normality returning to our towns and cities. Though some are still afraid that the terrorists could return at any moment, the majority of the population is hopeful that the worst days are now behind them and that their daily lives may shortly resume as they used to be before the crisis. Despite the nationwide feelings of relief, the DGI has refused to relent in their vigilance, pledging to continue their anti-terrorist efforts until the last cell has been uprooted. Though low-level activity has been noticed, it has generally been classified as insignificant, posing little threat to public security. Nevertheless, the President has insisted that any terrorist activity be thwarted before they have the chance to use this lull to further their war on the people. With the DGI firmly and loyally following the president’s orders, the silence comes off as more eerie than anything else, with the Council of Ministers agreeing that the peace feels deliberate, considering the affairs of the last couple of months."

In his proposal, the President has stated that the socialist state must be modernized, remarking that the new century has given Cuba new struggles that cannot be tackled by the institutions of the past. Seeking to bring the Republic up to par with the fraternal republics of Europe, President Castro has called for a new era of transparency, pledging that constitutional reform shall usher in renewed liberty and prosperity for all. Specifically, Castro has placed a target on the gerontocracy that has taken hold over the party, claiming that the time might be upon the country to hand over power to the generation born after 1959, proposing an age limit of seventy-five years for the highest offices in the land. Though eyebrows have been raised over this due to the president’s age of seventy-nine years, it is widely expected that President Castro himself shall be exempted from this limit due to being 74 years old upon his initial assumption of office. Nevertheless, the Party has enthusiastically thrown its weight behind the calls for reform, seeing it as a sure-fire way to keep the people on its side and renew its hold over power."

Once the document has been approved, a public consultation period shall begin, wherein the draft shall be presented across the nation, allowing the people to make their voices heard before the final draft is drawn up. Considering President Castro’s central role in the constitutional task force, it is expected that the draft proposal will generally reflect the views of the president and his closest supporters, causing some concern among the dissatisfied members of the public that younger and more reformist voices will be drowned out in the draft process.

The new constitution is remarked by international observers to hold the most advanced and liberal reforms proposed to date, including numerous improvements upon the 1976 Constitution: including most notably the restoration of the presumption of innocence in the legal system, the establishment of the office of Prime Minister, term and age limits on the Presidency, the legalization of private enterprise within a regulatory framework, and the end of the constitutional ban on parties outside the Communist Party of Cuba. President Castro has demonstrated to the people that socialism can and will thrive in the twenty-first century, as the National Assembly has now passed the new constitution unanimously.

Nevertheless, the skepticism of some of the citizens does not seem to be reflected by the broad masses, demonstrating that the Communist Party still holds the hearts and minds of the citizens. Although it is expected that minor changes to the Constitution will have to be implemented, most notably about the specifics of the legalization of private enterprise and adjustments to proposals regarding LGBTQ rights, the public consultation period has been viewed as an outstanding success, with the President pleased to hear that the nation has received his proposals with such an outpouring of support."

The participation of Representative Vladimiro Roca, the son of revolutionary hero Blas Roca Calderío, was likewise expected to be a simple affair, given his own passionate involvement in the constitutional process. However, to the shock of the nation, it turned out that he had different aims. During a routine discussion on the place of socialism within the constitutional framework, Representative Roca suddenly shifted topic, beginning to denounce communism and the party for its mismanagement of the economy, its abuse of power, and its decade-long subjugation of the nation. Accusing even Cubadebate of being a mere pawn of the party, Roca demanded that the people use this chance to demand real change and reject Raúl Castro’s constitutional proposal, alleging it would do nothing but cement another five decades of dictatorship. Shutting down the interview as quickly as possible, the host quickly announced the next topic for discussion which would be taken over by his co-host, as Roca was noisily escorted out of the building barely outside the frame of the camera.

Despite the hardliners’ insistence on such an approach, the President believes a more subtle approach is needed, proposing instead to have Roca officially denounced as an American-sponsored counterrevolutionary, a claim that would not be difficult to substantiate with fabricated evidence, given his own sympathies to the American Republic, alongside the links uncovered between the Army of the Lord and the southern republic. Though tying Roca to the recent surge in terrorism may prove difficult, his own words will be easily turned against him, as his denunciation of communism has proven that he sides with the enemies of the people. However, a third option will also use Roca’s words against him, with reformists such as Carlos Lage Davila suggesting that the party should engage him in open debate, allowing him the opportunity to justify why he believes the country should return to the corrupt capitalist system."

Though this last claim has been more difficult to substantiate, Roca has spoken out about detente with Atlanta on several occasions, letting Granma use his these claims to tie him to the Army of the Lord. This has seemingly been enough for many of our countrymen, with numerous Committees denouncing Roca and maintaining their support for the new constitution, disregarding his scandalous claims. However, whilst public sentiment may largely be turning against Roca, our accusations have only improved his standing amongst the liberal opposition who herald the son of Blas Roca Calderío as a hero of the people, one who like his father is fighting a revolution against a repressive regime, scornfully and deliberately comparing our government with that Fulgencio Batista.

Agreeing to keep things civil, the debate proceeded with little issue as Dávila tackled his opponent’s fierce arguments with ease. When pressed on the freedoms that socialism had granted, Davila proudly declared that the workers had been liberated from the latifundistas and imperial exploiters of the Batista era, and for the past fifty-seven years, social equality has guided the nation. However, such a response was then followed by a question that left Davila stunned for a brief moment as Roca demanded to know for whom equality had been guaranteed, arguing that the party elite have been given significantly more opportunities under socialism than the common Cuban has. Surprisingly, Davila agreed, urging Roca to re-read the constitutional proposal to learn that the party has already recognised and rectified this shameful reality. As the newspapers are proudly boasting of Lage Dávila putting Roca in his place, it would seem that a large part of the country agrees, judging by feedback received from the various party sections across the country.

Leading the charge in the public debate, Cubadebate has also taken down its coverage of the comments made by the Representative, hopefully ensuring that Roca’s little outburst intended to bring down the system will be nothing more than an unfortunate speed-bump. Following the censure, it is inevitable that Roca shall be removed from all electoral lists in the upcoming elections next year, after which he will certainly be sentenced to a lengthy imprisonment once legal proceedings against this wrecker have finished.

Instead, these dissidents have demanded the articles be amended to commit Cuba to the principles of the so-called liberal democracy, opening the nation up to a multi party system. Whilst this petition is naturally ridiculous, and cannot be accepted in any capability, the Constitutional Task Force is all but obliged to respond to the demands of the people given the nature of the public consultation period, particularly considering that the number of signatures is disturbingly large.

The overwhelming support for the counter petition stands as an important victory for the party and as a clear display of its ability to mobilize the people in the protection of its political interests, even if reaching such a large number of signatories has required a number of encouragement measures for the lower-income individuals, and some speedily organized activism from the Committees to the Defence of the Revolution in neighborhoods across the country.

cuba.56.d:0 "Despite the best efforts of the Revolutionary Armed Forces, it seems that not all the terrorists from the Army of the Lord have been caught or killed, as a new terrorist plot in Holguin has been uncovered today. After noticing some suspicious activity in an abandoned house on the outskirts of the town earlier this week, a Holguin woman reported her suspicions to the National Revolutionary Police. A swift, but effective raid on the improvised hideout ensued, uncovering rifles, crates with ammunition, explosives, and five terrorists caught in flagrante and off-guard. All of them were captured alive, the suicidal discipline their compatriots usually display seemingly having faltered, and admitted to be a part of a splinter cell of the Army of the Lord during interrogation, remarking that they were planning an attack on a constitutional consultation in the city. Though the reminder that terrorists still haunt Cuba does not look good, the attack was thankfully halted before it had gotten started. This success stands as a victory for the PCC and President Castro, with widespread reassurance throughout society that only socialism is capable of protecting the people from both internal and external threats."

cuba.57.d:0 "For the first time during the constitutional process, former President Fidel Castro has now weighed in on the unexpectedly dramatic constitutional process, publishing an essay dedicated entirely to the new constitution in Granma. Opening the essay by praising the party for conducting a dignified and sober constitutional debate despite the myriad of unexpected troubles, seeing it as a victory for all of Cuba and her people. Following that, the retired and revered President turned his attention towards the liberal dissidents in a scornful paragraph, passionately and vehemently accusing the opposition of harboring a covert agenda to restore the dark days of Batista, an era still remembered by many for its stark social inequality, racial segregation, and unyielding loyalty to the dogs in Washington, Fidel warned that the soft and appealing nature of the opposition is nothing more than a smoke screen for their true nature, calling on all to reject their insidious lies. Ending his essay by pledging his full support for the new constitution, many in the public have already heeded the old revolutionary’s words. However, refusing to be slandered by the article, the liberal opposition has mounted a wordy challenge to Fidel’s criticisms, stating that it is not they who have a hidden agenda, but the PCC, which allegedly refuses to allow for real change in the country, knowing that it would usurp them from power. With the vast differences in political stature between Fidel and the liberals, however, it is patently clear whom most of the nation are listening to."

At dawn today, citizens all across the country awoke to discover a concise ideological pamphlet stuffed into their mailboxes, titled ‘The Homeland Belongs to All’ and written by none other than Vladimiro Roca and a few of his known affiliates. Having managed to acquire a copy of the pamphlet with little difficulty, considering their discomfitingly widespread distribution, the President has gathered the Politburo to draft a response to this egregious affront. Outlying a lengthy criticism of the socialist system and its alleged failures, as well as the role and responsibilities of the Communist Party, Roca and his affiliates call for an extensive dismantlement of the system and its replacement with a bourgeois-liberal republic. Though these statements of his are not exactly a surprise, they are nevertheless the most coherent articulation of the currently ongoing counterrevolution. Moreover, with this document already in the hands of people around the country, simply ordering all copies recalled will not be enough, with members of the government calling for an immediate investigation into how the liberal opposition were able to print this pamphlet in such great numbers. Yet, with the public consultation period nearing its end, others have argued that it’s best that our attention is not diverted from spreading the message of socialism to all, and we retort with all the might of our propaganda apparatus."

With those responsible fired immediately, to be charged with criminal conspiracy and misuse of public property, this infiltration by reactionary elements is cause for concern. As the youth wing looks to rebuild its press apparatus, all replacements are being carefully vetted by the president’s office to ensure that no repeat of this national embarrassment can happen. With the dissemination of this vile propaganda quelled, the President is hopeful that a decisive blow has now been dealt to the liberal oppositionists, breathing a sigh of relief knowing that Roca and his allies’ access to further printing presses has been hindered. However, despite this success, the question remains for many if the Politburo has made the right choice, as Roca has already managed to get his pamphlet out, and we have done little to challenge its claims itself, meaning that the opposition cause may very well have won many new converts among the populace despite our best efforts."

Distributing our own pamphlet, which extols the merits of the socialist system and systematically picks apart the opposition’s claims, ‘The Revolution Lives On’ - as it has been dubbed - has proven effective enough in dampening the messaging of the liberal dissidents. It would not so easily deafen their message out entirely, as suddenly overnight, a counter-pamphlet of theirs was released titled ‘The Advance of Democratic Ideals’ which outlined a thorough vision for a ‘democratic’ Cuba, and stated numerous claims of how such a system would be superior to socialism. Caught off guard by the immediate retaliation, the government printed an immediate response in their own ‘The Cause of the Fatherland’. Since this release, both the government and the liberal opposition have been engaged in a heated back and forth for the hearts and minds of the people, with mailboxes across the nation being inundated with leaflets from both sides, as a rhetorical and ideological battle to define the heart and soul of the new Cuba rages."

Once this labor has been completed, the National Assembly will vote on the constitution once more, before the approved draft will be put forward to a referendum. Although some within the PCC have worried about the liberal interference with the formation of the new constitution, President Castro remains staunchly convinced that the masses continue to be on the party’s side and that efforts to halt the growth of the liberal opposition have been successful. For now, the nation waits with bated breath to see just how the final constitution will end up."

As anticipated, the dissidents only managed to persuade an insignificant minority of the public, with most requested adjustments to President Castro’s original draft constitution being minor revisions or clarifications, which do not challenge the socialist system and can thus easily be included. Although there were a handful of Committees for the Defence of the Revolutions which seemed to have heeded the opposition’s siren song, these have been massively overshadowed by the number of those insisting on the socialist system and the eventual transition to Communism, outraged at the challenges presented to the revolutionary order. With this reassuring outcome, the PCC can now collectively sigh of relief, fortified in the confidence that they have been able to retain control of the nation and the heart of the populace despite the liberal onslaught. However, until the official approval of the 2010 Constitution in the upcoming referendum, the foundational rule of the Communist Party still needs to be guaranteed, with sections of the party all across the country now commencing one final campaign to turn out the public overwhelmingly in favor of the constitution."

Although the turnout witnessed a slight dip from its typical levels above ninety-five percent, a phenomenon attributed to lingering discontent in provinces such as La Habana, Guantanamo, and Holguin, which were all hotbeds of dissident activity over the last couple of months. Nevertheless, the outcome stands as an unequivocal triumph for the party, which has managed to stand against an unexpected storm and now come out on top. With this ringing endorsement, the PCC can confidently remark that it has the backing of the people and can begin preparations for the approaching March elections without a hint of uncertainty that our candidates will be rejected by their constituents. The prevailing sentiment is one of assurance and certainty, as the government rests easily in the knowledge of their resounding victory over enemies and traitors alike, quashing any hopes the liberal opposition may have of undoing our revolution.

From CDRs spanning the breadth of the nation, petitions and fervent calls for substantial amendments have arrived, echoing the sentiments of the resurgent liberal opposition. In light of the sheer scope of these petitions, it is abundantly clear that the opposition has, despite the best efforts of the PCC, won over the populace. Whilst some within the National Assembly have urged the Constitutional Task Force to reject this input, advocating instead for the unwavering advancement of President Castro’s original constitutional draft regardless of public opinion, such a course of action risks undermining the longstanding rule of the PCC, and would potentially incite mass-scale public unrest. In a reluctant though pragmatic move, the President has instead recognized the pressing need for change and, whilst acknowledging the political risks, has stated that the National Assembly should accept their inclusion in the light of the overwhelming public sentiments. Remarking that the PCC is entering uncharted waters, the President remains hopeful that the new Cuba will still be dominated by the guiding forces of the Cuban Revolution."

As the constitution now inches forward towards public approval, the entire nation has collectively exhaled, with liberals relieved that the President's words were enough to convince the National Assembly, though uncertainty reigns in the PCC, as the party now needs to find its footing under the coming system. Still holding their breath are the hardliners, who have pledged to do anything in their power to prevent the 2010 Constitution from passing with Vice President Jose Ramon Machado Ventura furious at the supposed betrayal the liberals have forced upon the brave people of the nation, with rumors flying that a response to the constitutional revisions will be seen shortly."

Determined to thwart the passage of the new constitution, Vice President Machado Ventura made an impassioned attempt to rally the PCC against the approval. However, with President Castro urging calm and reiterating his points, Ventura’s attempts were quickly defeated, as the National Assembly refused to budge in spite of Machado Ventura’s best efforts. Following his failed attempt, the fallout of the dispute in the party leadership has reached boiling point, with Vice President Ventura now resigning. Proclaiming that he was unable to sit by and watch as the party handed the country over to the capitalists on a silver platter, Ventura now seeks to halt the constitution at the impending referendum, campaigning with those members of the PCC who, in his words, remain committed to the Cuban Revolution. Whilst Ventura’s departure from the Vice Presidency has smoothed the process of democratic transition, his absence has now reopened the wounds within the PCC previously thought closed following the eradication of the terrorist movement."

With the early counts demonstrating an overwhelming amount of support for the new constitution in La Habana, it became glaringly evident that the dissidents now guided by Vladimiro Roca’s words had prevailed in the long debate over the political future of the country, liberal democracy being the choice of the nation. In the wake of the announcement of the referendum's results, jubilant celebrations erupted in the streets, reflecting the collective optimism and newfound hope for a more open and inclusive political future, more adaptable to public demands and desires than the single-party system it is replacing. Whilst the jubilant liberals occupy the streets, steadfast communists have elected to remain at home, grappling with the disbelief that the nation has seemingly slipped from their grasp. However, with the March elections upcoming, and no doubt competitive like never before, many more are prepared to fight at the ballot box and take a stand for the continuation of communism via untraditional means."

With turnout higher than during the referendum, averaging ninety-seven percent, the results have underscored the people’s active engagement in the democratic process and the faith they place in the party. As anticipated, all candidates across both constituencies and from the Public Solidarity Organizations have received the voters’ resounding approval in first the nominations process and then the election itself. The National Assembly has now unequivocally endorsed Raúl Castro for his second and final term as President, granting him a clear and decisive mandate to pursue his ongoing reform program. With a brand new cabinet assembling, the country has seen its first confirmation of a prime minister since the 1976 Constitution abolished the position. Pledging to fulfill his office with the fullest of his abilities, Salvador Valdés Mesa, former General Secretary of the Workers’ Central Union of Cuba, now fills out the shoes that were last filled by Fidel Castro before the office’s previous abolition, although it is expected that he shall do no more than serve as a transitional figure thanks to his age. Marking a noteworthy step towards the modernization of the revolution, this election has shown the path forward for our nation, one that blends continuity with the promise of an ever-evolving governance."

The Social Democratic Party, led by Vladimiro Roca, has likewise championed the cause of national renewal and continues to espouse the views demonstrated within the Homeland Belongs to All. Hoping to undercut Roca’s support is the Cuban Liberal Union, the elder statesman among the opposition, which has presented a reformist platform advocating for a comprehensive transformation of the country. Finally, although the underdogs, the Christian Liberation Movement has picked up steam within the last few weeks following Oswaldo Payá’s uniting speech in Havana, where he demanded the immediate restoration of compassion as taught by Jesus Christ. Given the youth of our democracy, the electoral outcome remains uncertain with few solidified voting bases, and large amounts of voter movement have been registered in the various polls over the duration of the campaign, leading to a great degree of uncertainty just what the Cuban people will choose."

Summoning the party to Havana, it is abundantly clear that the President is eager to maintain control over the party as it prepares for the upcoming elections, scheduling long debates on the best response to the onset of this new era. However, with so much division present within the party following the beginning of this transitional period, it remains unlikely that the congress will take place the way the President anticipates, as factions on both the let and the right are sharpening their knives for this unique opportunity to unseat Castro and secure new leadership that either all can support, or will be powerful enough to reshape party going forward."

With justifiable reason to brand the President as such, pointing to the allowance of the liberal dissidents to have their say over the future of the revolution, the President was swiftly isolated with few members of the party coming to his defense. Even his brother did not refrain from criticizing his policies, however, Fidel refused to go as far as other members, insisting that the party maintain a modicum of decorum and civility throughout the debate. As the critical voices only grew louder, with moderates and progressives using the opening the hardliners provided to accuse the President other misdeeds than revisionism, the President slumped back into his chair, suddenly coming to the realization that it was no longer a matter of if he should, but when he would resign from the General Secretariat."

However, despite the fervor of these calls, Ventura was unable to secure a sufficient number of delegates, as his base was the only wing of the PCC that supported his candidacy, with the moderates and reformists nevertheless backing President Castro, recognizing him as the lesser of two evils, not fielding a candidate of their own out of fears of letting Machado Ventura win over a divided field. The result represents a tense stalemate that has now cast a shadow of uncertainty over the future of the party, prompting some to speculate on the possibility that the PCC has entered its final hours and will break down due to these deep, and clearly irreconcilable, divisions. However, ever the optimist, the President has refused to allow this to happen and has promised to find a solution that will satisfy all wings of the party, to ensure that communism can continue to thrive in Cuba."

This audacious stance, though undeniably controversial, has resonated well with a significant portion of the party’s membership, with even President Castro being observed silently nodding along with the proposal. However, although passionate about the need for the allowance of a new generation of leadership to take up the charge, Davila refused to elaborate on just who he was referring to, with every faction eager to claim his words for their own benefit.

Furthermore, her tenure within the National Assembly has witnessed her displaying an occasionally independent streak, having been the sole deputy to have ever voted against proposals on occasion. This unique combination of an independent streak, appealing to reformist sentiments, and a sense of continuity linked to Raúl’s legacy positions Mariela as a potentially unifying figure capable of rallying the party. Should this endorsement move beyond a mere suggestion to the party, and it is all but certain to, considering its origin, her confirmation as General Secretary would bring a fresh perspective and an injection of much-needed enthusiasm, while maintaining a direct connection to the party’s established principles.

Accepting his defeat with uncharacteristic grace, acknowledging and issuing a statement emphasizing his commitment to the unity of the revolutionary party, Ventura has now returned to the backbenches, eager to chart a new era under the guidance of General Secretary Castro Espín, though still wary of a liberal takeover of the nation.

Deeming him chiefly responsible for the challenges faced during the constitutional debate, Roca, who was already denied reselection in the March elections, now faces the immediate revocation of his party membership. Moreover, authorities have also begun preparing charges of anti-patriotic sabotage and fomenting counterrevolution against him, ensuring that his few days of troublemaking will come to a swift end. While it is anticipated that liberal supporters will rally to his defense, opposing the arrest and declaring it an act of tyranny, the government is determined to swiftly address this matter before it can catch too much more public attention.

Although Fidel has argued for a total mobilization to overwhelmingly crush the enemies of the Cuban people underfoot, the Revolutionary Armed Forces do not need such significant numbers to successfully carry out planned operations. Instead, a smaller expansion calling up experienced reservists would be sufficient, the general argues. Nevertheless, Castro has insisted that the full force of the Cuban people will be needed to strike back against its enemies, stating that not a single terrorist should be permitted to slip through the net.

During a briefing by General Álvaro López Miera on the latest strikes against the Army of the Lord in Holguin, the president slammed his fist into a table, interrupting the meeting with a tirade complaining that they were spending so much effort clamping down on scattered terrorist movements when the true architects of the current crisis sit contently across the Straits, before going into a lengthy, impromptu speech stating that Cuba has been too unwilling to face this age-old enemy and that the murder of Raúl Castro proved that the time was nigh to strike against the American Republic. High Command quickly attempted to question President Castro’s decision, stating that any war plans against the Republic would be liable to fail due to the Republican fleet outsizing the Cuban one by several magnitudes. That did little to dissuade Fidel, however, who remarked that the Soviet nuclear weapons on the island would be the ace up their sleeve. As silence fell over the room, and High Command readies itself for the largest undertaking in Cuban history, the operation simply dubbed: Operación Venganza."

With letters of summons dispatched to reservists of the Revolutionary Armed Forces across the country, the President has stated that every Cuban must be prepared for the sacrifices ahead, but promised that it will all be worth the arduous efforts. The declaration of mobilization has been received with an outpouring of support for the President, organized by the Communist Party, but, at the same time, shock abounds throughout the nation that the country is on the path to war. Already, party sections are reporting widespread uncertainty over the declaration with many questioning what it will mean for the average Cuban citizen and whether rationing will return, but few people question the leadership as a whole, with even the loudest of skeptic voices making it clear that they do not oppose the revolutionary leadership. As it would seem, the country stands behind its Commander in Chief, whatever the cost."

Hounded by counter-protesters and with a confused mixture of calls for democratization and demobilization, the protesters were no match for the sizable deployments of riot police and CDR volunteers, who set upon them with tear gas, water cannons, and batons. Injuries at the protests were widespread, with even a handful of fatalities, with orders issued to get the protests under control posthaste. In a statement on Cubavisión, the government curtly remarked that anti-patriotic sentiments will not and cannot be tolerated so long as the nation remains under threat and that unity will be paramount for the trials ahead. The public response has been largely supportive, which has begun to affect the Council of Ministers as well, which has been slowly but surely falling in line with the Comandante’s designs.

As such, reports have arrived over their exact locations, force depositions, and guard levels. Though there were early concerns over whether it was prudent to steal the Soviets’ nuclear weapons, the Comandante has forcefully dismissed these comments, stating that the Soviets’ continued refusal to get involved even as the leader of their close ally has been murdered shows that they’re not willing to take the Soviet-Cuban Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Defence Treaty seriously. Cuba can rely only upon itself for protection and so, the missiles must be seized. The technical experts have notified the president that they believe that they could get the missiles primed and ready for launch within an hour of being captured, but he is being advised that he should reconsider and, failing that, strike quickly, as Soviet retaliation is bound to be immediate and vengeful once they hear what has become of their missiles. The Comandante is not to be deterred, however, and has ordered High Command to draw up plans for the swift capture and utilization of the Soviet nukes under the highest secrecy."

Though the deployed forces are slowly but surely packing their equipment down, this makes them woefully underprepared for the Comandante’s plans. In one fell swoop, Cuban special forces will seize the missile platforms around the country and prime them for launch. Though informed that this is technically feasible, the Comandante has been warned that the new Russian government might not hold a lot of leftover goodwill for Cuba from their Soviet predecessors and is bound to respond harshly to any seizures of their nuclear weapons in Cuba. The Comandante is not to be deterred, however, stating that the breakup of the Soviet Union means that Cuba can rely on no one and that it must be responsible for its defense, no matter what the regime in [RUS.capital.GetName] may say about the matter. As the High Command is beginning to draw up plans for the seizure of the arsenal under the highest levels of secrecy, the Republic of Cuba is gearing up for war."

Although he is still alive, paramedics immediately noticed the signs of a severe stroke occurring some time during the night, with many guessing that it was likely due to the incredible amount of stress the aging leader has undergone recently. Castro was quickly transported to the prestigious Cira García Central Clinic, as Cuba’s best doctors quickly arrived to navigate the treatment procedure, even though the severity of his condition did not leave much room for optimism. The nationwide mood, in the meanwhile, has only been inflamed by this tragedy, as some accuse the American Republic of inducing the stroke one way or another, while others are growing despondent, hoping to see at least some sort of stability return to the island. Having witnessed two consecutive leaders suffering an unfortunate fate in such a short period, High Command can’t help but also feel a sense of overwhelming uncertainty and anxiety, as aside from dealing with domestic terrorism, they are now also faced with a pressing question - what will become of Operación Venganza should Fidel Castro not recover?"

Despite Castro’s cause of death having been announced to the general public, many of our citizens, and even some of our political leadership, refuse to believe the official version, claiming that an American assassin actually assassinated him, fanning the flames of mass hysteria in the Republic. In the meanwhile, José Ramón Machado Ventura is taking over in his capacity as Vice President, inheriting an increasingly militarized country, faced with the difficult task of conducting Operacíon Venganza without Fidel Castro - its mastermind and main planner.

The primary focus of the attack will be the city of Havana and its surroundings, after the fall of which our generals predict the entire regime will immediately come crumbling down, its reeling government certainly unable to resist once the nerve centre is taken. The hardest part, however, is expected to be the aftermath of the takeover, as the new regime is expected to need to conduct a major counterinsurgency program to combat the inevitable surge in communist guerillas. Perhaps the CIA has never expected the initial Operation Mongoose to ever actually succeed to this extent, that we may now liberate the Cuban people from their oppressors, but the gears are already in motion and the days of Cuban communism are numbered."

Hardliner factions within the PCC have responded by launching an intense investigation, aggressively rooting through party ranks in a febrile search for the alleged assassins, only adding to the atmosphere of fear and suspicion that has already destabilized the nation and sapped the party of its long-standing unity and strength. Efforts by José Ramón Machado Ventura to restore a sense of order to the government have been near impossible, the acting president struggling to retain order. Adding to the chaos already engulfing the halls of power is the startling reports that unusual military movements have been detected in Southern Florida, suggesting that the yanqui dogs may finally be about to make their move against us. Ordering the immediate mobilization of the armed forces, believing that Atlanta is prepared to launch an invasion in the coming days, Machado Ventura is now scrambling to restore order to the party which has only continued to spiral into chaos and confusion following the publication of these reports."

Under the cover of air support from Atlanta and with the Revolutionary Armed Forces caught decisively on the wrong foot, the exile forces are expected to complete their takeover of Cuba within days, proving the PCC’s worst fears true, as the scattered army units struggle to coordinate with police units and the Territorial Troops Militia. In the meanwhile, as these militants fan out to secure the entire island, the Cuban Liberty Council has been established in the city of Havana consisting of various exile leaders and led by the president of the Cuban-American National Foundation, Francisco José Pepe Hernandez, which will serve as an interim government until we can secure our rule. Despite this tremendous success, there are still serious worries regarding the failure to capture the PCC leadership in Havana, as the Liberty Council’s American advisors are full of concern that this might mean the communist forces will be able to regroup in the coming days, particularly in the eastern half of the country, which remains largely out of exiles’ reach. The seizure of the capital thus seems to be only the beginning, as long months of combating Castroist remnants are ahead, particularly if the struggle for Cuba proves to continue in the months ahead."

Mobilizing not only forces of the FAR, but also the forces of the Territorial Troops Militia, as communist supporters nationwide declare for General Miera, signaling that resistance to the Liberty Council remains robust and prepared. With this regrouping, the situation in Santiago de Cuba is dire, as the remnants of the PCC significantly outnumber our forces, with even many members of the liberal opposition declaring their support for the Castroites in the face of what they dub a ‘fascist invasion’. With lengthy discussions now happening over our military actions against the PCC, the future of the Republic hangs in the balance, with widespread uncertainty over whether our forces will be enough to bring an end to Miera’s army.

Remarking that he had a full understanding of the worries of losing a family member, having experienced it himself all too recently. However, this olive branch merely segues into his defense for pursuing the impending war, as he also argues that repeat tragedies such as this can only be averted if Cuba defends itself from the aggressor. Certainly widely read, the country has taken notice of the change in tone from the fiery speeches the Cuban President has been holding recently, prompting much discussion across the country. Blindsiding the Communist Party of Cuba, Second Secretary Jose Ramon Machado Ventura has urged Fidel Castro that this tone might embolden further dissident activities, but the President is firm that the nation must be entirely united around the endeavor that is to come, and that has to include even the doubters."

The house of his old friend from the revolution, Camilo Cienfuegos, on the outskirts of the city. The two aging revolutionaries briefly exchanged pleasantries at first and reminisced about old days, but the conversation quickly took another turn when Fidel Castro began probing Camilo for feedback. Always rather inclined to seek the approval of his closest friends and advisors, the Cuban leader went into a surprisingly lengthy monologue about the last couple of months and the policies he has pursued since returning to the highest office of the land. Touching upon the effects Raúl Castro’s death had had upon him, Fidel only got increasingly distressed as he continued, with Camilo doing his best to soothe his old comrade. Hours went by in the small, suburban Havana home as the two continued their conversation well into the late evening hours. By the end, as Fidel returned to some notion of calm, he only had one question left to ask. And as Camilo sat and listened to his friend, the only answer he could give to the question - if he was doing alright - was never in doubt."

All this activity was bound to be noticeable, and all that was missing was the final order, as generals and staffers both shot concerned glances across the command room, waiting for the Comandante to be ready. Already, they were detecting an increased number of flights taking off across the Strait of Florida, and while scout reports from the Soviet missile sites indicated the mission remained yet uncompromised, it was only a matter of time. And yet, the Comandante was insistent that he needed to make sure that everything was in order. As the atmosphere in the bunker got its tensest, Fidel Castro finally stood up, drenched in sweat and utterly pale-faced, and he issued a wildly different order than what anyone had expected: Operación Venganza was to be called off. General Leopoldo Cinta Frías quickly asked him if he was sure, shocked, to which Fidel answered that he was utmostly certain.

Though the security services will remain on heightened alert for the immediate future to ensure that no stragglers will be able to reorganize, Fidel stated that the Cuban people can now, at long last, return to their lives in peace. While the public has certainly welcomed the return of normalcy, many questions linger about the absence of the war, not the least because of how little Fidel had to say about it in his speech, merely mentioning that the security of the Cuban people had been assured, and not touching more upon the subject.

While making it clear that they do not question his leadership, they do note that the American Republic may decide to strike first and that the decision to call off the attack as such was imprudent. Moreover, they were worried it would send a sign to Cuba’s enemies that the country lacks the backbone to stand up for itself should it be attacked. The Cuban president largely sat in quiet for most of the meeting, letting the generals make their points, before answering that he did not believe that Operación Venganza would be practical for the Cuban forces, before adding that the massive international damage that stealing the Soviet nuclear weapons would have done to Cuba’s reputation would undermine anything they’d seek to gain.

Utilizing his sway, the President has now had the courts see the justification of Carreiro’s lawyer, deeming his years of service to the revolution, and lack of a prior criminal record, as reason enough to reduce his sentence. Instead of serving the full eight years, the First Secretary has now been sentenced to two years of community service, avoiding prison entirely. Although some have viewed this as a light sentence, the populace is largely satisfied with the outcome seeing it as a fair outcome, following the announcement that he will swiftly be stripped of his position as First Secretary and replaced by Juana Yamilka Viñals Suárez, the Mayor of Las Tunas. Though elements of the public have protested the sentencing, the broad masses of the Cuban people have already begun to move on. However, a lingering sense of worry prevails in the minds of many, as they begin to wonder if this outcome has set a precedent for the party to ensure reduced sentencing for its officials, while the people continue to be treated much, much harsher."

Much to the dismay of the President, the latter has proven to be the case, as the evidence against First Secretary Carreiro has only continued to pile up. Having heard testimonies from both friends and family, the police have now been able to uncover that Carreiro’s drug abuse had been an ongoing issue for a considerable period of time. Allegedly, the First Secretary has been taking marijuana for several months as a means of calming his nerves before crucial party debates and meetings. Having grown able to somehow hide his altered mental state from those around him well enough to only rouse little suspicion, the police have also uncovered that Carreiro’s usage of marijuana had only increased following the nationwide attacks, reportedly sending the First Secretary over the edge culminating in his recent joyride. Now faced with amassing criticism for his lack of action despite the overwhelming evidence, President Castro has u-turned on his decision, with the Minister of Justice now giving the order to take Carreriro into custody."

This development, however, despite being long-demanded by the people, has been derided for its exceedingly slow pace, as allegations that the government deliberately stalled to try and exonerate him have flourished. Indeed, the government's prolonged inaction has allowed the issue to metastasize in the public consciousness, resulting in deep social polarization on the issue. President Raúl Castro’s belated intervention, while bringing a semblance of resolution to the situation, has unfortunately fueled the claims of various party loyalists, who now argue that this entire affair may possibly have been deliberately orchestrated by external entities such as the CIA or remnants of the Army of the Lord.

Through his regular column in Granma newspaper, the former president pulled no punches, delivering a scathing attack on the Las Tunas section of the PCC for their perceived inaction in combating the insidious influence of drug abuse within their ranks, not a surprising stance for Fidel to take in light of his life-long opposition towards drug usage. Particularly scathing in his column, Fidel made it abundantly clear that it was particularly unacceptable for the party leadership to indulge in such vices, in light of its leading role in society. Aside from this denunciation, with a diplomatic finesse that is uniquely his own, Fidel extended his critique to his brother Raúl, offering a courteous yet unmistakable dissent regarding his slow response to the crisis. With Fidel’s column reaching public attention almost immediately, sentiments of discontent have been inflamed nationwide, with the public even exclaiming their solidarity with the retired revolutionary’s opinion on the ongoing Las Tunas scandal."

With that, there are two options on the table - either grant Carreiro a very lenient sentence of one year of community service, or give in to people’s wishes and give out a harsh sentence to the First Secretary, preferably a life sentence.

The severity of this verdict was wholly unexpected, leaving many grappling with the magnitude of its implications, as most people had expected much greater leniency, especially considering how comparably minor the crime is. Despite this, there haven’t yet been any particular response from the populace, perhaps signifying that it indeed was exactly the will of the people. However, figures within the Party cannot shake the belief that the sentence was too harsh, fearing that the harshness of the verdict and the overt involvement of the state will only exacerbate tensions further. Disregarding this belief, the Party is merely relieved that this whole scandal is finally over, with plans already in motion to appoint Carreiro’s successor, many favoring Juana Yamilka Viñals Suárez, the current Mayor of Las Tunas, who was not connected to Carlos Carriero’s crimes and will hopefully provide a smooth transition of power in the provincial party."

The imposition of a lifetime sentence, as they claim, is too harsh of a punishment for a comparably minor drug abuse and possession offense, leading the liberals to advocate for the First Secretary's right to a fair trial, emphasizing concerns about the ‘returning authoritarianism in Cuba’. This unexpected turn of events has also cast a shadow of doubt over the effectiveness of recent legal reforms in general, as they faced, and now in the eyes of the public, failed a critical test in this highly politicized case. With a lack of any comments from President Raúl Castro in the midst of these challenges, the future appears uncertain, laying bare profound societal divisions and raising serious questions about the potential for meaningful reform in Cuba, unintentionally demonstrating to the populace that the archtraitor Vladimiro Roca may have had a point about the need to move away from Communism once and for all."

As expected, the Municipal Court’s decision came as a shock to many who expected justice to finally be served, however, much to their horror, instead saw a drug addict avoid prison, while a common citizen would receive eight years behind bars for the same crime. The obvious governmental position of First Secretary Carreiro has now led many to speculate about the blatant favoritism within PCC, though the lack of direct public unrest regarding the issue has led the President and the Party to speculate that the majority of our nation does not care about the lenient sentence that much, making the political benefits of this decision worth it. For now, we just need to wait for the scandal to be forgotten by the masses, and hope that Carreiro’s successor, Juana Yamilka Viñals Suárez will be more capable of keeping the party in Las Tunas credible and on track."

As the government naturally refused to give the protesters the time of day, word quickly spread as protestors quickly gathered outside of the Las Tunas court. Now publicly accusing the Communist Party of holding its own above the law, and going as far as to claim that all of President Raúl Castro’s reforms have been nothing but a change of paint to the same old rotten structure, the protestors were swiftly engaged by the police and shut down. Though the protests were quickly defeated, this reaction demonstrates a clear failure on the government's part to secure the people’s trust and support for the constitutional reforms.

However, despite the celebrations from both camps, membership for these movements has remained low, as the populace remains wary of this establishment seeing it as the embracement of bourgeois politics, and many opposition figures are suspicious of government infiltration within the organizations.

While this split has weakened the Communist Party’s position, reducing its parliamentary majority, most of the bleeding has been stemmed by the decision of both Fidel and Raúl Castro to remain in the PCC and repudiate the splitters, though Fidel did express some sympathies with his old comrade Machado Ventura, despite their differences in viewpoint. Nevertheless, despite this momentary setback, we are confident that this will help the PCC adapt to democracy even better in the long term. The fact that the staunchest advocates of Plan ESCUDO were among those who left makes it all the easier."

As it would be too unpopular to amend the constitution, it has instead been decided to reverse course more subtly. The new Labour Relations Act, drafted by Meisi Bolaños Weiss, would drastically empower the powers of elected union stewards in their workplaces across the country. While empowering our working-class base, this would also ensure that the Workers’ Central Union of Cuba, and by extension, the PCC, would once more become able to guide the economy. There is, however, the caveat that the law needs to define how elections will work. Mariela Castro Espín has encouraged Bolaños Weiss to make the election law broad and allow for open election lists so that ad-hoc labor formations can participate, whilst Minister of Justice Oscar Manuel Silveira Martínez instead argues that only unions registered with the Ministry of Labor and Social Security be allowed to run candidates, to ensure an ‘open and transparent’ electoral process. As parliamentary scrutiny will no doubt be significant either way, the cabinet must decide on the most ideal electoral process."

cuba.135.d:0 "Despite the government never technically putting an end to price controls, the recognition of private property in the 2010 Constitution has led to a large number of newly founded private businesses hoarding goods and inflating prices, developments that have harmed not just the average Cuban consumer but also the bottom line of state-owned enterprises. To respond to this blatantly uncompetitive attitude, the Ministry of the Economy and Planning has instituted a new scheme of price controls on both public and private sector retailers, keeping prices on everyday consumer goods low through a regimen of subsidization. More focused and more flexible than the old subsidization programs, the new policy has more room for market fluctuations, though it is also more expensive to maintain. Although popular with the Communist Party’s base and with pensioners especially, the new price control policies have received sweeping critique from the liberal opposition, who criticize it as ‘fiscally irresponsible’ at best and as ‘outright bribery of the citizenry’ at worst. This criticism has done little to dissuade Mariela Castro Espín’s government, which has continued to implement the policy across the country and fined private businesses overcharging the consumers."

Though the debates were not always peaceful, thanks to the wide ideological span of participating parties, the Havana Forum proved capable of bridging the gap between the parties, spanning from communism to social democracy. At the same time, the Communist Party of Cuba also used the Forum as an opportunity to showcase that it had embraced democracy, though some critics noted that delegates from the PCC met with their communist counterparts more than with social democratic ones. Nonetheless, there were few doubts that the Caribbean left could see eye to eye as the conference was closed with a joint singing of the Internationale."

To that end, a new public pensions scheme has been passed, letting the oldest officials with the longest terms of service retire early, being furnished with a bonus pension if they do so. Already, numerous officials have taken advantage of the proposal, allowing the government to promote younger candidates into the now empty posts, many of whom are party cadres loyal to Mariela Castro Espín’s line.

This backlash has not come as a surprise, but Castro Espín’s government has rejected the criticism out of hand, stating that the progress made since the revolution is irrevocable and that the equality of all Cuban citizens remains its top priority. Although the government refuses to budge, the anti-family code movement has seemingly found some receptiveness among the opposition, with figures such as the prominent Liberal Union politician Óscar Elías Biscet stating that it has ‘some legitimate concerns about government overreach in family affairs’.

Investigating the personal backgrounds of leading opposition figures is likely to give results that are most amenable to discrediting them in the eyes of the public, but so far, there are few indications that they have any amount of skeletons in the closet, prompting questions about whether it’s the most prudent approach.

Trade union officials, extolling this fact, have commended government support for helping them rebuild the organization.

While the party is still challenged by the increasingly well-organized Evangelical Churches and their newfound allies in the Social Democratic Party, it seems patently clear that the PCC has the upper hand against those treacherous reactionaries. In his regular editorial in Granma, Fidel Castro praised his niece and her government, commending them for upholding the values of the Cuban Revolution in the new era despite the challenges presented against them. This praise echoes the broad public sentiment as the liberal parties struggle more and more to hold the affection of the public outside of their hardened activist bases.

Continuing his speech, the President began to address his predecessors, as the President of the Assembly struggled to maintain order in the chamber, reaffirming his pledge to dismantle the legacy of communism and rebuild a renewed Cuban nation.

While the removal of communist propaganda from broadcasts is a necessary step towards providing our people with civic education and plain truthful news, a broader question remains: should the ICRT be instructed to adopt a politically neutral broadcasting stance, or should the government leverage its platform to counter the decades of propaganda disseminated by the PCC? While there are clear advantages to both propositions, with one allowing our government to push forward the advancement of democracy and push aside the lingering remnants of communist ideology, is it worth rolling around in the same mud the PCC did?

With the documents revealing that Fidel had slept with as many as 35,000 women over the years, often at regularly scheduled intervals such as breakfast, dinner, and lunch, this revelation is a demonstration that the self-proclaimed liberator of the Cuban worker is nothing more than a pervert who, more than likely, abused his power and position to gain the affection of thousands of women. With this information in hand, government advisors have urged the President to make these documents public, to discredit the former president and hinder any attempts of his to oppose our government. However, others have questioned the ethical implications of exposing what is, ultimately, mere personal matters of the former President, as well as the personal details of thousands of women.

While his article did not deny the allegations outright, this line alone has brought a measured response from the Communist Party and other representatives who believe that the publication was nothing more than a spiteful attempt at scoring political points, to cover up for the Social Democrats own myriad of failures. Castro continued his essay by claiming that Vladimiro Roca and the whole Social Democratic Party are, in fact, on the payroll of the CIA, stating that their behaviour shows that they are intent on handing the country back over to the Yanquis.

Presently, Castro-era books are filled to the brim with all sorts of communist propaganda, and it is agreed that these need to be discarded if education is to become an impartial and unbiased affair. However, debate has arisen over whether everything written within these textbooks is purely propaganda. Across the nation, millions can nevertheless vouch for the successes under communist rule, particularly their successful advancements in education, housing, technology, and healthcare - denying this fact would be a lie. Yet, painting the communists in any good light within the halls of education will no doubt promote sympathy for the tenure of the Castro brothers.

While a potential deathblow in form of a prolonged inter-party power struggle seems to have been avoided with the hardliners managing an effective, even if not entirely clean, takeover, the image of the party in the eyes of the general populace has declined even further with polls showing that many former communist voters are appalled at what is widely described as a blatantly authoritarian and anti-democratic power-grab by the hardliners, and are now flocking to more moderate and progressive movements.

Amidst the dismantling of communist ideology and its historical narratives, it would seem that the nation is undergoing a period of profound existential questions, with many doubting the current trajectory President Roca has sent the nation down. Surprisingly, the citizens have begun to state that they are losing faith not just in Castroism, nor the President himself, but rather our national history as a whole, as it appears to be nothing more than a series of despots following other despots. This crisis of identity has provided fertile ground for extremist groups, both on the left and the right, to exploit the prevailing disillusionment and advocate for radical alternatives, with the collapse in nationwide approval of liberal democracy driving many despondent citizens into their arms. These extremist forces have now called for a national rebirth of Cuba, rallying against either capitalist pseudo-internationalism or cultural bolshevism, factors they seem to identify with the current, liberal order. With no real way to tackle this issue, as bans would just amount to a perpetual game of whack-a-mole, the government has no other choice than to trudge along and try to find a way to reinvigorate support for principles of liberal democracy and the Republic we all share, all the while questioning whether if by destroying one monster we’ve inadvertently created another."

In his inaugural speech to the legislature, full of visible vigor and optimism, the new President has announced that under his guidance, the country will finally complete the process of democratic transition, declaring that the country will be unrecognizable once the Liberal Union’s term is up, thanks to the party’s ambitious reform programme. After thanking his voters, generally young urban citizens and educated professionals, without whom he would never have won, Guedes continued into more controversial territory, talking about the radical economic makeover he intends for Cuba to undergo, with an extensive regimen of liberalization to, at last, destroy the ‘man-eating monster they call economic planning’. Though the President's optimistic claims seem bold and even out-of-touch to large parts of the population and even the legislature, to most this day stands as a unique moment of national rebirth and a beginning of serious change - which may be positive or negative."

Speaking in front of the Capitolio building, the President proudly declared ‘the end of communism in Cuba’, proclaiming that the superior ideas of freedom and liberalism have finally reached our shores in their ‘unstoppable advance’ across the globe, and that though they are yet to come to every communist country, this is only a matter of time. Although a powerful speech in and of itself, it was rather skeptically regarded by the population, considering how communist forces are still very prominent in Cuba, and even widely supported, making Guedes look, reportedly, ‘very foolish and naive’ for declaring something so bold so soon. For now, as the future heralds hundreds upon hundreds of decrees, laws, and reforms that Guedes seeks to enact on his way to a perfect Cuban liberalism, only time will tell if his optimistic talks of a total victory over communism will age finely or poorly."

cuba.163.d:0 "With the symbolic cutting of the rope, the Cuban Liberal Union has initiated its nation-wide program of privatization, as the country’s largest ice cream parlor, Coppelia, built on the personal initiative of Fidel Castro back in the day, has been sold off. WIth hundreds of journalists present near Coppelia headquarters in Havana, Antonio Guedes ceremonially handed over the keys of the establishment to a small group of buyers, who will henceforth run the establishment in accordance with the principles of the free market. With this very intentional symbolic act, it is certain that more state-owned enterprises are soon to follow, as the Ministry of the Economy and Planning is drawing up plans to sell off all state-owned businesses before the end of the year, some by employee voucher schemes, and others to foreign investors, who happen to be very interested in owning a little piece of our country. In his brief address on the matter, Guedes has promised Cubans that an age of newfound prosperity is just around the corner, although the extensiveness of the privatization programme unnerves many, who are fearful for both their wages or their job security entirely, as private interests warn of both layoffs and effectivization."

In their announcement, strike leaders have voiced concerns of both wage and job cuts once the Cuban service sector is privatized, calling on the government to halt the programme and preserve Cuban jobs. This turn of events comes as a shock to President Guedes and his government, who have been pretty confident that privatization would be broadly popular among common Cubans, believing them to have strong faith in market liberalization and be ready to tough out the temporary economic difficulties for the sake of future prosperity. More worryingly, the strike, although clearly a bottom-up initiative, seems to have won the full, unrequited support of the CTC, who have also issued a statement to our government, criticizing us for selling out Cuban jobs to foreign capital. Although the negative effects of this strike on the Cuban economy or the sales of state enterprises are limited so far, we must keep a watchful eye on the workers, as should the strike spread, our whole ambitious economic transition plan may be in deeper trouble."

With that, tens of thousands more workers are walking out onto the streets of our nation’s cities, big and small, protesting under the same slogans as the service sector workers - demanding our privatization program to be immediately stopped, with those who have already lost their jobs in the process to receive state-issued compensation. As these ever-increasing numbers of workers are leaving their jobs, the strikes are beginning to make a sizable dent in the economy. Making matters worse, the CTC have continued to voice their full support for the current events, and even seem to be mobilizing workers in other sectors to join the strike as well. If the worst comes to worst, we might have a general strike on our hands soon, meaning that Antonio Guedes and his government, caught pretty much flat footed at the moment, will need to scramble for a solution to the issue as soon as possible if they don’t wish to see the ideas of liberal prosperity be crushed under the boot of public discontent."

In a letter sent to President Antonio Guedes and his government, the organization, as expected, demanded an immediate end to the ongoing privatization schemes and compensation for everyone who’ve already lost their livelihoods, threatening to declare a full-blown general strike should these demands not be met. Although the tone of their address was rather neutral, as the CTC has also stated their willingness to negotiate with our government, more hardline-minded members of the Liberal Union are outwardly devastated by the fact that the privatization process has been halted in such as stark manner, asking President Guedes to reject negotiations with the ‘radical marxists’ and push ahead. Vice President Carlos Alberto Montaner however, despite the grumbling of some, has urged Guedes to meet with the unions and convince them to stand down, even if it means granting concessions on privatization for the time being. With little other choice than to do so, it appears an official compromise agreement with the Central Workers’ Union of Cuba is now only a matter of time."

Accordingly, Elías Amor Bravo, the Minister of the Economy and Planning, has begrudgingly struck an agreement that sees a halt of mass privatization in Cuba, significantly restricting the economic room of opportunity for the liberal government. In return, the unions have promised to not strike over other parts of the government’s economic agenda, on the condition that it does not directly imperil the job security of the Cuban workers. With that, a lot in our government, including Elías Amor Bravo himself, have expressed outrage over the unfair compromise and how it will undermine the Liberal Union’s entire economic programme, although the convincing arguments of Vice President Carlos Alberto Montaner about how Cuban society is simply not yet ready for a transformation this radical, and how they should start laying the groundwork for future liberal reforms, have managed to soothe tensions within the party for the time being."

With that, the Senate of Cuba makes a stunning comeback into the country’s politics after almost six decades of inactivity. Consisting of four senators from each province, amounting to 64 senators, the Senate’s legislative purpose will be, as expected, to put a check on laws passed by the National Assembly of People’s Power. Since the Senate will only be up for election in the 2016 General Election, its seats have been filled by provisional senators, appointed directly by Antonio Guedes and largely consisting of liberals and social democrats, although with a few communist representatives present as a token of goodwill. Although a controversial decision, Guedes has promised people that the senators will not block any legislation passed by the National Assembly for the duration of this provisional period, merely scrutinize it. Nevertheless, his liberal advisors are very happy to see this development, as they hope that this will help stem the tide of communist extremism and provide a counterbalance should the Castroists somehow retake power in 2016."

However, a moment of uncertainty arose among the present foreign investors, as due to the government’s recent compromise agreement with the CTC, none of them are able to buy their way into the state-owned enterprises, not even as minority shareholders, a matter Amor Bravo did his utmost to ignore, instead attempting to emphasise the opportunities for new economic developments. Despite these setbacks, the opening ceremony went well, with many high-ranking companies from abroad stating their intentions to open regional offices in Cuba, with the way for a more comprehensive investment scheme in the future, hopefully, having been paved."

With that, as Cuba rapidly moves towards the spot of the world’s richest nation due to our unmatched and unstoppable ideals of free liberal markets, leftist dominance worldwide is in shambles, as the streets of the capital cities of nearly every communist country on the planet are quickly filled by furious protestors, who, as evident by our astonishing economic successes, have also realized the truth of the liberal agenda and are now devoted liberals.

With that, the CTC have also issued a full-throated denunciation of the government, decrying us for allowing such things as mass worker rights violations, suppression of union activities, and workplace safety endangerment. Although some extent of resistance from the unions and their members was expected again, we had hoped that the people would be much more accepting of us reintroducing privatization, considering all experience with liberalism they should have gained. At the moment, the number of protesters is deeply concerning, and though we sincerely hope that the street tensions will decrease in the coming days once the strikers realise what’s at stake, some pessimists in our government already claim that our entire economic strategy has been a mistake."

In no uncertain terms, Mesa has conveyed that unless the government reverses its plans for privatization and reverts course to maintain the earlier agreements, the CTC will have no recourse but to declare a general strike, which would bring the economy to a complete halt until the government relents. Although the government remains steadfast in its belief that the CTC would be unable to maintain such a widespread strike for very long, such a scenario, regardless of the validity of these threats, poses dire consequences for the Republic, thanks to the influence wielded by the CTC across all levels of our economy. With scab labor anticipated to be unable to deal with the sudden onset of a nationwide, cross-industry, general strike, as our highest estimates indicate that only a mere twenty percent of the workforce could be replaced, the government has now been backed into a corner where it finds itself unable to avoid confrontation."

Surrendering to the demands of the communist unions yet again would risk undermining the government’s authority and cast doubt on its ability to govern the nation. As a result, Elías Amor Bravo has emerged as a vocal proponent of standing firm against the threat, advocating for pressing ahead with the liberal agenda, the consequences be damned. While a popular proposal receiving resounding support within the Council, some of President Antonio Guedes’ advisors have insisted that even if the strike lasts a week the damage to the economy would still be severe, thanks to lost workdays and the precipitous collapse of investor confidence. These cautious voices have counseled a more conciliatory approach, emphasizing the need to negotiate a lasting agreement with the CTC and adapt the liberal agenda to better serve the interests of the Cuban people.

Having acknowledged the impracticality of pursuing mass privatization across the Republic, the government has stated that it is prepared to make concessions on the matter, to bring about a proper resolution. With the CTC demanding an immediate return to previous agreements made with the government, there was little that the President could do but to assent, committing to an indefinite halt to privatization. While the decision to compromise with the unions has been criticized by Elías Amor Bravo and his allies, the President’s willingness to compromise for the greater good of the nation has won much praise from a nation weary of constant economic chaos.

With this response expected by the government, scab labor has been brought into work nationwide to attempt to fill the gaps, especially within the strategic sectors. However, as estimated it will simply not be enough to keep the economy afloat, with the terrifying realization dawning on economists that scab labor can plug the most essential of services, keeping the lights on, but not much beyond that. As hearts begin to harden on both sides and the battle lines are being drawn, the government is preparing for a decisive response to this crisis, though what this response is has yet to be determined.

Instead, the CDRs will now be turned into citizen meeting groups intended to further democratic education and cultivate a more robust local democratic culture across the nation, allowing for discussion of political matters both local and national, rather than division and protest, to guide the nation forward through its most difficult challenges. Although this partnership has caught some of the staunchest liberals off-guard, the pragmatism displayed has resonated well with the populace, seeing our willingness to cooperate with our opponents as a sign of a healthy political culture and principle, thanks to our long-standing stance that the PCC must play a role in Cuba’s transition to democracy."

Although met with resistance from a vocal minority within the party, who accuse the party leadership of surrendering to our socialist enemies, a clear majority has embraced the necessity of adapting the party’s platform to better align with the aspirations of the Cuban populace. In response to this seismic shift, President Guedes has gracefully accepted the amendment, affirming his administration’s commitment to enacting further welfare reforms aimed at safeguarding the most vulnerable citizens of the Republic. The passage of the amendment has inspired a whirlwind of rumors that this is only the precursor to further reforms aimed at transforming the Cuban Liberal Union into a more left-leaning political organization, but the party leadership insists that the party remains as committed to the cause of liberalism as ever, only that it is now a liberalism that is more responsive to the concern of the people, and less with high-minded blue sky ideas that do not hold public support."

However, as tensions escalate over this proposal, cracks have begun to surface within the party, with some members arguing it may not be wise to continue this line of policy, arguing that the military should be left alone to ensure the safety of the Republic, and perhaps more worryingly, the loyalty of the Revolutionary Armed Forces.

For the longest time it had been assumed that Payá and the leadership of the Christian Democrats were prepared to back the President's actions to ensure the survival of Cuban democracy, however, this condemnation has proven that communists have somehow compromised the Christian Liberation Movement, and even somehow subverted its venerable leader.

Despite this criticism, the Cuban Liberal Union has largely supported the proscription, although elements of the party have quietly worried about the impossibility of justifying this move to the public when it is evident that a Catholic political party led by a life-long dissident has no reason to follow communist doctrine.

The warrant also declares the two brothers guilty of the deprivation of the rights of Cubans, subversive activities, and a myriad of other, smaller charges. Word of their arrest did not take long to travel throughout the capital, as riot police were almost immediately dispatched to confront demonstrators with water cannons and tear gas. Outside of Havana, similar protests have also taken place, with it is evident that this arrest has brought the remaining communist sympathizers out of the woodwork. With a trial scheduled in the coming weeks, the President’s main concern as of this moment is securing the streets from the communists who still support the Castro brothers. Despite early success in Havana, several rural areas remain engulfed in protest, with some arguing it might be necessary to deploy the armed forces to resecure the countryside. With the final conflict now set to begin, the President is assured that the days of communism are finally numbered and that those on the streets will soon face the same fate as their beloved Castros."

Despite his age and weariness, Fidel’s legal prowess and fiery rhetoric pose a formidable challenge to the prosecution, as the aging revolutionary has quickly found a habit of engaging in lengthy dissections of the charges and the evidence against him, as well as tirades denouncing the government for its recent actions going as far as to brand President Guedes as a modern Batista. Denouncing the banning of various political parties and the arrest of their leadership, Castro has seemingly convinced the judge and jury of his innocence - and even that these trials are a sham - despite the clear, overwhelming evidence to the contrary. The government is worried Fidel’s defense is proving an effective counter to the charges, however, with the President unable to allow the two most infamous communists in Cuba to walk free, work has already begun to pressure the judge to ensure that the verdict goes in our favor. With a lengthy trial unfolding, and the police continuing to battle against the communist forces littering the streets of Havana and other major cities, we can only await the inevitable guilty verdict and prepare ourselves for the violence the communists will no doubt start in retaliation."

As tanks broke effortlessly through the police lines and soldiers stormed the Supreme Court, the scene quickly descended into pandemonium as the judge and jury were quickly detained and the guards stationed inside were subdued. With the prosecution arrested, now awaiting trial for treason against the Republic, Fidel and Raúl Castro were liberated from custody, marched outside, and welcomed by a crowd over a thousand strong, all chanting in support of their liberated heroes. This brazen act marked the opening of a larger coup, as official buildings in Havana quickly fell under military control, including the governmental offices of President Antonio Guedes, who has now been captured and brought to the very chambers he had hoped would mark the triumph of his yellow dictatorship to face trial. Although conflict is still ringing out across the nation, with police forces and scattered elements of the army still fighting for the supposedly legitimate government of the Cuban Liberal Union, it is evident that Guedes’ attempts to destroy the Cuban people’s rights have been stopped, and the Communist Party, now relegalized, has returned as a force to be reckoned with."

With their authority asserted across the Republic and Guedes now behind bars facing back to back life sentences, the military has swiftly established an interim government aimed at stabilizing the nation until elections can be held, with General Álvaro López Miera at the helm of this transitional government. As his first act as interim President, a swift reversal of policies was announced, with the political initiatives of the former Guedes administration overturned, and further privatization efforts halted indefinitely. With Fidel and Raúl Castro lending their support to Miera’s new government, the legitimacy of the Communist Party has been restored as the populace yet again stands behind the preservation of the true Cuban revolution. Although lingering elements of the Liberal Union still infest the state, these loyalists of tyranny shall soon be uncovered and face trial for their betrayal of the Cuban people. While there remains a long way to go to correct the mistakes of the 2011 Constitution, it is obvious the resurgence of communism has begun, and unlike before it will not so easily let go of power."

Despite promising a complete overhaul of Cuban society, the fact of the matter remains that the Liberal Union has failed to achieve all of its initial aspirations. However, the liberal agenda has seen significant strides forward for democracy and freedom, with sweeping legislation ushering in an era unimagined in the history of Cuba. This legislation has now guaranteed an era of stability and a democratic political environment, with the Democratic Concord ensuring an unofficial coalition that will continue to liberate the Cuban masses from the tyranny of authoritarianism. What has surprised many within the government is the fact that the PCC themselves have also seemingly embraced these democratic policies, with its leadership ready to admit past failings and work alongside us to ensure free and fair elections continue well into the future. Despite the President recognizing the failures of his first term, with large parts of the economy remaining under state ownership and other liberal reforms halted to appease the Cuban left, Guedes nevertheless believes that for the betterment of the nation sometimes it is acceptable to not get everything you want, if it means a new dawn over Cuba can break, and one most certainly has."

Although it is undeniable that the force of liberal governance has succeeded in Guedes’ plan for society, the average Cuban has been rendered powerless, and once formidable opponents, such as the Communist Party, the Social Democratic Party, and the Christian Liberation Movement have been toppled, leaving in their wake a power vacuum the Liberal Union has been all too eager to absorb. As martial law is slowly being lifted across the nation, with the threat of a communist coup over, the President has been forced to contemplate the sacrifices he has been forced to make and the battles he has fought to ensure that liberalism could triumph over its opponents. Though the Republic may be safe from harm, its people prospering, and the march of progress inevitable, there is one burning question that the President cannot answer: was it all truly worth it?"

In his inaugural speech to the legislature, the newly-elected President pledged that the time of brotherly struggles, may they be politically, racially, or religiously motivated, is over, as Cuba would now enter a period of national reconciliation and healing. While emphasizing the religious nature of his new government, Payá vocally reached out to all parties, surprisingly even including the Communists, to help foster a new sense of national unity, which must help the country get through the transitional period and properly recover from the times of the bygone dictatorship. Although facing criticism from hardliners within the PCC for his overtly religious rhetoric, the speech itself was well-received by both sides of the political aisle, bringing some sense of unity and understanding to our society that has been wrought with turmoil since the turn of the decade."

In its place, a new legal framework has been established, one that emphasizes rehabilitation over punishment, reflecting the President’s commitments to a more humane and equal society. Having faced fierce criticism from across the political aisle, with the PCC being the most staunch critic arguing the President’s reforms will do nothing but allow for criminals to run free in the streets, the President has been forced onto the defensive as a mounting battle over the necessity of the legal reforms has begun. Although there is little to fear legislatively, given the majority in favor of its passage, the continued opposition has become a cause for concern, with it evident that they will continue to object to attempt at serious reform.

However, the President has drawn a clear line in the sand in these negotiations, claiming he would not be willing to compromise with any member of the PCC that advocates the return of the 1976 Constitution, urging the Communist Party to showcase its support for Liberal Democracy. Although taken aback a little by his statements, the Communist general secretary agreed that her party would be eager to work with the President, with her silence on the hardliners demonstrating an uneasy acceptance of the political divides within her party. Ending the meeting on good terms, the two leaders have found common ground on various policies and have developed a surprisingly amicable personal rapport.

As part of this effort, a generation change has been initiated, beginning with the retirement of senior generals and officials associated with the Castro era. To facilitate this transition, generous severance packages have been offered to incentivize their retirement, paving the way for a new cohort of leaders to assume positions of authority within the military. While some have criticized the President for the retirement packages, they have proven to be effective in facilitating the emergence of a fresh leadership cadre committed to the nation’s evolving defensive needs. With Generals such as Ulises Rosales del Toro and Ramón Espinosa Martín paving the way for others to follow this agreement, issues have arisen with more senior officials such as Álvaro Lopez Miera, who initially rejected his severance package claiming his place was in the military, and that the president is - perhaps unwittingly - risking national security with his military policies.

These reforms marked a significant departure from the Republic’s previous militaristic stance, with the FAC emphasizing a defensive posture focused on safeguarding the Cuban people from all threats. Already, thanks to the support of the National Assembly, the President has been able to pass legislation that limits his direct authority over the military, with deployment now requiring legislative approval, as well as limiting the size of the armed forces. As expected, the reforms have been met with resistance from the Communist Party, with these same members again denouncing the turn away from internationalism, decrying it as a betrayal of the international proletariat and Cuba’s duty to the global revolution, the reforms have been positively received from the rest of the National Assembly, and from millions of mothers who will no longer have to see their children be sent off at a moments notice to die in a foreign war.

His efforts, which began shortly after the election of President Payá, have received official backing from the government, culminating in the establishment of the Cuban Council of Churches, which aims to represent the interests of the various Christian churches in the country. While most Christian communities, both catholic and protestant, across the Republic have been eager to sign up to the Council, there have been initial teething problems, with the Archbishop's anti-capitalist stances putting off many evangelicals who are convinced that Payá has willingly recruited a communist to lead the Christian resurgence in Cuba. However, following extensive meetings, the Archbishop elaborated his stances were not in support of the PCC’s economic model but that he wished to see a post-communist future not base itself on hyper-capitalist principles which would see the Republic be taken from one extreme to another. Satisfied with this explanation, the evangelical Churches ultimately agreed to join the Council, aiding its advancement of the Christian faith and fostering greater unity and solidarity within the Cuban Christian community."

However, debate has arisen on how the Cuban economic transition ought to proceed - while liberals within the National Assembly consider our success with small businesses a good reason to start outright privatization, communists are dissatisfied with the development and are claiming that enough economic reforms have been passed already. Naturally, as a staunch believer in the ideas of national unity and reconciliation, President Payá did not declare support for either side of the debate, instead ordering the party to work on their own proposal, detailing a compromise solution based on the principles of co-determination and mixed economy, which are supposed to help further a safe economic transition for Cuba."

Displeased at the emergence of a rival union, particularly one affiliated with the MLC, this conflict is already undermining labor harmony, as the CTC’s mouthpieces are claiming that the UOCC is not just a worse deal for workers, but also in the pockets of the reemergent capitalist class, who are aiming to undercut pay through gaining direct control over the labor movement. While these tensions have not escalated into violence just yet, they have resulted in clear social divisions among workers aligned with different unions. Additionally, the apparent support of the PCC for its union has only added to the complexity of the situation, presenting a clear obstacle to the President’s efforts to establish the MLC’s influence within the labor movement."

Interestingly, he also emphasized the need for the Cuban government to correct mistakes that have been made over the years, including during his first period in power, to an unusual degree, pointing to several issues such as racial equality or gender relations, as well as various political failures, as examples of the government falling short. These comments, coming in continuation of his surprisingly conciliatory essay during the Operación Venganza Crisis, have been received both as an invitation to debate reform by various actors across Cuba, but also elicited curiosity and concern whether the government is changing its mind on the opposition.

Disagreements with these propositions were quick to arise, as Carlos Lage Dávila was quick to come to the president’s defense, noting that the decisive destruction of the Army of the Lord had proven the opposite. Fidel, deep in thought for much of the debate, likewise remarked that the effective moves of the Revolutionary Armed Forces were sufficient to ward off the American Republic, dissuading them from any further offensive moves against the Republic of Cuba. That seemed to matter little to him, however, as he proceeded to argue that his recent policies would only improve the well-being of the Cuban people, so if that made the government look weak, then that would be worth the cost.

The atmosphere in the room was noted to be tense, and mistrust towards his proposals was almost universal, with few things able to be agreed upon, and a large amount of time taken up by various challenges to Fidel’s rule issued by the opposition leaders. Nevertheless, the President was able to get their time of day, and ended the meeting by stating that this would hopefully be but the first of many dialogues.

More concerningly, however, is that word has reached the government that there is widespread concern over what motivated this change of pace, and if the Party’s leading position in Cuban politics might be imperiled. The local party leadership in particular has been worried that Fidel - suddenly - plans to open up for greater participation in local elections as a first step towards liberal reforms.

The first of many, the checks are calculated to ensure that all damages inflicted by the Cuban state onto the individuals in question are remedied. Though slightly controversial, with some wondering whether this might mean that compensation would be soon to follow to even counter revolutionary elements and exiled landowners, Fidel Castro was clear that the program was needed, but he also agreed that its benefits would not go to people with a proven track record of working against the fatherland. Nevertheless, his interpretation of this delineation proved a lot smaller than what many in the PCC did, with a handful of checks even going to people arrested during the Operación Venganza Crisis, largely mothers whose sons had gotten conscripted.

The government swiftly ordered the National Revolutionary Police to get the protests under control, but multiple departments have struggled to respond adequately to the sheer number of protesters and have been able to do little more than prevent the outbreak of violence despite a multitude of close calls. President Jose Ramon Machado Ventura has stated that the Revolutionary Armed Forces need to be deployed, the ‘rut’ that Fidel Castro misguidedly unleashed upon society having taken deeper roots than expected. Minister of Defense Leopoldo Cintra Frías has certainly concurred, stating that the Revolutionary Armed Forces’ loyalty lies with the Revolution over any one man, but uncertainty still abounds in the Council of Ministers over Castro’s warning..."

Writing that it has now become the responsibility of the Cuban people to stand up for the revolution, Castro calls on the people of the nation to stand up for everything they have gained since 1959, a thinly veiled call for revolution anew. Published without the assent of the government censors, President Jose Ramon Machado Ventura was quick to send in the military to shut down the printing presses of Juventud Rebelde, but the troops were faced with unexpected resistance from militants of the Young Communist League, who had been forewarned, and had barricaded the building, pelting the demoralized troopers with bottles, vases, and various pieces of detritus as they approached the printing building. As the sounds of struggle attracted the crowds of protesters, approach was quickly deemed impossible, and the troopers opted to withdraw rather than open fire to the cheers of the assembled oppositionists. While the president struggles to comprehend the ramifications of this turn of events, least of all how Fidel Castro managed to smuggle this appeal out of his guarded home, the opposition seems to only have grown emboldened by their victory, a handful of sections of the Communist Party of Cuba issuing statements condemning the Council of Ministers for sequestering Fidel Castro away. Already, the crowds appear to be growing, and there appears to be little the government is capable of doing to stop it."

As multiple cities across Cuba are all but shut down due to the massive throngs of protesters, countless thousands have traveled to Havana to join the protests in the heart of the country. Moreover, to the horror of President Jose Ramon Machado Ventura, the Liberal Opposition leaders, after much debate, have issued a joint call for support for the protests, spearheaded by the liberal leader Antonio Guedes, only causing the protests to surge further in support. While the state has deployed both army and police units in an attempt to stem the surge of support for the protesters, there is widespread demoralization among both forces, and many unit commanders report that they do not believe their units would reliably follow the orders of the government should push come to shove. The Communist Party can only provide a tidbit more support, as many members of the party base have taken the side of the protesters, Castro’s influence extending deeply and thoroughly throughout the PCC. As the crowds converge on the Paseo del Prado surrounding the Capitolio, the Council of Ministers is rapidly seeming to run out of options, and all but Machado Ventura seem to have recognised as such."

With the government scattering to the winds, some ministers fleeing the country while others prepare to hand over power to whatever government is certain to form following this renewed revolution, Jose Ramon Machado Ventura has stated that he will only resign once the National Assembly of People’s Power finds a successor for him. There are, however, few questions about who that successor might be, and the legislative leadership of the Communist Party of Cuba have already met with Fidel Castro to discuss the transition of power back to the returning president. As numerous street parties congregate all across Cuba, to a scale as has not been seen since the overthrow of Fulgencio Batista back in 1959, whatever supporters that Machado Ventura and his putschist clique had are few and far between, most staying home and out of sight, knowing that their cause has been consigned to but a brief interlude in the history books."

Even deputies loyal to the putsch seem to have recognized which way the winds have blown and have given their votes of support to the restoration of Fidel Castro, causing the President to be reinstated in a simple vote of acclamation. The restored President was grateful, thanking not just the members of the National Assembly for their support but giving special thanks to the broad masses and his supporters across all political lines for their support, including recognition of his unexpected liberal backers. Ousted president Jose Ramon Machado Ventura declined to show up to the vote, instead remaining in the presidential office to sign off on the last orders for the transition of power, while many of the ministers that joined him in the putsch have tendered their resignations, some of them even moving abroad in fear of retribution. Despite their worries, however, Castro has stated that reconciliation and renewal will be the bywords of his new rule, not retribution."

Despite this proclamation, only a couple of legal proceedings have been opened, targeted against high-ranking putschists and those otherwise most immediately culpable. Most notable was the leader of the putsch himself, Jose Ramon Machado Ventura, whose detention Fidel Castro oversaw personally, who gave a few parting words to his old friend and comrade, surprisingly thanking him for his unwavering dedication and service to the Revolution but also telling him that it is not some static construct that must be shielded, but a living, breathing entity that needs the active participation of all its citizenry to continue. The last couple of months have taught him that. Machado Ventura only nodded solemnly as he was taken away by the constables of the National Revolutionary Police.

The answer to their question arrived during a visit by Fidel Castro to a collective farm outside Sancti Spiritus, during a series of visits to farms across Central Cuba when the Cuban president announced a clean break with decades of economic policy. Stating that the decision to forcibly collectivize the former latifundia and even smallholdings was a ‘naive overcorrection’ in response to the state of land ownership before the revolution, Fidel stated that the policy had been ultimately detrimental to both land relations and the agricultural output of the country. As such, he stated that he intends to turn the state-owned collective farms into true agricultural cooperatives owned by the campesinos who work them. Although the legal framework for the cooperatization has yet to be drawn up, it is expected that lawmakers will soon present the first draft to the National Assembly, initiating the first break with decades of state socialism.

Already, the Ministry of the Economy and Planning has begun to reevaluate its development plans for the coming years, while a separate Ministry of the Environment has been spun off from the previously-named Ministry of Science, Technology, and Environment, with direct responsibility for ensuring that government policy is by the new constitutional amendment. Although some concerns about how to reconcile the growing oil industry in the Mexican Gulf with the new constitutional amendments have been raised, Fidel Castro has stated that he intends to have the government put its oil wealth towards conservation measures and pollution control. While not the constitutional reforms that had been expected before the assassination of Raúl Castro, the move has been widely lauded by the fledgling environmentalist movement in Cuba and received liberal approval as well, with hopes abounding that this opens the door for further amendments down the line."

As a result, initial sympathy for the president following his return to power among non-governmental groups is beginning to wane, many calling for more significant action to ensure that the pace of reforms does not slow down, some still calling him a dictator. It would seem that these whispers have reached the presidential office, however, as Fidel Castro has penned a lengthy editorial seemingly responding to many of these concerns. Commenting on the history of the Revolution and its political institutions in it, Fidel reflects on the legacy of the American Blockade and its influence on Cuban politics, remarking that concerns to counteract it likely led to ‘overly-zealous’ actions taken in the name of the Revolution. The Blockade has long ended, and so had any need to preserve the Revolution from the Americans. Instead, indeed, the time was nigh for all of Cuba’s people to come together and further its goals together, and without fear or hesitation, stating that political allegiance should not be a barrier to public participation. Though somewhat tentative, many have received this as an official assurance by the president that the state will no longer attempt to repress non-Communist forces, and already there has been a marked change in public participation. Official comments from the liberal opposition have been mixed, some supporting Fidel’s proclamation and some yet calling it inadequate, but the fact that they are doing so at all indicates that they, too, no longer feel intimidated by the government."

While this has been entirely legal, the President has made his displeasure clear, causing concern to spread through workers’ councils that the state might attempt to clamp down. The broader government has been quick to respond to the President’s comments straddling the middle line, reaffirming the workers’ councils right to independence but also issuing a series of guidelines for the workers’ councils to further the development of their primary investments and skillsets, to an extend underlining the President’s comments. Getting only a middling reception, however, it would seem that the Cuban workers’ councils are still passionate about charting their own future."

Nevertheless, as access to healthcare remains a pressing matter, the Cubans promise that access will be free at the point of use, only asking us to cover a small stipend to provide the doctors with board and lodgings. As left-leaning groups are eager to take up President Castro’s proposal and encourage the government of [ROOT.GetLeader] to welcome the Cuban doctors, we only need to give their ambassador our response."

Naturally, the Communists have engaged themselves vigorously in the debates, arguing that there remains a place in Cuba for the Committees, just reformed to be trimmed of their worst excesses, but they face fierce opposition from more liberal voices arguing that the CDRs served to spread violence and intimidation throughout communities during the crisis. President Castro has intervened in the debates, stating in one of his regular editorials in Granma that he believes there is no longer any need for revolutionary vigilance, and that the CDR must indeed change to fit the times. Taking the side of the Communists, a proposal was quickly passed through the National Assembly, removing the vast majority of the CDR’s political responsibilities, and transforming them into community groups accountable only to their areas of jurisdiction and their residents. While not necessarily what the liberals would have preferred, the president has made his view clear, and the nation certainly still seems to support him."

Although political parties remain prohibited from running candidates or electoral campaigning, it is now expected that these prohibitions will affect the Communist Party as evenly as they affect the various opposition groups across the country. Remarking to the press that this only came about as a result of many long hours of dialogue with President Castro, Antonio Guedes praised the reform, with even Oswaldo Payá offering some muted support for this long-overdue reform. With elections not too far away, a myriad of candidates across the country have already attempted to register, and the vast majority of them seem to be running on platforms intending to further the Revolution, not reverse it.

Visiting Camilo again Fidel certainly seemed older and more worn, but knocking on the door of his old friend’s house, he was also much more at ease than he had been last time. Camilo was happy to greet Fidel at the door and invited him in. As the hours went by, the two reminisced of old days during the Cuban Revolution, but also more recent history, with Fidel thanking Camilo for standing by his side following the assassination of Raúl Castro, and for stopping him from embarking upon what would have been perhaps the worst action the aging president could have taken in his life. Camilo merely answered that it was the least he could do, and thanked Fidel for their decades of friendship, even despite their political differences over the years. Finally, after the conversation had circled the topic for multiple hours, Fidel asked the question he had meant to ask all along. And as Camilo sat and listened to his friend with a smile on his lips, the only answer he could give to the question - whether he had done right by the Cuban people - was never in doubt."

Noting in his last will that he would not accept a cult of personality around himself following his death, calls for statues and street names in honor of the departed leader seem to be falling on deaf ears. Already, tributes from across Cuba and the world have begun flowing in as world leaders from near and far pay their respects to the deceased president, notably Camilo Cienfuegos, who made a rare public appearance to comment on his deep-seated respect and admiration for his old revolutionary comrade and giving his condolences to the Castro family. Even the liberal movement has paid their respects to Fidel Castro, noting that despite their differences, they ultimately appreciated his efforts in democratizing Cuba over the last seven years.

Once the ceremony had concluded, the casket was brought to the Santa Ifigenia Cemetery, home to the final resting place of José Martí, where the ashes were interred in a private ceremony open only to the friends and family of the departed president.

The liberal opposition group is likewise making a play, proposing liberal party leader Antonio Guedes, who has been the liberal bloc’s liaison to Fidel Castro during the reform process, amenable across the political spectrum due to his compromising stances and political history.

Responses to this demand have been polarizing, with the liberal opposition condemning it as a violation of the right to organize, while the PCC has backed the agreement, seeing it as a way to promote industrial harmony and workers’ rights. Stuck in the middle of the two, the President certainly understands how it might work, but has refused to either approve or reject the demand until the UOCC has offered its thoughts on the debate. However, with its membership significantly weaker than the CTC, it is unlikely that any proposal put forward by them would survive initial scrutiny and would be rejected by the CTC. With no clear course of action, the government remains ever wary of the implicit threat posed by the CTC’s demands but presently has no way to address these demands without escalating tensions further or capitulating entirely to the PCC and its allies within the unions."

When the President described his evident wish to see peace returned to the streets and an end to the violence between the CTC and UOCC, calling the division nothing more than a distraction from the real issues facing the nation and acknowledging its harmful effects on the working class, Castro ultimately concurred that an equitable solution could be devised.

Across the nation, it is evident that the CTC retains the upper hand in the strike, with their sheer numbers alone demonstrating that the PCC still decisively controls the hearts and minds of the Cuban workforce. In the most damning condemnation yet, President Oswaldo Payá’s own daughter has come out and condemned her father's inaction, calling for a harder line to be taken against the Communist strike. However, while the President may be losing the support of his party, his original plan for the PCC to lose public support is beginning to bear fruit as public opinion is also beginning to turn against the CTC as families across the nation begin to suffer at the hands of the CTC’s supposed greed.

Mariela Castro Espín, sensing an opportunity to end the strike and gain favorable terms for the CTC, has reached out to the President with a one-time offer - pass Closed Shop Legislation and the strike will end. Offering no alternative and recognizing their upper hand, the President has not been as dismissive of the deal as he had been before, realizing that this agreement would end the strike and unify the nation once more. However, while peace on the streets would be restored, this agreement would, no doubt, split the MLC. Although a split is likely, accepting the deal would alienate hardline members of the party and push them into the arms of the Liberal Union or Social Democrats, who have continued to call for tougher measures to deal with the strike. Yet, if a deal is not reached, the strike will continue to drag on, exacerbating social and economic turmoil. With only forty-eight hours to respond to this ultimatum, the decision ultimately rests with the President: either prioritize short-term stability and compromise on his principles or stand firm in the face of adversity, disregarding the challenges this may lead to."

With the MLC in disarray and public discontent growing, the nation is heading for a snap election. With the President unable to be contacted, with many believing he has locked himself in his offices, the situation for the Republic continues to spiral out of control, with riots plaguing the streets, the police being overrun, and the ruling government now reduced to nothing more than a caretaker government merely waiting for the election.

However, with the Social Democrats having maintained the demands for a more moderate approach, believing that total capitulation to the strikers would undermine the democratic framework of the new Republic, the two left-leaning organizations have engaged in a fierce debate over who truly represents the aspirations of the Cuban left. Conversely, the Liberal Union has stood strong in its stance of cracking down on the strikers, gaining heavily from many supporters of the MLC who cannot vote for the party in good conscience any longer. The Christian Liberation Movement has nevertheless, despite its division, stood candidates with Payá fighting to retain the presidency.

Public opinion has additionally turned against the Communist union, spurred by the harder line taken by the government. Despite losing the presidency and the confidence of the nation, it would seem that Payá’s efforts to undermine the support of the CTC were eventually successful, though it took his removal from office before they would ultimately pay off. Though this only represents a break in government-union relations, it is evident that it will take the CTC years to regain its striking capabilities at the most optimistic, with this time to be used to considerably reform the economy to ensure this cannot happen again.

As a result, the Liberty Council is embroiled in intense debate over the issue, with the necessity for additional support glaringly evident to all. However, the source of this much-needed support remains a contentious topic. The prevailing opinion within the Council is to once again appeal to Atlanta for further assistance. The deployment of the American Armed Forces is arguably our most viable option; as their involvement would likely be decisive against the Castroists. Nonetheless, uncertainty surrounds Atlanta’s willingness to allocate more resources to our cause, especially given their primary focus on reclaiming America, casting a shadow over this strategy. In light of this, an alternative proposal has emerged from some factions within the Council: leveraging our CIA connections to reach out to the Army of the Lord. These Christian freedom fighters, known for their role in eliminating Raúl Castro and paving the way for our return, could potentially be instrumental in our efforts to retake the island.

Although it is a setback on our road to liberation, which would mean that the only support we can rely on now is unofficial aid from the exile community back in Florida, there is still someone we can reach out to - the Army of the Lord.

However, a different issue became a subject of debate: how should the government handle ex-members of the Communist Party. It is estimated that about 10-15% of the Cuban population held official membership in the PCC before the collapse of the regime, meaning that it is all but impossible to prosecute such a broad mass of the public without destroying our already extremely tenuous legitimacy. The Reconcilers, as expected, are proposing to let these members move on with their lives, arguing that most members had been forced to join the party in order to advance their careers.

The Republicans, on the other hand, shot back hard at the proposal, claiming that the martial law should last for as long as it needs to until our control over Cuba is solid, arguing that putting a definite end to martial law will merely cause the insurgents to lay low and reorganize in anticipation of the date.

As such, multiple Reconcilers have proposed how the Liberty Council is to deal with the matter - in their words, we must showcase our true democratic nature and invoke trust in common people, as it would be the only way to establish a proper long-lasting government that can, at the very least, win the public’s ambivalence. Republicans, however, refuse any compromises and propose a much simpler solution - they are sure that instead of pointlessly trying to get on a hopelessly propagandized people’s good side, our government should pursue the establishment of a strong state apparatus, which would be able to carry out a successful Decastroization campaign and show the Cuban people the light.

Although Pepe Hernandez did not officially name anyone as his successor, it’s painfully clear that power will fall into the hands of El Cabro himself, who will simply coerce the remaining members of the provisional government into unanimous support for his ascension, and punish those who still try to resist.

Having started in Santiago de Cuba, the procession was greeted by his direct followers and militants, with even some local anti-communist radicals and a handful of Evangelical fundamentalists joining in with the cheering crowd. As such, El Cabro intends to end the ‘victorious tour’ in Havana, where the turnout of his supporters is expected to be the biggest so far, even though it numbers only in the lower thousands, it is still a larger show of public support than anything the Liberty Council has been able to muster thus far. Despite our armed forces keeping a watchful eye on this procession to make sure the development is kept within legal boundaries, it still seems like a very intentional display of power from someone we have always considered our ally."

Associated with neither the bygone communist regime, nor with the severely unpopular provisional government, the charismatic figure of El Cabro seems to be tapping into a stream of public sentiment that makes him only more and more popular, winning supporters both among the ranks of radical exiles and various domestic anti-communist groups, various Evangelical zealots being particular supporters of the insurgent leader. As such, Pepe Hernandez has taken personal notice of the development, in light of its suspicious resemblance to Castro's so-called Freedom Caravan back in 1959 which helped gain him nation-wide popular support. Perhaps, as some in the Liberty Council argue, we may now have an evangelical Castro’ on our hands, who may make a bid for power very soon and will need to be stopped as soon as possible, should we ourselves not wish to repeat the fate of Batista’s government."

Before proceeding to blow the statue up with an excessive amount of C4 plastic explosives, El Cabro went on to hold a sermon for his supporters and followers below, denouncing communists for their materialistic atheism and celebrating the fact that with God’s help Cuba is at last free from the Castroist devils. Though obviously, nobody in the Liberty Council is concerned about the fate of Che Guevara’s statue, everyone is deeply worried that El Cabro even dared to conduct an unannounced and unsanctioned public demolition right in the center of a Cuban city, as some argue that it clear show of power and a demonstration of his intent to reshape the country in his own image. Considering the man’s growing popularity and increasing boldness, it is perhaps indeed now or never that we stop El Cabro before he and his procession manages to reach Havana."

Although the fundamentalist convoy was destroyed, investigations conducted after the battle have revealed that their leader was not among the recovered bodies, indicating that he has managed to escape the battle. Indeed so, just a few hours later, the remaining elements of the Army of the Lord issued a video statement featuring El Cabro in his green fatigues, denouncing the provisional government as corrupt traitors to the Cuban people and pledging with God’s help to resist until their inevitable victory. As our fledgling security services remain powerless to find the insurgent leader, even though we managed to neutralize the direct threat he posed in time, it’s clear that long months of nation-wide manhunt await Cuba now - assuming El Cabro is not cowardly enough to have fled the country in order to lead his ‘holy resistance’ from exile."

El Cabro denounced the provisional government for its ‘corrupt, secular, and crypto-atheistic nature’, as he promised to finally bring true Christian values to Cuba in anticipation of the Second Coming of Christ. As such, the Liberty Council is in total panic, since El Cabro’s intentions are now all but apparent, and the armed forces seem either too apathetic to deal with him, or outright sympathize with his message. Though most of the Liberty Council agrees that El Cabro is now a threat that needs to be dealt with immediately, it is not clear if Francisco José Pepe Hernandez is even capable of organizing a proper response in time, as the insurgents ready themselves to enter the capital."

Although the idea is deemed ridiculous by mainstream Republicans, pointing to the ‘bizarre’ assumptions of presidential legitimacy being somehow dynastic, it seemingly and suddenly started picking up significant momentum within the Liberty Council, especially among elderly members who actually got to personally witness the pre-revolutionary Cuban regime. As such, while Roberto Batista does not seem to be harboring many political ambitions himself and hasn’t initiated this proposal, Otto Reich is not yet secure enough in power to be able to veto the proposal out of hand, and his only hope now is that he can secure enough votes in the Liberty Council to retain his power."

Providing a vision for a measured transition to democracy, President Menendez has pledged to hold free and fair elections within a few short years, heralding an inclusive political landscape. However, his approach is not without controversy, as within the government, some are skeptical of his moderate stances, fearing that his presidency will not go far enough to address the nation's deep-seated issues, while many outside still view him with suspicion, equating him with the authoritarian tendencies of Hernandez and Otto Reich, despite his continued assurances to the contrary. With an immense challenge before him, Menendez must navigate a delicate political landscape, balancing the need for stability with the demands for rapid reform, and while it appears as though the President has the political clout and support to be able to do so, his style of leadership will continuously be scrutinized throughout his tenure with his successes and failures eyed by all, his own party in particular."

This bold move, while initially being met with skepticism as many doubted the sincerity of the government’s promise, has resulted in a trickle of defectors becoming a steady stream as the realization the President is being truthful has spread across the Oriente. As public officials process the defectors, the amnesty initiative has significantly weakened the armed resistance, though has not eradicated it entirely, as pockets of hardline partisans remain committed to their cause and have pledged to continue the struggle. While it is anticipated that the ongoing resistance to President Menendez’s government will continue to persist in various forms, the shift from a battle between two evenly matched forces to a miniscule movement scrambling in the jungles of the Oriente combined with the potential for many to change their tactics to peaceful dissent has marked a significant change in the political landscape, yet, even despite this success, many have refused to congratulate the President, arguing that the continued resistance is evidence enough of the failures of his amnesty plan, demanding he take more drastic action."

Seizing this opportunity to reorganize and operate openly, the liberal parties have attempted to renew their activities across the Republic, however, given their lack of resources, their presence on the streets has been limited to the level of small groups campaigning with flyers. Yet despite this, their sudden and immediate return to front-line campaigning represents a vital component of the nation's evolving political landscape, revealing that the President’s plans for reform are continuing to be implemented successfully.

Although the implementation of these provisions will not be immediate, as martial law remains in effect, this interim period allows the government time to continue to stabilize the nation's finances to pay for the new services, which range from minor unemployment benefits, healthcare insurance, to a more substantial pension service. Effectively countering the Castroist narrative that the current administration seeks to impose a "capitalist class tyranny" upon the Cuban people, President [ROOT.GetLeader] has demonstrated a continued willingness to compromise on matters of importance if it ensures the continued well-being of the citizens of the Republic.

This has faced fierce opposition from Cuban farmers, who fear the reversal of land reform will lead to the destruction of their livelihoods, as the collective farms they work on would be returned to their rightful owners. Fearing widespread rural resistance preventing the restoration of property rights, elements within the government have suggested we provide the collective farmers with some form of compensation in the form of a stipend equivalent to a year's wage to help them get back on their feet during the transition. However, hardliners within our government are staunchly opposed to the proposition, claiming it would only inadvertently legitimize the Communist land grab by tacitly recognizing it, and argue that the government should not give in to the demands of the farmers, nor provide any compensation at all.

In order to show them that we are on their side, the National Foundation has decided to establish a fund for small businesses all across Cuba, to help local entrepreneurs set up their own private businesses. Although the reception has been more positive than most of the measures we’ve passed since our return, concerns still abound that this policy will be for nothing, and that American corporations and businesses will outcompete these fledgling domestic businesses. As there is nothing wrong with competition in a free market, we see little reason to take action on these unfounded fears, and we can be certain that the wealth created from this will trickle down across the nation.

If the Red Menace has truly returned in force, then our decision to ignore the initial protests by labor unions would be a disastrous mistake, with the same advisors arguing that an immediate crackdown must now commence if the Republic is to be saved from the leftist resurgence. While many are convinced that the President must authorize a crackdown, there remains a lingering sentiment within the cabinet, hoping that the new government can be different from its predecessor and put aside ideological squabbles.

While neither side has achieved all of their initial goals, the resulting deal is a testament to the art of negotiation - even if various members of the National Foundation have criticised the President for capitulating to the CTC. As a result of the President’s willingness to “capitulate” the union has announced that all upcoming strike plans have been called off, and while some strike committees have not echoed this proclamation, their impact on the economy will be significantly smaller than previously assessed.

These same critics, though not particularly influential among the broad populace, constitute a significant proportion of the administration, with their vocal opposition to the agreement raising concerns about internal cohesion and government stability, with their staunch disapproval potentially fostering an environment for distrust and instability, detracting from the confidence the Cuban people have in President Menendez. With their arguments touching on fears of a resurgence in communism and its potential impact on the hard-won progress of the post-Castro era, by claiming the CTC may now be emboldened to move towards more radical factions within its movement, these Republicans have painted a clear picture that a slippery slope now exists within Cuba, one that President Menendez is more than happy to go down, and that only through their leadership can it be stopped once and for all."

By allowing the PLC to participate in the political process, Menendez aims to demonstrate that his administration is committed to democracy and inclusivity. With the formation of the PLC, various Republicans within the National Foundation have now pointed to its emergence as a sign of the continued weakness of the President, demanding a full blown investigation of the party as a prelude to what they hope to be an inevitable proscription.

Having originally intended to implement this key change to union laws before the onset of the wildcat strikes, the Liberty Council has now approved the institution of right-to-work legislation, which aims to protect workers and businesses from activities that seek to threaten the foundation of Cuba's capitalist economic model. These right-to-work laws will also make it significantly harder for unions to organize in workplaces and further tighten laws regarding recruitment and membership. Similarly, the legislation prohibits any agreements between unions and employers that make union membership or payment of dues a condition of employment. Through these reforms, the President is hopeful that the influence of communist-aligned unions will continue to wane, ensuring that organized labor will stay under our boot, where it belongs. With the landscape of Cuba's union laws now radically altered, many remaining members of the CTC who evaded arrest have begun to flee the country, knowing that the long arm of the law will be upon them, now given the tools it needs to preserve order."

Prominent figures such as José Ramón Machado Ventura, Abelardo Colomé Ibarra, Leopoldo Cintra Frías, Camilo Cienfuegos, and other members or collaborators of the former communist regime, who have remained under lock and key since the end of our return, must now be put on trial and given their sentences, wherein the prosecution has confirmed it will not be afraid of seeking the death penalty. The trials will be held behind closed doors, so as to not permit these terrorists to play up sympathy among the common people, aim to deliver justice and signal a clear message that crimes will never go unpunished, no matter how long the road of justice may be. With a rigorous legal process expected, the President has urged fairness and impartiality in the courts, although concerns over jury selection have brought forward questions whether these trials can truly be impartial. With a guilty verdict expected for all, it is only a question of just what sentences the court may agree upon, however, the legitimacy of the case against these communist traitors cannot and should not be in doubt."

Despite fierce resistance from the fanatics, the operation's success was ensured by our superior firepower, tactics, and intelligence, allowing our forces to swiftly penetrate their lines and strike their weak points, resulting in an operation that has left only a handful of casualties among our brave servicemen. With their entire hideout now under our occupation, reports have now confirmed that "El Cabro" has fallen in the battle, his identity confirmed by multiple captives from the nefarious organization. While some have called for the identity of this terrorist to be revealed, the President has ruled out giving this deranged madman any more attention than he has already received, demanding he be buried in an unmarked grave along with the rest of his fanatics. With the fall of El Cabro and the dismantling of the Army of the Lord, Cuba stands on the precipice of a new era of peace and prosperity, one that the Liberty Council, the National Foundation, and President [ROOT.GetLeader] are eager to maintain for the foreseeable future."

With that, Reich now officially embarks on his journey to implement the so-called ‘American vision’ of the future of Cuba - ideas inspired by his long service as a politician in the American Republic. With promises of enforcing a thorough and complete decastroization, it’s clear that a heavy hand awaits Cuba, as the new regime will be even harsher on its internal enemies than its predecessor was in the initial era of the liberation. The government’s public support is meanwhile at its absolute lowest, as Otto Reich is naturally considered to be ‘the worst of the worst’ in the exile community for his hardline views, and it will be quite an uphill battle for the new President of Cuba to get even just a small portion of the population on his side. As Cubans are left to worry that their beloved country will be turned into a mere resource colony for America yet again, the president is already getting to work on implementing his vision and finally proving the superiority of the American political system to the people."

As such, the government has ordered the immediate seizure of the infrastructure belonging to Cubavisión and stuff it with experienced staffers invited over from PBS in the American Republic, officially expanding the broadcast network to Cuba, meaning that the newly-created PBS Cuba now serves as a non-stop broadcaster of anti-communist propaganda, and various other bits of public information. While our access to the entire Castro-era archives allows for a seemingly more precise and accurate historical propaganda, there have already been a couple mistakes made, such as the portrayal of the pre-revolutionary ‘latifundistas’ in a positive manner despite the nationwide consensus that they were no better than medieval feudal barons. Although the absolute majority of Cubans does not seem susceptible to the messages of PBS and discard it as merely an ‘American propaganda machine’, its existence is crucial for securing the trust of Cuba’s next generation, who will grow up knowing no other truth but what’s shown on their TV screens."

All across Cuba, as signs are torn down and offices are redecorated from the bottom up, members and officials of the PNRC quickly shuffle in, ready to take on the responsibility of building up the political party properly. While our membership numbers have obviously been sparse up until now, we finally noticed a slow trickle of applicants from all over the country wishing to help build the future of the Republic of Cuba, and considering our lack of manpower, these people will be richly rewarded and put in the highest positions we can afford them, while naturally still keeping the country free from communist influence. As such, having been reinforced with new faces and high-quality infrastructure, the party is as confident as ever in their ability to keep successfully ruling Cuba and securing the achievements and ideals of the Liberation."

With that, as confused ex-students prepare to depart the country, not even being able to stay in Cuba with their visas also withdrawn, the President himself has explained that this decision as merely freeing up space and resources in our universities and schools for actual Cuban students instead of ‘foreign spies’ and ‘future communist cadres’. Already, in just a few hours after the announcement, multiple Foreign Ministries of various socialist states have issued protests to Havana for betraying their citizens so blatantly, even if they had to be issued through proxies due to a lack of their official recognition towards our government. Despite the logistical nightmare and another setback in international reputation, Otto Reich is glad to finally see the Republic of Cuba be at least a bit cleaner from the vestiges of Castroist rule than it was yesterday."

This discovery has served as a rather shocking reveal of just how deep have the rotten ideas of Castroism still penetrate our society. All these criminal elements will naturally be arrested and brought to justice for their support of terrorists swiftly, while ONI continues to scout for more criminals and potential traitors to subdue in time, securing our state against those who would undermine it and help bring back the era of communist dictatorship.

Speaking from the stairs of El Capitolio, the triumphant President was proud to declare that the tumultuous democratic transition period is over, with all traitors and saboteurs subdued, Cuba can finally return to stability and work towards prosperity. Although such claims still ring rather hollow to most people, considering the widespread allegations that our regime is nothing more than a  ‘dictablanda’, Otto Reich’s position is indeed as secure as ever, since there is practically nobody left to actively oppose or challenge his potent state apparatus. With promises to integrate Cuba into an ‘international anticommunist community’, it’s clear that our country enters an entirely new period in its history, where there’s no place for a hammer and sickle and anything else they stood for - may it turn out for better or for worse."

Arriving from Spain, Batista formally, albeit reluctantly, accepted the offer to take the highest office in the land, where he was quickly inaugurated and granted a short speech to the people, where he promised justice for the Cuban people against their former despots and expressed a keen desire to build a European-style social democracy in Cuba. Working with a cabinet that had been hand-picked for Batista before his arrival, to allow his inauguration to be as smooth as possible, the Radical Republicans, who now have complete dominance over the political system, appear willing to tolerate the President’s rhetoric, largely as a concession to the broader populace and to ensure that the nation can rebuild after the devastating war for liberation. With Batista eager to begin his work, the President swiftly met with his cabinet to discuss their first steps toward achieving his desired policies. However, despite having a keen desire to initiate reforms, the President has been absent from Cuba all his life, and while the cabinet is just as eager to begin reforming state, the reality of the fact is that his promises may have to be toned down, both to ensure stability and ward off the resurgence of radicalism."

Arriving in the waning hours of yesterday morning, the former President has been interred in the Santa Ifigenia Cemetery, where he was awarded a state funeral under tight security. This decision has been controversial, to say the least, to the cemetery being home to national heroes such as José Martí, if only thanks to the lingering Castroist propaganda that had depicted El Hombre as a deceitful monster in the pockets of the capitalists and imperialists. While a controversial moment for the Republic, the reburial has been one of great pride for the President and the rest of his family, who were finally able to attend the funeral following a second tightening of security. While distant protests could be heard from a small gathering of communists, the funeral went ahead without much issue, with the ceremony laying heavy on the heart of the President, who has claimed that the burial was as much about saying goodbye to his Father properly, as it was sending a clear message to the Cuban people and the world, that the old order, as defined by the Castros, was finally over."

Fortunately, President Batista, following his previous meeting with the Liberty Council, has now been approached  by a consortium of ostensibly reputable businessmen who seem keen to inject much-needed capital into our beleaguered nation. Their proposals, contingent on the passage of favorable legislation that would allow for an easier transit of their goods and people, appear straightforward: a lump sum investment into the Cuban economy over the next two years. Relieved by their sustained interest in the Republic amidst the ongoing economic turmoil, President Batista has been more than eager to agree to their proposals, despite the increased influence his legislation would grant them over the economy. However, to ensure that these businessmen are not like the capitalists of old and are committed to the preservation of the Cuban worker and their rights, Batista has demanded that these backers agree to abide by the Republic's current workers’ rights legislation, and while no official documents were signed, a handshake agreement has ensured that these businessmen will look out for the best interests of our workforce. With the agreement struck, these newfound backers have departed to begin gathering the funds for their investments, however, despite assurances from George Borjas that these representatives were from well-established businesses, the President has been unable to find any details on them, nor the names of the people whom he had dealings with."

Several of our associates have successfully established connections within the new Cuban state, able to exploit the naivete of Batista to begin restoring our influence over the island nation. Having been told that our representatives were merely honest businessmen, the President of Cuba remains entirely unaware of their true affiliations and intentions. As a result, this presents an excellent opportunity to extend our international reach and significantly boost our profit margins. Cuba, thanks to its goals of economic revitalization, offers a fertile ground for expanding our influence beyond our borders. However, such an endeavor hinges on the continued deception of the Cuban leader, a strategy that is not without risks. While Cuba would more than welcome our investment, some within our ranks have expressed clear concerns about the potential pitfalls of this approach and how it would rely entirely on ensuring that our true intentions are kept a secret. Should our deception ever be discovered by the President, it is more than likely that our investments will be lost, or at the very least be at danger of being uncovered. However, despite these concerns, the allure of new markets and increased profits remains increasingly compelling, with many believing that even if discovered we will be able to use our newfound influence to avoid the repercussions of our actions."

Recognizing the rumours swirling regarding the nature of [NEA.GetNameDef], the envoys were insistent about emphasizing the misunderstood nature of the state, blaming the now departed dictator Mike Pence for most of that sordid reputation. Mindful of these rumours, the cabinet insisted that these concerns are overexaggerated, encouraging the president to accede to the deal. This potential partnership with the [NEA.GetName] holds significant promise for Cuba, with access to high-tech industries providing a much-needed boost to the industrial capabilities of the Republic, fostering innovation and enhancing productivity across the economy.

For now, it seems the Cuban administration is none the wiser to the full scope of our intentions, and we can look forward to a steady flow of returns on our investments. However, contingencies are now being drafted for the unlikely scenario in which our plans are discovered by the Cuban government, with various agents working to uncover dirt on the Republic’s President and other notables within the new Cuban government. While blackmail may not be enough to ensure that our investments remain within the country, it will be enough to ensure that the Cubans do not go public with our infiltration of their economy.

As such, it is clear that Batista remains cautious and, unfortunately, beyond our immediate influence. While [NEA.GetLeader] has refused to rule out future attempts to gain influence over the island for the time being, it seems as though our efforts have been wasted, with any chance of immediate access to new markets ruined. While some had suggested sending the Cuban President on a quiet holiday to Belize and replacing him with someone more pliant, this is impossible as he remains out of our reach, protected by his secret services. Sadly, this setback serves as a clear reminder of the unpredictable nature of negotiations and the necessity for an even more subtle and sophisticated strategy for future negotiations.

While appreciative of these warnings, Batista nevertheless proceeded with the meeting, and as expected, the opposition leaders were more than eager to demonstrate their dismay with the direction the government was taking toward reform, filling the President’s head with lies and slander. While the meeting began with a sense of hospitality, with the opposition leaders remarking they were pleased to have received the invitation to meet with Batista, the conversation quickly derailed as Oswaldo Payá, openly told Batistsa that he was being led down the same path as his father, towards authoritarianism and corruption under the guise of anti-communism. While unsure if Batista is aware of his trajectory, Payá requested that the President take a good long look at those he is surrounding himself with. Naturally taken aback by this frank critique, Batista attempted to counter these assertions, assuring his counterpart that his father was an honest man and that he was proud to follow in his footsteps. As the conversation developed, the other opposition leaders ultimately echoed what Payá had to say, before the meeting ultimately reached a stalemate, with the President left in stunned and contemplative silence.

Conceding to this argument, the President is fully supportive of this temporary solution to democracy. For now, the reestablishment of a functional legislature marks a significant milestone for the Republic, with the PAP, under Batista’s leadership, controlling the vast majority of legislative seats, creating the perfect conditions for the Liberty Council to ensure that elections can one day be held, with the Congress gathering to swiftly pass legislation to tear down the remnants of the communist regime.

However, the Ministry of Education has noted that these institutes will not be as effective as the President has hoped, owing to the successes of the Castroite government in its campaign against illiteracy, effectively rendering it non-existent. Despite this assertion, the President remains steadfast in his belief that the Civic-Military Institutes will still be able to contribute positively to Cuban society and the civic education of the country’s youth. While the restoration has largely been praised across the Republic, both its critics and supporters have acknowledged that this initiative may be more about symbolic value rather than tangible benefits, nevertheless, respecting the President's support of child welfare and uphold his values of progress and reform. Whether the decision to restore the Civic-Military Institutes is purely nostalgic indulgence or not, they have provided a small uptick in support for the President, who is more than pleased his allies within Congress are just as eager as he is to engage with successful left-leaning policies, regardless of how left leaning they may be."

While the President’s intentions are laudable, the Liberty Council has expressed a clear concern over the potential risks of his venture, claiming that while the armed forces may have cleared the way of all known cells, this would not stop a lone actor from attempting to exact revenge upon him. Heedless of the potential of an assassination attempt, Batista remains insistent on his tour, believing it could be a crucial step in reconnecting with the populace and demonstrating his government’s commitment to their welfare. While some have still hoped to dissuade the President, believing that his presence in the countryside would lead to a confrontation between him and his advisors should he see the extent of the damage in the country, his determination has left many believing it would be easier to acquiesce, hoping that the President’s encounters will fortify rather than fracture his faith in the administration’s policies."

The return of these businesses marks a decisive shift in the economic landscape of the Republic, with corporate influence, once eradicated under communist rule, rapidly reasserting itself. While the return of these companies has been met with unanimous praise from Congress, this burgeoning corporate presence has begun to raise questions about the future direction of the nation’s economic policy and its sovereignty, as concerns are being raised that the deeper entanglement with American and Canadian economic interests could lead to tensions over control and influence in the long term. Even the President has weighed in and suggested that such a rapid influx may undermine Cuban independence. With Congress and his advisors reassuring him that a strong economy is needed as a foundation for his plans for a welfare state, something that can only be achieved through this rapid influx, the President has reluctantly dropped all immediate objections, though criticism remains bountiful outside the government offices."

While these families are overjoyed to return to their lands, this restitution has not been universally welcomed, least of all by the current farming communities, who naturally feel displaced by this abrupt reversal of decades-long policy. Some of the restored landowners are not interested in resuming farming, instead opting to sell their inherited properties to other interested parties, leading to a subtle trend of agricultural consolidation. Still, the government has framed the return of this land as an act of justice, restoring what was unjustly taken, even if the farmers who once occupied these lands are less convinced by the government’s narrative of reparation. In response to the mounting farmers’ protest, the Bureau for the Repression of Communist Activities, alongside the Constitutional Cuban Army, has taken stringent measures to suppress dissent, effectively forcing the farmers back to work, sending a clear message that the transition is merely a change in management rather than the complete purge of the campesinos. Yet, despite this justification, the farmers have continued to oppose this alleged fire and rehire strategy, claiming they have gained nothing and only lost the rights they had previously held thanks to the installation of their new masters."

Despite these difficulties, our benefactors expressed considerable appreciation for the hospitable business environment that Cuba has cultivated under the current government, praising it for becoming an island worthy of its nickname and toasting to decades more of fruitful business on the island. While once again, there was no paper trail linking these businessmen to corporate employers in the former American North, this meeting has served as another benefit to the President’s economic and foreign agenda, allowing Batista to continue to develop his negotiatory skills, despite perhaps beginning to realize the true nature of those Cuba is doing business with."

However, while Havana basks in the glow of its newfound prosperity, not all within our borders are sharing in the success, with growing resentment in other regions feeling that they felt left out from the benefits of this urban boom. Additionally, whispers of rising rents and the displacement of long-time residents from their homes cast a significant shadow over the celebrations, yet, for many in the city, including the Congress, this is seen as the price of progress - a necessary consequence of development and modernization. With the extent of this outrage being naturally withheld from the President, as it becomes necessary to only highlight the successes of this revitalization project, the Malecón Esplanade has quickly become a model for the rest of urban society to follow, with the President now signing off on further projects to ensure economic growth and urban renewal."

In a poignant address to the Cuban Congress, Batista announced his immediate resignation, framing it as a final act of duty, and urging the legislature to initiate free and fair elections, advocating for a democratic transition that he believes is both necessary and just. With his plea being met with a standing ovation from many legislators, who acknowledged his long-standing service and the significant role he has played in shaping modern Cuba, the President departed one final time knowing his government would continue to act in the nation’s best interests."

In a move that was both predictable and disheartening, the legislature has refused to proceed with free and fair elections, instead, its members opted to elect Esther Batista, Roberto’s daughter, as the new President of Cuba, consolidating the family’s hold on power and maintaining the continued influence of the hardliners within Congress. Initially hopeful that his resignation might usher in a new era of governance, Roberto now finds himself in a state of confusion and dismay, the choice of his daughter as his successor starkly contradicting his aspirations, resulting in the realization that all his hard efforts to dismantle the communist regime have now only resulted in the entrenchment of a different form of autocratic rule. With the Batista dynasty continuing to reign, the President has seemingly been left isolated, forced to confront the sobering reality of his political miscalculations. Refusing to hold any grudges against his daughter, Roberto has instead asked that she not become a useful tool for powers higher than herself and that, unlike he, she will try to abolish the dictatorial rule he had unwittingly created."

As the news of his death has spread, government officials have now quickly extended their condolences to the Batista family, publicly eulogizing the late President as a paragon of vision and leadership. However, these tributes have seemingly rung hollow to those aware of the political machinations behind them, with the very individuals who manipulated and constrained Batista’s legacy now lauding him as a significant figure within Cuba’s modern history. In recognition of his service, Roberto Batista is now to be accorded a full state funeral, a final ceremonial gesture reflecting the official narrative of his backers, where he shall be interred in the Batista Mausoleum, a grand resting place, next to his father, serving as a symbol as the enduring legacy of the Batista family."

Already, the government has officially extended its condolences to the Batista family, with even members of the Communist Party acknowledging his passing, reflecting a rare moment of bipartisan respect in the Republic, made more notable by the contentious political environment at the beginning of his tenure. In accordance with Batista’s wishes, his state funeral will be conducted with full honors, in a common cemetery, marking his departure from Earth on his own terms.

This new framework declares Cuba an officially Christian, Evangelical state, formalizes the Army of the Lord as the official military force of the Republic, and establishes two legislative chambers. The first, the lower house, known as the Council of the Faithful, consists of one-hundred and forty-nine deputies, whose purpose is to work alongside the upper chamber, the twelve-man Pastoral Senate, where the now Supreme Leader Cruz resides as the head of the Senate being granted extensive powers. While his devoted followers have welcomed the inauguration of the Christian Republic, public reaction has been muted, and communist resistance has issued a public statement condemning the government for imposing what they describe as “Norteamericano fundamentalism” upon the country. While the completion of Cuba’s transition is still far from over, and the scars of the civil war are yet to properly fade, the integration of religious doctrine into governmental structures has signaled that Castro’s revolution has finally come to an end and that Cruz’s is just beginning."

With the legal system still undergoing its process of sanctification, many of these officials are slated to be tried by military tribunal of the Army of the Lord, with many expecting to either face lengthy prison sentences, public repentances for their sins, or immediate execution for the worst. While some have attempted to argue that atheism was a prerequisite for membership into the PCC, the prevailing narrative is that these individuals abandoned the true faith to serve an evil regime, which has since the 20th century branded the Christian peoples of Cuba with the mark of the devil, and therefore they deserve to be punished regardless of their excuses. The swift and uncompromising approach has been largely supported by various exile groups, who are beginning to see the Supreme Leader’s wisdom. While there may be a ways to go before the nation has converted entirely to the ideals of its leader, this first step toward ideological liberation marks a clear beginning for the new Republic."

Having refused to reveal the amount to the Council of the Faithful, who have rubber stamped the sale regardless, Supreme Leader Cruz has placed his utmost faith in his ally’s purchase, with Copeland likewise optimistic about the purchase, reportedly eager to preach the Word of Faith to Cuban congregations, with work already beginning to retrofit the cathedral according to the designs of its new owner. With the announcement of the sale having already reached international audiences, UNESCO has issued a severe condemnation of the sale, accusing Cruz and the government of betraying the world’s shared heritage in the pursuit of profit. Likewise, the Catholic Church has been even more severe with their denouncement, as His Holiness has accused Cruz of trading devotion to God for servitude to Mammon. Internally, the nation is likewise disappointed at the decision, with Cubans harassing Copeland’s staff upon their arrival, and protesting outside the cathedral. These childish efforts at disrupting the progress of the Christian Republic have been temporarily tolerated, however, once the Church has changed hands officially, this toleration will cease, and those protesting fools will no doubt be arrested for their disruption of worship."

Boasting that he had brought an end to the atheist and demonic rule over the nation, Cruz extended entreaties to Archbishop Jamie Lucas Ortega y Alamino, seeking to secure the Archbishop's endorsement for his government before the end of their meeting. However, despite embracing him with platitudes and detailing the plans he had for the restoration of the Christian faith beyond the power it held before the communists destroyed the nation, the Archbishop was unconvinced and urged Cruz to instead bring an end to his reign of terror, and allow for a more humane government to form, that can truly govern in accordance with the Christian values that Cruz extolls. Despite both sides engaging in extended and heated discussions, neither was able to make significant progress, with the meeting ultimately ending without resolution. With the Pastoral Senate and Council of the Faithful expressing their immense disappointment with Alamino’s decision, the Supreme Leader has acknowledged that the Archbishop's objections came without condemnation, with many believing an amiable status quo can nevertheless be maintained with the Catholic Church maintaining its influence, as long as Alamino does not oppose any future legislation."

Going further, the supposed Christian stated that the Supreme Leader had continued the communist suppression of Santeria followers. While Payá, the coward he is, has stopped short of calling for armed insurrection against the government, it is evident that he has pledged staunch opposition to the government with his growing following among local Cubans complicating any direct action against him, revealing a significant challenge for Cruz going forward. This outspoken dissent has revealed that despite months of careful outreach to the people of the Republic, there remain significant underlying tensions and resistance within Cuba’s religious landscape to the continued governance of the Supreme Leader. With Payá's movement only continuing to gain momentum, the government’s efforts to maintain control while navigating the reality of a lack of broad support will become increasingly challenging. Nevertheless, Cruz is assured that in time, Payá will slip up eventually, allowing for his legitimate arrest and sentencing."

As expected, the public's response to this has been one of bafflement and uproar, as the construction of the statue was an expensive project, one undertaken at a time when the economy is still struggling to recover from the recent civil war. Critics have argued that the funds could, and should, have been spent addressing the urgent economic needs of the public. However, the Army of the Lord has ensured that protests remain limited in scope and scale, swiftly quelling any significant demonstrations and branding them as communist rioters. The Supreme Leader’s visage now permanently graces the Havana skyline, serving as a constant reminder of his self-proclaimed role as the liberator of Cuba from Communist-Atheist rule, as a testament to his leadership, and a symbol of the growing cult of personality around him. With many loyalists already making the pilgrimage to the statue, the completion of this statue demonstrates another step towards the total reshaping of Cuba’s identity, with it slowly embracing evangelical rule."

Supreme Leader Cruz, having traveled to the Oriente to see the success of his armed forces for himself, has decreed that these individuals must atone for their sins and meet their fate before the Lord. In a brutal and public display of power, Cruz’s followers carried out mass executions in baseball stadiums and other public sites, painting the entire region red with the blood of the condemned. Despite the effectiveness of this operation and the eradication of another sect of communist sympathizers, the nation is undoubtedly horrified by these events, with the graphic nature of the executions shocking many and instilling a climate of fear. Embracing this fear, the Supreme Leader has basked in this response, arguing that fear is a necessary emotion for the values of faith and compliance to be instilled into the remaining non-believers spread across the Republic. While others have lapped up the ongoing purge against the atheist and communist scourge, this operation and its aftermath highlight the severe and authoritarian measures the government is willing to employ to ensure its total control.

In alignment with this belief, all previously designated protected areas, including the Zapata National Park, have been opened for economic development and resource extraction following a decree by the Council of the Faithful. As expected, environmentalists have attempted to protest these measures, voicing concerns over the potential ecological impact, however, despite these objections, substantial interest from large corporations such as Orecorp has already materialized. As such, any prolonged protest will soon enough run into the bulldozers and other mechanical aides of these foreign companies, who now stand eager to acquire permits for accessing these exclusive resources sites. Maintaining that if God did not intend his flock to utilize these resources they would not be there, the Supreme Leader has urged companies across the Republic to follow the example of their international counterparts and begin to petition for access to the use of this land, arguing that through the combination of international and internal investment, the scars of the civil war may finally fade, even if some will continue to complain that we have interpreted God’s gift to mankind incorrectly and that we should instead focus on preservation rather than so-called exploitation."

Already, attempts by underground unions to organize against this new labor regulation have been swiftly crushed by the Army of the Lord, with Supreme Leader Cruz receiving expressions of gratitude from various business leaders, who have praised the policy for truly allowing them to unleash their entrepreneurial spirit and potential. Yet, despite the backing of businesses, widespread concerns have persisted among the general populace, with many complaining that it is an inhumane practice, with the Supreme Leader merely pointing to Exodus 23:12 as justification for the new legislation. Despite the unrest, the government maintains that the policy is for the benefit of the people’s good, emphasizing the spiritual fulfillment and economic revival that will come from the hard labor of the nation’s workforce. However, until the workforce adapts to the new changes, it is expected that economic output will slump temporarily as the sin of sloth struggles to relinquish its hold over the workers of the Republic."

In response to this economic disarray, Supreme Leader Cruz has called for an immediate summit with major evangelical religious and business leaders in the vacation paradise of Varadero to discuss a permanent solution to this issue. The proposed solution is straightforward yet innovative, with the consensus being that from now on, the government will pursue the establishment of religious foundations across the Republic, which will be responsible for the distribution of charity and alms to the people and thus exempt from taxes. In reality, these foundations will be granted total control and responsibility over specific economic sectors, ranging from steel, oil extraction, tourism, and more. Through the delegation of economic control to these faith-based entities, the government aims to ensure both economic stability and the proliferation of evangelical values throughout the nation, however, the success of these foundations is yet to be seen. While some have viewed this consolidation of power with skepticism, seeing it as once again the promotion of the Evangelical community over the Catholic citizens of the Republic, the Council of the Faithful has heralded the summit as providing a reliable framework for economic growth and spiritual renewal, providing a clear alternative to the atheist machinations of central planning."

As the storm carved a destructive path through the Caribbean, wreaking havoc on Haiti before veering towards the southeastern United States, its impact has been felt acutely across our infrastructure, leading to widespread devastation. However, thanks to the proactive measures undertaken by the government, most residents in vulnerable areas were evacuated well ahead of the storm's arrival. Well-coordinated shelters were established in Santiago de Cuba and other key cities, providing refuge for those unable or unwilling to leave their homes. While the damage is extensive- affecting roads, power lines, and essential services - the death toll remains remarkably low, with only four lives lost - a testament to our effective emergency response strategies and the dedication of our civil defense force. As the winds subside and initial assessments begin, we are now poised to initiate swift reconstruction efforts, with a priority being placed on the return of displaced communities.

The government’s response has been widely criticized by the populace, despite the quick response of the emergency services, and the armed forces’ preparations for the hurricane were notably inadequate, with some pointing out that the PCC had begun to increase funding for hurricane defenses following the devastation Hurricane Carlos had left merely six years ago in Central America. This frustration has only been further exacerbated by the fact that the Supreme Leader has been noticeably absent during the critical period leading up to the storm, as well as its immediate aftermath. Despite these challenges, the situation is gradually stabilizing as the relentless winds and torrential rains have now ceased, allowing for the beginning of recovery and reconstruction efforts. However, while a sense of camaraderie has begun to develop among the people of the Oriente, questions are now lingering about whether the government is capable of defending the Republic in the future and just where the Supreme Leader was during multiple meetings of the Pastoral Senate over the past week."

Once again, the government’s attempts at damage control have proven futile, by scapegoating several ministers, the administration has hoped to deflect blame for the Supreme Leader’s actions, however, as these ministers remained in the country during the crisis, unlike Cruz, and were briefly notable in the press for criticizing hurricane preparations before Cruz’s return, the gesture has done little to placate the public. As the situation only continues to escalate, the Pastoral Senate has turned once more to Cruz for answers, yet with the legitimacy of the Christian Republic being called into question, and the once-unshakable faith in Cruz’s leadership crumbling, it seems as though there is only one solution to this problem as the Supreme Leader now seeks to take a page out of his predecessor's books."

With thousands beaten into submission, these scenes of violence have now forced the opposition movement to retreat from Santiago de Cuba, with the streets once more belonging to the Supreme Leader and the loyal Evangelical forces of the Christian Republic. However, this heavy-handed approach has done little to bolster the government’s standing. While the immediate threat of protest has been quelled, the aftermath has left the government in a precarious position. The deployment of the Army of the Lord, coupled with the narrow escape of the MLC leader Oswaldo Payá, has now brought widespread condemnation as even the Evangelical Churches, traditionally stalwart allies of Cruz, have voiced critique at the harshness of the tactics. As the images of violence and repression spread across the Republic, many citizens are beginning to feel alienated by the government, regarding the Supreme Leader’s government as nothing more than a rebranding of its predecessor.

Despite his objections, the proposal, however, has seemingly aroused Ortega’s interest in the field, as he has proposed an idea for how to prove Kola Shaler’s superiority to the entire continent, hoping to secure a lucrative market share for ourselves. Already receiving some support from the Minister of Industry and Commerce, Ortega has suggested that we must instead try and outcompete the Cubans and seize the Latin American market for ourselves, cornering it with our superior cola brand!"

However, as discussions unfolded, it was revealed that the proposed deal was vetoed by President Daniel Ortega for unknown reasons. Though some have speculated his decision links to their desire to protect their own domestic cola production, it is still an unusual move from our fraternal ally. Despite this unfortunate setback, the rest of the Latin American market seems ready for more trade negotiations with us, indicating that our regional cola export business is continuing to thrive, even without such an important trade partner as Centroamerica. With the government remaining hopeful that President Ortega will warm up to our proposal in time and let TuKola enter the shelves of Centroamerican stores after all, our other exports have continued unabated across Latin America, with consumers responding positively to our products, as we had hoped."

Hopes are high for its success, especially considering the number of advertisements we have been running in cities across Latin America to promote the beverage. Though the Cubans, who will surely notice this development, may become wary of the competition, seeing our entry into the market as an economic provocation. While they may have a point, as we deliberately made Kola Shaler cheaper than Havana’s TuKola, President Ortega does not view any potential discontent as a major concern. The start of our international sales is set to begin in just a few days, and so the only thing left for us to do now is to hope that this little friendly competition will not spiral out of control."

Detailed within the lengthy proposal is the most intriguing and tantalizing detail, in that the Centroamerican government's offer for Kola Shaler has a lower production price, and thus a lower sales price, allowing more of our consumers to purchase it. Twenty-five percent cheaper, the significantly lower importation cost has caught many off guard, with some suspecting that Managua intends to jack up the prices once they’ve become a dominant market force. It is obvious to even an inexperienced economist that the Centroamerican government is trying to undercut Cuba out of this market, and that our involvement risks deepening a potential trade war between the two. However, this is simply not our concern. The most important benefactor, should we agree to Central America’s offer, is our consumers, who would appreciate a more diverse selection of beverages during the hot summer months, among other benefits. Whilst diversification is always welcome, should we damage our relations with Cuba all for the sake of slightly cheaper soda?"

Managua’s rather unconventional approach to business has caught our trade officials off guard, considering their startling attempts to  undercut our economic interests. While our trade partners are free to conduct their business as they please, the sudden arrival of an alternative, unfeasibly cheaper product has been viewed as antagonistically competitive. Although nobody has yet to actively tear up our trade agreements, there is a genuine worry that Kola Shaler will soon replace TuKola in most, if not all, markets across the South due to the sheer price difference. With no way to counter this cheap alternative without running Los Portales S.A. at a massive loss, our industries must find a way to remain the number one consumed product on the Cola market before it is too late and our brand is replaced for good."

Kola Shaler, in recent weeks, has managed to enter many Latin American markets, where they now clearly have a significant advantage over our TuKola brand simply by how much cheaper their cola is, sometimes reaching absurdly low prices just to outcompete our product. While technically speaking, Centroamerica has every legal right to do so, such odd, spiteful, and unexplained behavior has been remarked to be outright childish by some of our more curt officials. It is expected that they are becoming increasingly ready to use more and more petty foul play to gain the upper hand, in what seemed to be nothing but a ‘friendly competition’. For now, while our marketing experts at Los Portales S.A. are brainstorming ideas on how to properly counterattack, from new flavour variants to radical propositions for how to reduce production costs, we are apparently forced to find an answer to the trade war Ortega seems so intent on instigating."

Already enjoyed by consumers across Cuba, the differences in taste compared to the variant containing sugar winning it its own loyal segment of consumers. As many of our medical experts have also stated that there exist the clear health benefits of consuming TuKola Dietética compared to Kola Shaler, our advertising campaign has emphasized these claims, ensuring that Latin American customers can make informed decisions.

From now on, it seems that Managua will have to invest even more funds into this trade war just to at least not end up humiliated, defeated, and worse, having lost out on an increasingly growing investment range. As such, presidential advisors have rolled out a promising plan to deal with the Cubans: We shall simply hold a taste test with our most trustworthy soft drink connoisseurs, which shall once and for all prove how Kola Shaler is the superior option. Ortega himself, however, has had a more radical idea, that being to fire up a massive propaganda campaign to convince consumers that TuKola is nothing more than an ‘imperialist drink’, just as Coca Cola once was.

Kola Shaler, however, turned out to be much more refreshing, with just the right amount of sweetness and a more clear taste. Naturally, our press agencies have been forwarded these findings as well, preparing to publicize them internationally.

Broadcasting this affair, media outlets across the nation have branded TuKola as a copy of the old capitalist soft drink, arguing that it is nothing more than a copied recipe, and denouncing its higher prices as a direct attempt to restore the notions of capitalist greed and exploitation across Latin America.

Nevertheless, their recent moves of blatant hostility towards our economic interests cannot be tolerated, and as such, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Investments has immediately moved to completely block off the importation of Centroamerican goods on Raúl Castro’s direct orders. Having been deemed a painful yet necessary measure, it is the last and only way we can show Ortega that the Cuban nation will never bow to pointless bullying, not even if it comes from who we thought to be our closest friends and allies."

Showing our delegation both their state institutions and neighborhoods in the capital city, the Haitians have proudly demonstrated how well the country has been rebuilding since the 2011 earthquake, all thanks to the close economic ties with Cuba. Additionally, the visit has also seen an emphasis on the close cultural ties between the two countries, exemplified among other things by the Haitian Cubans who trace their heritage to Haiti, many of whom are still in contact with family on the other side of the Windward Passage. Ending off a pleasant visit by entertaining a state dinner with [HAI.GetLeader], [ROOT.GetLeader], having sampled much of local cuisine, has concluded that the meeting was a ‘tremendous success for the bilateral relations of the two nations’, promising to further expand our trade and diplomatic ties in the name of the ‘unbreakable Caribbean brotherhood’."

Although decades of mutual enmity will be not be overcome in a day, if nothing else in the mind of the public, this olive branch makes a good first step.

Although there have been worries from some of the smaller Caribbean countries that we would inevitably dominate the union as the member with the largest economy, there is a clear consensus that our presence within the Community would be beneficial to everyone, as the Treaty of Chaguaramas will reassure the smaller countries that we cannot singlehandedly dominate the entire community.

Although such treachery was to be expected in light of the hostile tones coming out of Havana recently, we never expected such blatant pan-Caribbean imperialism to spring up so swiftly, confounding our government and forcing us to respond to the Cuban demand sooner rather than later. As much as we would like to stand up for our Bolivarian ally, the Cuban army is one of the strongest in the region, causing some in military command to advise us that should we try to resist, the Cubans are liable to defeat us in a full scale conflict, risking the same fate befalls our country as the ABC Islands.

Should we back off on the other hand, it would compromise our international credibility and simply make our government look weak for not standing by its demands, even if that’s the cost for avoiding a devastating large-scale war with Venezuela, which will quite possibly require us to invade the Venezuelan mainland to reach any kind of conclusion to the war.

With the Venezuelan stooges departing the country into exile, and the Caracas regime humiliated, all that is left for us is celebrate this proud foreign policy victory, which is sure to shore up our domestic support and cement our position as the regional hegemon, even if this standoff against an erstwhile ally has created mixed feelings and unease among parts of our population."

The issue has proven significantly controversial within our government, as despite the natural concerns of us losing our sovereignty and nationhood for a rather vague concept of ‘Caribbean unity’, many find themselves tacitly supportive of the idea, mostly for the economic benefits that would follow and the idea of being protected by the strength of the Cuban military.

In a significant move, the ministry has updated the curriculum for all schools, mandating that they prioritize the teaching of the three dominant languages of the Caribbean: Spanish, English, and French from the earliest grades. While Spanish is of course ubiquitous, the resolution addresses longstanding gaps in language education, particularly the reduced emphasis placed on English since the revolution and the limited presence of French instruction. Beginning at the start of the next school year, students across Cuba will be immersed in a comprehensive curriculum aimed at achieving proficiency in all three languages, in the hope of fostering deeper regional ties and preparing Cuban citizens for their role in the ever-evolving Caribbean community. While concerns have risen surrounding the difficulties of students learning two new languages, and some wondering whether this will come at the expense of other classes, making it harder for students to learn everything they need to learn, the Ministry for Education is confident in the abilities of our teacher’s and students to comfortably adjust to the new curriculum, especially when other states already have students learn two languages."

As expected, Cuban legal experts have played a pivotal role in shaping the final package, known as the Antillean Integration Bill, offering crucial guidance and expertise drawn from their legislative evolution.

While such a move has been off-putting for some of our representatives and our regional partners, who believe that MINREX’s role in the drafting of the integration bill is undermining the narrative of unity presented by them, such concerns have largely been dismissed because many of our allies have respected our position as the driving force of unification, seeing that without our guidance the dream of a united Antilles would never even have been discussed in the first place. With this critical phase of integration completed, MINREX has begun to turn its attention towards the next stage necessary for federalization: drafting the inter-state framework that will formalize the structure of the emerging federation.

For many across the Caribbean, it is unconscionable to leave Puerto Rico under what they view as foreign occupation, bound to a fading power that clings to an imperialist past. In response, calls have grown louder for a joint Caribbean military operation to liberate the island and bring the territory of the American Republic under the fold of a unified Caribbean federation. However, such an initiative is fraught with risk. The American Republic, while no longer the superpower it once was, still commands a formidable military presence in the region, particularly its navy, which far exceeds the combined strength of all Caribbean forces. Any confrontation could lead to severe military and economic backlash, jeopardizing not only the unification process but also the fragile stability that has been achieved in the region. This leaves us with a difficult choice: pursue the moral imperative of liberation, risking the wrath of Atlanta, or focus on consolidating unity within our borders, leaving Puerto Rico’s fate undecided."

Though anti-colonial sentiment runs deep, and the moral case for liberating Puerto Rico is strong, many within our government are concerned about our capacity to wage such a conflict. While we are prepared to assist with a ground invasion, the matter of landing on Puerto Rico is a different matter altogether, with our navy a fraction of the size of Atlanta’s. However, some have deemed this struggle to be a necessity to finally liberate the people of the Antilles from the grasp of European and American imperialism. As a result of this David versus Goliath scenario, our government has been brought to a near pause over the issue. While there are benefits of both rejecting and supporting the invasion, a successful invasion would have to be both quick and precise, with it more than likely that if we fail to secure a landing the first time around, the war will drag on until either a ceasefire is declared or American boots once more march in Havana."

However, despite this rejection to partake in direct conflict, our allies have assured us that they will open their hospitals to our soldiers, and to all others who have wished to partake in the venture for the liberation of Puerto Rico, seeing it as the least they can do without drawing too much attention to themselves from Atlanta. Yet, even this decision has been met with fierce criticism from hawkish voices, with oppositional factions accusing the government of betraying the cause of Caribbean solidarity out of fear of an enemy that the united Caribbean can surely take on and win.

The sight of the federation banner, rather than an individual national flag, flying over the island serves as a potent symbol of the united front that has conducted this campaign and a reminder of all of the fate that awaits their forces should they seek to impede on our independence. However, this victory has not come without its complexities. While pockets of Puerto Rico’s population have welcomed the liberation forces, turning out to support the Antillean Federation, a significant portion of the island has shown signs of resistance both passive and active. As a result, guerilla campaigns persist across San Juan and much of the countryside, while order tensely remains in the cities.

While the loss of Puerto Rico, a key American territory for over a century, would undoubtedly sting, the envoys’ demands have otherwise been restrained, refusing to call for reparations or demilitarization. While it would be simple to agree to these demands and never again have to deal with the Antilles, who are seemingly poised to unify their alliance into a federation of states, there is the matter of our own pride on the line. These territories have been part of America for over a century, and handing them over to a rag-tag group of socialists and fellow travellers will be little more than a spit in the face of those who fought and died to liberate them from the tyranny of Spanish oppression. With public opinion seemingly mixed on the matter, with many demanding a bitter fight until the end against the Antilles coalition, a decision must be made soon if we are to both save face or begin preparation for an immediate counterattack."

Already, a transitional government, with expected strong ties to Havana, has been established with the expressed aim of guiding Puerto Rico toward a stable, independent future. This new administration, while in its infancy, has now fully committed itself to the ideals of Caribbean unity and integration with President [PUE.GetLeader] meeting with [CUB.GetLeader] to sign the already drafted documentation that has begun the federalization of the Antilles. Though challenges lie ahead with issues chiefly surrounding the difficulties of managing expectations, rebuilding infrastructure, and securing political stability, our efforts are already showing promise.

Despite the grim outlook from some of our allies, there is reason for cautious optimism. Thus far, our forces have successfully held off American advances, and crucially, we have been able to outmaneuver their powerful navy - a critical factor in maintaining control over the region. With their naval dominance under immense pressure and reports that the USS H.W. Bush has been forced to dock for repairs, we retain a genuine chance of emerging victorious, albeit at a significant cost. Moreover, as the once-fractured American territories inch closer towards reunification, it may weaken the resolve of the Atlanta regime to maintain its Caribbean ambitions should it find itself at war with a second regional power in the former United States.

By extending an olive branch to these countries, the Federation could signal its commitment to inclusion, as well as to the political and economic stability of the entire region. On the other hand, some critics warn of overreach.

However, there are equally strong reservations. We have historically guarded our sovereignty and made it clear that we do not share the same dreams as Havana, or the rest of the Caribbean does for the pan-Caribbean aspirations, despite the benefits it would bring.

As the other oppressed people of Iberia continue their advance against the fascist regime in Madrid, we can only hope that this equipment is enough to secure our and our ally's independence from centuries of oppression, allowing us to at last rebuild and restore our identities free of cultural genocide and tyranny of a foreign crown."

cuba.388.d1:0 "In a significant development for our struggle, ships flying the Cuban flag have docked in our ports, bringing with them a much-needed influx of arms, equipment, and military advisors to bolster our fight against the remnants of Francoism. This tangible support from the Caribbean represents a clear turning point in our efforts to rebuild the Republic and vanquish the vestiges of dictatorship. The Cuban vessels, as they unload their shipments, appear not only efficient but driven by a clear sense of purpose. Their fervor for justice, fueled by their history of struggle and revolution, aligns strongly with the ideals of our movement. The military advisors accompanying the supplies, veterans of Cuban campaigns, are equally passionate, offering their expertise to our forces with a clear readiness to engage and eradicate fascism from Iberia permanently. This foreign assistance is not just a boost to our military capabilities but also a reminder of the international solidarity we command. The symbolism of this aid- coming from a nation that has fought imperialism and oppression- cannot be understated. As we distribute these resources and integrate the advisors into our ranks, the fight to erase the stain of Francoism at last gains new momentum, with our soldiers emboldened by the fact that soon a liberated Iberia may be a reality."
cuba.388.d2:0 "In a surprising yet strategic shift, ships bearing the Cuban flag have arrived in our ports, delivering guns, supplies, and military advisors to assist in our ongoing battle against the communist insurgency. The Cuban government, having recently undergone a sharp political realignment following its exile leadership’s consolidation, has emerged as an unprecedented ally in our cause. Despite their advisors appearing somewhat reluctant, their presence on Spanish soil is nonetheless a significant symbol of our shared fight against the Red Menace. The supplies they bring will bolster our capabilities in a conflict that remains at the heart of Spain’s future stability. The Cuban advisors, while not as enthusiastic as their government might suggest, are an indication of the broader international effort to support our government in this critical moment, even if they seemingly have their private reservations about their involvement. With this ironic twist of fate now seemingly bolstering our frontlines, the fact remains that Spain’s global connections remain strong despite King Juan I’s decision to begin isolating our state after the fall of the United States. This assistance, arriving at a pivotal time, offers a critical boost as we intensify our efforts to restore order and push back against the encroaching tide of communism. Victory will arrive, and we may have our former colony to thank for it."

Shipments of military equipment, along with advisors from Havana, have arrived to strengthen our lines and boost our efforts in what is quickly becoming a decisive phase of the conflict. Fueled by their fierce anti-imperialist stance, the Cubans are eager to strike a symbolic and strategic blow against the remnants of the British Empire, aligning themselves firmly with our cause for liberation. This aid could not have arrived at a more opportune time. Our military resources, while steadfast, are far from sufficient for a prolonged engagement with the superior forces of the United Kingdom. The influx of Cuban support- both material and strategic- represents a crucial lifeline, one that may finally allow us to turn the tide in this grueling struggle. For Cuba, this is as much a geopolitical statement as it is an act of solidarity. Having shaken off its own imperialist chains decades ago, the Caribbean nation has long been a vocal advocate for global anti-imperialism, and now they have chosen to stand alongside us in our battle for independence. While victory remains uncertain, the arrival of this aid offers renewed hope, with it being a stark reminder that, despite our size and resources, we are not alone in the fight for self-determination, and anti-imperialism."

While it is a curious turn given Havana’s past leanings- especially their support for Argentina’s claims over the Falklands- there is no denying that their assistance could prove valuable in our campaign. The Cuban advisors, veterans of anti-Communist operations back home, bring with them a wealth of experience in managing insurgencies, which might very well bolster our efforts to restore order. The irony of the situation, with former adversaries now offering aid, has not gone unnoticed. Yet, as Britain faces ongoing challenges with rebel forces, we can only welcome this unexpected show of solidarity. In the end, what matters is the strength of our allies and the reinforcement of our position. With Cuban support now in hand, we have a real chance of tightening the reins of the insurgent movements, bringing them to heel once and for all.

In the face of reunification, with most other nations hesitant to engage in our internal conflict, Cuba’s decision to send arms and personnel carries significant weight. Their expertise- particularly honed in their internal conflict and foreign military engagements - could prove instrumental in reinforcing our capabilities at this critical juncture. While the Cubans may quietly relish the irony of assisting where they once might have opposed, there is little time for reflection on past enmities. Some among our ranks may grumble at the idea of foreign aid, but pragmatism has availed. With reunification within reach and the need for decisive strength paramount, we are already integrating Cuban supplies and advisors into our forces, preparing for the final push. As we move forward, it is clear that foreign alliances, however unexpected, may shape the outcome of this effort to rebuild our nation.

While it would typically seem straightforward for us to support Medinaceli’s government, the situation has become far more complicated than originally intended. Medinaceli’s administration, struggling for survival, has, in a desperate attempt to ensure it is not defeated by the coalition of democrats that have risen against it, forged unsettling and worrying ties with far-right groups, an alliance that goes directly against everything we stand for. At the same time, the Bolivian rebels are not without promise. Among their ranks, the Instrument for the Sovereignty of Peoples has emerged as a key force in the conflict, with their commitment to sovereignty and social justice aligning with our core values, suggesting that, if they seize power, they could prove to be more consistent allies in the long term. As expected, our government is now locked in a fierce internal debate over whether we should back Medinaceli, the devil we know, with his crumbling reactionary alliance, or take a calculated risk with the Bolivarian rebels, whose success is far from guaranteed, but whose politics are undeniably more in tune with our vision for Latin America."

This is not the first time Cuba has intervened in our affairs, as their involvement recalls their support for Che Guevara’s successful insurgency against René Barrientos. This shared revolutionary history between our nation runs deep, and the symbolism of Cuban aid has sparked an immeasurable sense of hope among our ranks. However, while the Cuban government’s commitment is clear, there are murmurs of ambivalence from some of the Cuban advisors on the ground. There are whispers that certain factions within Havana would have preferred to back our opponents in their struggle, seemingly viewing them as potentially more ideologically aligned in the long run. While these rumors have been categorically denied by the Cuban advisors, the rumors have done little to make integration of their forces an easy affair.

As the Cuban-trained soldiers march towards the frontlines, their presence is set to bring renewed strength to our campaign, owing to the sheer discipline and battle-hardened resolve they possess. Beyond their immediate contributions in battle, these revolutionaries also represent the core of what could become a professionalized and robust Bolivian army once the conflict finally ends.

While they share ideological alignment, Cuba has often acted without coordination, involving itself in conflicts across Africa, Latin America, and beyond. Its interventionist tendencies have been a double-edged sword - sometimes advancing our shared goals, but at other times embroiling its allies in costly and controversial engagements.

It is neither practical nor feasible to undertake a complete purge of our command structure at this juncture, which was seemingly what was expected from Canada.

While we have welcomed visitors from various post-American states over the years, the arrival of yanqui holiday makers marks a pivotal moment in our economic revival. Tourists from across the American Republic are flocking to Cuba, invigorating our hospitality sector as they fill our hotels, dine in our restaurants, and explore the myriad of attractions that define our island. This influx of visitors not only provides a much-needed boost to our economy but also represents a renewed sense of connection and shared history. Beyond mere tourism, many of these travelers are seizing the opportunity to reunite with family members long divided by the policies of the Castro regime, these reconnections have been a moving sight for many, with the foreign office now establishing an office dedicated to reuniting families, and helping to uncover the fate of those who were not as lucky to survive the brutality of Castro. As Cuba embraces this new chapter, we remain committed to ensuring that our guests feel welcomed and appreciated. The return of American tourists heralds a promising era for our island, one that we will not squander in our pursuit to forge stronger bonds with our ally across the strait."

cuba.425.d:0 "In a move that has sparked intense debate both domestically and internationally, our lawmakers have reintroduced the Platt Amendment into the Constitution, a decision heavily encouraged by the exile community and backed by the American Republic’s government in Atlanta. The revived amendment, which once granted the United States broad interventionist rights over Cuban affairs, is now poised to reshape the country’s political landscape yet again. The amendments grant the American Republic the unilateral right to intervene in Cuban politics under the guise of preserving the nation’s independence, protecting life, property, and individual liberty, and guiding the country’s foreign policy by signing or rejecting treaties on Cuba’s behalf. Additionally, it has allowed the establishment of American naval bases on Cuban territory for mutual defense. This version, however, maintains Cuban sovereignty over Isla de la Juventud, a slight and reasonable departure from the original amendment. While proponents argue that the reintroduction of the amendment is essential to prevent the resurgence of Castroism and ensure the stability of Cuba, critics have swiftly denounced the move as a sellout of national sovereignty. Mass protests have already erupted across the Republic, with communist elements leading the charge, accusing lawmakers of handing Cuba over to the yanquis and eroding the independence hard won over the last half-century."

The reinstatement of American oversight over Cuban politics and defense represents not only a victory for our nation but a clear signal to the world that the [USA.GetName] remains a dominant force, capable of shaping global affairs as we once did before 1987. By securing the unilateral right to intervene in Cuban political matters and ensuring a strong American naval presence on the island, we have reaffirmed our influence in the Caribbean and beyond. The American people can rest assured that, with our continued presence in Cuba, we have cemented our role as a guardian of liberty and democracy in the Western Hemisphere. This success further demonstrates that America is far from diminished, and we are more than ready to safeguard our interests, restore lost territories to their rightful place, and confront any forces - internal or external - that dare to challenge us."

After years of realignment in a changing world, it now appears that Russia, under the leadership of [RUS.GetLeader] has become a more reliable partner for our Republic than either the remnants of capitalism or the communist hegemon. In response to this realization, our government has now reached out to Moscow, seeking to rekindle the historical ties that once bound us to the Soviet Union. To our satisfaction, Russia has shown considerable interest in rekindling this relationship and after fruitful discussions, has agreed to renew the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation. As part of the agreement, Russia will once again be permitted to station military personnel and equipment on our soil. This renewed treaty not only strengthens our defense capabilities but also solidifies our partnership with one of the world’s most powerful nations, ensuring that we remain well-protected in an increasingly uncertain geopolitical landscape. With Russia’s military presence re-established, we can confidently defend our sovereignty and chart a clear path forward with a nation that understands our shared values of cooperation and mutual respect."

In Santiago de Cuba, during the inauguration of these expanded naval installations, [ROOT.GetLeader] was joined by the Russian ambassador in a symbolic ribbon-cutting ceremony, with the two professing their support of this expansion and the radical changes it will allow Havana and Moscow to bring to the Caribbean. While the event left no doubt about the mutual benefit of this expansion, it is clear that Russia stands to gain the most from these new facilities, owing to our significantly smaller fleet. With a Russian naval garrison expected to arrive within the coming months, our island will soon come under the protection of a flotilla that has not been seen in the Caribbean since 1961. With our longstanding partnership with Russia having weathered many changes in global politics, this latest development is a testament to our shared ideological commitments, to which the naval facilities in Havana and Santiago de Cuba reveal to us and the world that never again will Havana and Moscow break from one another."

Historically known for their maverick policies and reluctance to align fully with the Soviet bloc, the Cuban government is nonetheless a strategic force in the Americas. Although they have been an unpredictable ally under the old order, their geopolitical and political significance remains undeniable, especially in light of our limited reach into the Western Hemisphere. By accepting Cuba into the Moscow Accord, we gain a quick and direct path to challenge the Canadians, while also laying the groundwork to extend our influence across Latin America. Having a foothold so close to North America could prove to be a major strategic advantage. Yet, we must ask ourselves: do we wish to take on the responsibility of aligning with a nation known for its unpredictable swings and stubborn independence? Will their eccentric leadership be a burden, or will they adapt to the demands of our collective goals? If accepted, this move would signal a bold new chapter in our foreign policy, reaffirming our status as a global power capable of influencing affairs in regions historically under Western control."

By joining the Moscow Accord, we not only secure vital military and economic support but also reaffirm our commitment to a multipolar world where Cuba plays a central role in resisting imperialist forces. This renewed partnership places us firmly on the global stage, standing tall with a nation that has proven its resilience in the face of Western adversaries. Together, with Russia and our fellow allies in the Accord, we can project strength and solidarity across Latin America and beyond.

Despite our efforts to rebuild ties with Russia and the expectation that our long-standing historical relationship would pave the way for closer collaboration, Moscow’s decision has left our government blindsided. While we understood there were some ideological and strategic distances between us, the notion that these would prevent such a critical partnership was beyond our expectations. With this rejection, our position on the global stage becomes even more precarious. Alienated from the world’s major powers, Cuba now finds itself increasingly isolated, as attempts to secure a powerful military alliance have fallen through. While Moscow may never publicly admit their reasoning, some have asserted that the government of [RUS.GetLeader] was simply too headstrong to admit a potential ally with an independent streak such as our own, with some theorizing that the Moscow Accords are as centralized as the Warsaw Pact once was before 1986. Without the protection of the Moscow Accord, our government must face the harsh reality of standing alone in a world fraught with geopolitical tensions, with nothing but our own armed forces there to save us from domination by a foreign power."

Recognizing its enduring importance, [ROOT.GetLeader] has summoned the leaders of the NAM to Havana for a historic summit, laying out an ambitious and bold vision for the future of the movement. While the NAM has successfully connected us to allies and partners across the Third World, the Cuban leadership has identified a critical shortcoming: it has not been a sufficient bulwark against the forces of imperialism still wielded by global superpowers. The summit in Havana, therefore, aims to address this weakness by proposing a sweeping new initiative - military collaboration among member states. Under this proposal, Cuba will leverage its significant military expertise, developed through decades of interventionism and resistance, to create a collective training and military partnership with NAM members. Admitting to the slight necessity for the partial militarization of the movement, the hope is that in an ever-increasingly hostile world, the various member states will see the necessity of this action seeing it not as the development of our form of imperialism but the establishment of a united global military aimed at defending all from the threats of the world hegemons."

The plan, framed by the Cuban leadership as a necessary measure to bolster our chances of resisting imperialist advances, calls for shared military training, pooling of combat experience, and joint efforts to strengthen the defense capabilities of all NAM nations. While the proposition appears to be made in good faith, with Cuba presenting it as a means of ensuring that the so-called Third World remains equipped to defend its sovereignty, many within the NAM are approaching the idea with caution. There’s no denying that the movement, historically dedicated to remaining outside of power blocs, has not always been uniformly successful at resisting external pressures, particularly from the world’s superpowers. A military partnership, as proposed, could provide tangible benefits to those nations lacking the experience or resources to build effective defense mechanisms. However, the idea of militarizing the NAM runs counter to the movement’s foundational principles of non-alignment and independence from any military bloc. Some member states are openly concerned that this partnership could gradually shift the NAM away from its original mission and bring it closer to resembling the very power structures it was created to avoid."

The Cuban government, in a show of solidarity, has committed a significant sum of resources to support our development plans, including the dispatch of technical experts, architects, and a wealth of building materials, all aimed at helping us accelerate the pace of national development. With Cuban assistance, we are now positioned to make critical advancements, the construction of new roads, railways, power plants, and other vital infrastructure is set to move forward at a much faster rate than we had previously estimated, and it is all thanks to our close alliance with Havana. Having sent similar aid to other members of the Non-Aligned Movement, the recent debacle surrounding the militarization of the movement has largely faded as it becomes ever clearer that Cuba, despite its recent announcement, is working to continue the delicate balance of the NAM between economic and military cooperation. As we strive to modernize and bring our country into the twenty-first century, the support from Cuba will have a long-lasting impact.

Denouncing all major powers without exception, the Assembly was gifted with a speech that decried all so-called world powers in all corners of the world for indulging in imperial tendencies, explicitly rejecting any spheres of influence. In a rallying cry to fellow NAM nations, [ROOT.GetLeader] urged smaller countries to stand together, to reject domination by the superpowers, and to forge a path of true independence.

One proposal advocates for a more focused approach, suggesting that we build a strong and cohesive vanguard alliance consisting of only our closest and most aligned allies within the movement. This approach promises a more manageable and unified force, ensuring that the pact would be built upon a foundation of ideological and strategic coherence. On the other hand, there is considerable support for an expansive pact that would draw in as many NAM members as possible, extending the reach of the movement's military cooperation across the entire Third World. While a more difficult alliance to manage, it would send a clear message to the world that the Third World is not to be trifled with and that imperialism in the twenty-first century cannot, and will not, be tolerated."

While joining with Cuba would no doubt ensure our protection from the threat of international imperialism, the very essence of the NAM has been its commitment to remaining independent from the pressures exerted by great powers. Accepting Cuba’s proposal could transform the NAM into yet another power bloc akin to the Warsaw Pact or the Democratic League, with such a shift likely to attract the attention of the same imperialists we hope to deter. The decision before us is not merely one of military cooperation; it is a defining moment that could reshape our identity within the international community.

Our efforts to bolster solidarity among member states remain steadfast, and we will continue to pursue partnerships with those who share our vision.

While we may not have achieved universal consensus, our commitment to fostering collaboration and mutual support among our allies remains unwavering, and the recently developed unity among the NAM member states has proven that even in the twenty-first century the people of the so-called Third World and the Global South have a right to determine their future, either as our close military allies or in the status quo that has existed since 1961."

The sea laps against rusting hulls, the gulls cry out over empty docks, and the cranes, those steel giants, hang motionless, their long arms frozen mid-motion, as though caught in the act of surrender. Once, these ports bustled with the feverish energy of commerce, ships from distant lands unloading their cargo, foreign tongues mingling with the sharp calls of dockworkers. Now, the silence is nearly sacred. The gates have long been shut, the customs houses long abandoned, the manifests left unwritten. The enemies of the Revolution could always slip through the cracks, hiding in the shadows of trade, bringing their poisons, their spies, their whispers of treason. No longer. The harbors are not points of entry, but of departure. Departure from the old, from dependency, from the illusion that anything beyond Cuba’s shores is necessary. The economy will suffer, they say. The factories will strain, the storehouses will empty. But what is suffering to a people who have already endured so much? What is hunger to those who have stared down the abyss and lived. The Revolution is not built on trade. It is built on spirit, and spirit does not rot in warehouses or spoil in cargo holds."

The Ghost of the Revolution's Future lingers beside him, its form indistinct, shifting like mist. Together, they watch the scene unfold, the culmination of years of vengeance, of sacrifice. The faces in the crowd blur, not with the heat of devotion, but with the cold stare of history itself. He sees the soldiers, their rifles polished but heavy in their arms. He sees the ministers, their smiles thin. He sees the people, who once followed with hope, and now march with grim resolve. “Is this a victory?” The Comandante asks, but the Ghost does not answer. It does not need to. The Ghost gestures with a skeletal hand, and suddenly, the future unspools before him like a reel unraveling. A land burned clean of enemies but also of friends. A nation secure but suffocating. A leader triumphant, but only in the echoes of silence that follow his words. The Comandante blinks, and the vision is gone. The banners wave. The crowd still roars. His other self still stands at the podium, fists clenched. At the end of it, El Líder Máximo stands much like his nation, though surrounded by millions, isolated and alone, fearing what he might do next. Feared for the power he held at his fingertips, power which by his actions knows no other utility than death."

Despite the cherished status of these landmarks, successive Cuban governments, with their decentralized cultural policies, have left many of these sites underfunded and in disrepair. However, a notable shift is now underway following a significant grant from the European Union’s Creative Europe program. The program, which has aimed to protect and expand on cultural sites and artistic expression, has now granted us access to significant funding aimed at preserving our heritage sites, marking a new chapter in our relations. Already, work is underway across the island to restore the Republic’s iconic architecture and historic districts, with repairs to crumbling buildings, reinforcement of decaying structures, and improved protections for the culturally significant sites all being prioritized thanks to this new funding. Local authorities have hailed the initiative, as it both safeguards the country’s history and signals a growing partnership with Brussels. As the Republic now deepens its diplomatic and economic ties with Europe, the grant stands as a symbol of how cultural cooperation can enhance broader geopolitical and economic relationships."

In light of these unsettling claims, the Syrian cabinet has reportedly advised their President to curtail his visit, prompting a flurry of speculation regarding the security of Havana. While the General Intelligence Directorate has found no substantiating evidence to support these rumors, the situation has raised significant questions. Not only does it provoke concern about the potential threats faced by our esteemed guests and all future guests, but it also leads us to ponder what intelligence may have been available to the Syrian government, who have been less than willing to cooperate in the investigation. With President al-Assad leaving without incident, the visit has been one of great importance and mystery, with it is unlikely that we will ever uncover the truth behind the supposed attempt on al-Assad’s life."

Emphasizing Cuba’s role as a model for other nations in the region, Cruz declared that the nation had become a blueprint for a Christian resurgence in Latin America, arguing that the Republic stood as a testament to what can be achieved when God’s will is placed at the forefront of governance, and when all people’s of a nation love and cherish the Lord. As the summit concluded shortly after, the atmosphere was charged with a sense of purpose and renewed vigor, with the gathering not only solidifying Cuba’s standing as a leader in the evangelical movement but also laying the groundwork for future cooperative efforts as the model espoused by Supreme Leader Cruz spreads across groups in Brazil, Peru, Central America, and other like-minded, God-fearing states."

On the opposite side of the political spectrum, the Mayor of Havana, Marta Hernández Romero, has successfully built a coalition of the left with hardliners and apparatchiks who have criticized Castro Espín for her compromises that have supposedly watered down the legacy and electability of the party, arguing instead for a return to more radical solutions.

One school of thought, championed by veteran party activist Felix Navarro Rodriguez, suggests that the party’s urban-centric focus overlooked the significance of rural voters, a critical demographic given their strong support for the PCC and Castro. Another viewpoint posits that the party’s failure came from its inability to harness anti-communist sentiment, caused by the fact that it fielded a former communist as its candidate, arguing that someone more outspoken about the evils of communist ideology than Roca had been was much needed. While advocates of this line of thought have declared their respect for Roca’s campaigning and bravery for his public denunciation of communism on television, these members have argued that Tania Bruguera would have been a more efficient leader due to her long history of activism and ability to resonate with the broader anti-communist movements across the nation.

While its incumbent leadership is managing to win the argument, elements of the party’s left wing have been able to siphon support away, with veteran intellectual Manuel Cuesta Morua arguing that the loss came from the PSC refusing to advocate for a stronger commitment to its progressive identity and closer alignment with non-communist leftist traditions that would have reaffirmed the party’s social democratic principles. However, this stance has stirred controversy, with a significant fraction of the PSC’s party membership advocating for a shift towards a nationalistic and conservative outlook to appeal to patriotic sentiments among the Cuban populace.

The party’s introspection centers on whether to fortify its liberal platform or align with the Christian majority and embrace a conservative stance to broaden its appeal. Party activist Berta Solar advocates a bolder commitment to liberal principles, positing that the party's previous electoral setbacks stemmed from timidity and a failure to fully embrace its liberal agenda. She proposes that by amplifying its liberal message, the party can resonate with a broader spectrum of voters and distinguish itself from competing political factions. Conversely, a faction within the party, led by Óscar Elías Biscet, advocates for a strategic shift towards courting the Christian majority. Recognizing the significant presence of devout Catholics within the party, Biscet suggests that aligning with Christian values could attract voters disenchanted with the status quo. However, Biscet's proposal to adopt an expressly conservative stance, particularly regarding controversial issues like abortion, raises concerns about alienating segments of the electorate and party members. Amidst these divergent viewpoints, the Cuban Liberal Union faces the challenge of charting a cohesive and compelling electoral strategy.

While Castro Espín and Lage Davila noted that the Cuban people were generally in favor of the democratic reforms, they were in agreement that the party needed to adapt its approach to the new era. As the discussion dragged on for hours on how the party needed to adapt, a plan was slowly formulated by the gathered parties which would ensure the dominance of the PCC for years to come. Dubbed ‘Plan ESCUDO’, it is intended to aid the party in seizing control of the social forces of this nascent liberal democracy, array these social forces so that the Communist Party can be assured that it will always win an election without ever needing to rig the popular systems."

Much to Machado Ventura’s chagrin, however, the rest of the Politburo were in agreement that a plain crackdown on the press was not viable, nor were more subtle means of having MINCOM reject the registration of insufficiently trustworthy press organs. Instead, three options have presented themselves: Covertly supporting those press organs that would largely agree with the broad goals of our policy, even if they’re not directly affiliated with us, such as the recently founded 11YMedio led by non-partisan socialist Yoani Sanchez; or reforming the management of our affiliated press organs such as Granma and Juventud Rebelde to grant them a more independent editorial line while keeping them close still.

Nevertheless, they still retain a great deal of penetration in Cuban society thanks to their close ties with the Communist Party, and, as such, the government sees great potential in them. As such, Mariela Castro Espín has been meeting with the national leadership of the CDRs to discuss reforming their role in Cuban society. Regarding them as an important tool of local democracy, Castro Espín has proposed to remove their responsibility for ‘revolutionary vigilance’ in exchange for transferring more mundane powers onto them, as well as further resources to assist in their local communities. This proposal has, however, received some pushback from the CDR leadership, who are strongly urging the government to restore the informal power they held during the Communist Era by legislation. While they, in their words, ‘could work with’ Castro Espín’s proposal, they insist that it is only with a full suite of responsibilities that they can prevent the organization from becoming entirely irrelevant, which both sides can agree would be detrimental to the Communists’ interests."

With the government largely dismayed at this failure, Carlos Lage Dávila is proposing that we quietly shelve our findings and work to cover up our tracks. The hardliners are less than thrilled with this proposal, arguing that it would mean all our work would go to waste and that this means we merely need to go to further lengths if we are to discredit the opposition.

While the Social Democratic Party has attempted to make it clear that partnerships with fellow democrats are hardly a crime, explaining the millions of Pesos that were passed into their accounts by the Atlanta regime has proven more difficult for the party, the Liberal Union has taken a more apologetic approach and has pledged to return every Peso they were given by the Norteamericanos.

On Jose Ramon Machado Ventura’s demands that these lifelines be cut off to prevent any risks to Plan ESCUDO, Oscar Manuel Silveira Martínez has drafted legislation to begin regulating campaign contributions. As our large membership and the ensuing large amounts of membership fees will insinuate the party against the financial consequences of such legislation, the minister has proposed to ban all donations of sufficient size, along with donations from foreign sources. While this proposal would be broadly popular due to scandals prompted by several large political donations from foreign companies, Machado Ventura believes this proposal to be inadequate, instead arguing that all donations should be banned and all party funding moved to a public funding model.

With even Granma publishing these ratings, worry has begun to spread throughout the Communist Party, with local party sections across the country holding meetings and consultations, debating how to ensure the Communist Party will remain relevant come the 2016 General Election.

Mariela Castro Espín opened the meeting by stating that Plan ESCUDO had failed and that the party had overreached in its attempts to pursue it. As such, unless the party wished to risk terrible backlash and be guaranteed defeat in the next election, the plan must be scuppered, a claim echoed by Carlos Lage Dávila. This proposal was naturally controversial within the executive organ, with the hardliners arguing that Plan ESCUDO was the compromise they agreed to accept that Raúl Castro had lost the country to the liberals, and more moderate voices arguing that the party had already proceeded too far to just halt the plan. Both have agreed that the plan needs to be rethought, either by accelerating it and ensuring that it can succeed while we still have the chance, or by attempting to mollify the concerns that were revealed in the latest polls.

With the opposition unanimously against it, and even some dissenters in the PCC criticizing it for its hasty draft process, criticism was stark, and the government made only a few token efforts to attempt to defend it, stating that it was necessary to ensure stability and prevent sectional interests from reducing the state to non-functionality.

Already, the liberal bloc has proposed a vote of no confidence in the government, appealing to any ‘democratically minded communists’ to break with the party line and bring down the government. Our party whips have assured us that the government’s majority is unassailable, ensuring that the vote will inevitably fail, but this is merely going to be a small victory in this conflict.

It is too late now to rescind the plan, but Carlos Lage Dávila is challenging the notion of whether it is even possible for ESCUDO to succeed at this junction, citing the massive public opposition to the proposal. The biggest counterproposal, however, would be made by Mariela Castro Espín, who has reluctantly proposed to resign, taking responsibility for ESCUDO in the process.

The Communist Party’s polling has still suffered immensely due to this scandal, but the new leadership seems to have stemmed the bleeding.

Despite the criticism from left and right, members of the Communist Party have begun to join the society to ensure that the future of Cuba, in truth, can be one free of discrimination and inequality."

Swiftly catching on with non-communist media, many younger black activists have organized protests around the country, calling on the Cuban government to take greater steps to rectify the legacy of racial discrimination and denouncing Fidel and Raúl as racist leaders no better than their pre-revolutionary predecessors. While some Communist Party activists have attempted to organize counter-protests, increased attention has been brought to the racial record of the government, and though spokespeople of the PCC attempt to emphasize the positive changes that happened under Fidel and Raúl, this issue is one we would rather be without."

With doctors confirming that Bonne had passed away from a heart attack, the President was quick to address the nation, giving a televised speech reflecting on the sorrowful death of his old friend and comrade, looking visibly distraught, as he reflected on the long path the two have travelled together throughout all these years, both in their political and personal lives, before giving his condolences to the minister’s family. As a statesman of the Republic of Cuba, Félix Bonne will be granted a state funeral with full honors. While the nation grieves this loss, politics must continue, and the President has already reached out to Luis Enrique Ferrer García, Social Democratic spokesman on foreign affairs, requesting he will take the role of Foreign Minister, a request he gracefully accepted."

However, contrary to his expectations, the President has been met with more traumatic stories than was hoped by the cabinet. What began as an earnest attempt to bridge the gap between the government and the rural population has quickly descended into a shocking revelation of failed government policy, as the campesinos, many of whom had suffered immensely during the military’s campaign against the communists, did not shy away from confronting the President with the brutal realities of the violence they endured. Speaking candidly about the army’s harsh methods - summary executions, forced relocations, and the destruction of entire villages in the name of restoring order - the resentment in their voices was palpable, and their disdain for the man who had signed off on these orders evident. Frozen in horror as the stories continued to be told to him, the President was filled with self-doubt, believing he had always acted in the best interests of the country, before coming to and overhearing a woman remind him that every death warrant bore his signature and that every innocent death stained his hands. Despite this hatred and initial shock from the President, Batista did make a genuine effort to connect with the farmers, attempting to bridge the chasm of mistrust that had formed. While unsuccessful in his efforts, the President has now returned to the capital, a changed man, burdened by the knowledge that the struggle against communism had come at a far greater cost of life than he had ever imagined."

This omission was not accidental. The Council members are keenly aware that Batista is, in many ways, different from them. His leadership, marked by a blend of idealism and naiveté, often places him at odds with the more pragmatic, and, arguably, self-serving interests of the Council. Continuing to deliberate on the matter of the rewards for their hard work, the debate suddenly and abruptly derailed to the omission of Batista, with Maria Elvira Salazar suddenly realizing the potential benefits of having the President on their side, or at least more aligned with their interests. The question, however, is how to approach the matter. If the President is brought into the fold, should he then be offered a share of the financial benefits that grease the wheels of governance? While tempting, such an introduction to these exclusive meetings could backfire, exposing the near total control of the Council over the Republic, not to mention raising ugly questions about the source of this money, which would risk all hopes of a fruitful working relationship with him."

The President’s concerns are not, however, without merit. The return of the latifundias does threaten to reignite the deep-seated inequalities that fueled discontent in the first place. His unease is palpable, and the fact he has come to the Council to present these concerns reveals that he has begun to question whether their course of action is ultimately for the benefit of the nation. To ensure that the President remains loyal, and does not continue to question the necessary reforms needed to bring about the end of the communist menace, it has been suggested that the Council take action immediately, attempting to assuage Batista’s fears, utilizing the argument that the anger has been overblown and caused by the farmers sudden adjustment to their new situation. However, it has also been suggested that the President can easily be calmed through the promise of token reform, which will appease the farmers, ending their protests, and ensuring the President doesn’t question our commitment to reform again."

Santiago, once a bastion of Castroite resistance before the island’s liberation, now finds its streets teeming with protesters vehemently opposing the reinterment of the former President. The demonstrators, many of whom still view President Batista as a symbol of tyranny and oppression, have taken to the streets to accuse him of being a fascist murderer, unworthy of resting among Cuba’s most esteemed heroes. With riots breaking out across the city, government buildings have become targets of vandalism and violence, and the fury of the population, fueled by a deep-seated resentment of Batista’s legacy, threatens to destabilize the region. Put briefly: the backlash has been swift and widespread. For the Liberty Council, however, there is no question of backing down, the reburial of Batista must be upheld to affirm their narrative of the nation’s past and destroy the Castroite menace once and for all. Already, permission has been granted for the authorities to initiate firm countermeasures to restore order, with a heavy military presence in the streets expected, with crackdowns soon to follow.

With the order given to the Constitutional Cuban Army to begin to break apart any gatherings and protests should they not heed their demands to disperse, President Batista sits alone in the Presidential Palace, rereading the orders being given to save the nation, in silence, contemplating everything that is occurring. With the operation being executed with a heavy hand, soldiers have come cracking down with brutal efficiency, the cries of outrage that echoed the streets now replaced by the thunder of marching boots.

While murmurs of a partisan rising echo across the various towns and villages of the nation, such efforts will be met with the same strength and violence should they ever try to cross the government's path. With the Liberty Council enthusiastic about the results, celebrating the efforts of the armed forces, President Batista has been less than thrilled. Despite being pleased with the defeat of the resistance efforts, Batista has exhibited an unusual degree of shock and confusion, with his aides reporting he has begun to privately question his advisors, expressing disbelief that after decades of Castroist rule and its associated brutality, the Cuban people could still harbor such deep-seated animosity toward his father. This apparent softening in Batista’s stance has raised eyebrows within the Liberty Council, with there now a growing unease among its members who feel the President may soon begin to ask questions should his resolve not recover.

The depth of the public’s anger has forced him to confront the possibility that the Castroist propaganda, which for years painted his father as a tyrant, truly took root within the Cuban populace?

Speaking clearly, and with clear authority, he announced that he had finally seen through their deception, realizing that they had taken him for a fool. Calling out each minister for their roles in manipulating his presidency and steering the country down a path that contradicted his vision for Cuba, it did not take long for the traitors to attempt to placate the President, insisting that he was misinformed and that there had been no such conspiracy. But as they observed his unwavering stance, and the determination in his eyes, it quickly became clear that Batista was fully aware of all that had taken place. At his signal, a contingent of his loyal paramilitary force stormed the meeting room, swiftly detaining the ministers, as they cried out to be released, pinning the blame on each other. While Batista’s move has successfully neutralized the immediate threat posed by his disloyal ministers, the repercussions will be far-reaching.

Faced with the urgent need to stabilize the government while simultaneously securing his authority, Batista has made a calculated move by reaching out to an unexpected ally: the Christian Democratic Party. Historically a smaller but influential political force, the PDC has long been associated with the Cuban exile community, particularly its more liberal segments. Their platform, which blends social conservatism with a commitment to social justice, presents a palatable alternative to the ideological extremes that have characterized the country’s recent political landscape. For the President, the PDC represents an ideal compromise- one that allows him to introduce a new political dynamic without upending the existing order he unwittingly created entirely. Keen to expand their influence, the PDC eagerly accepted Batista’s invitation to join the transitional government, bringing with them a network of connections within the exile community and a reputation for advocating for policies that resonate with the broader Cuban populace. However, despite this invitation, the remnants of the PAP, particularly those factions that feel betrayed by Batista’s recent actions, are not going quietly, launching a concerted effort to undermine the rogue President, leveraging their remaining influence to impede his initiatives and rally support against him."

The setting was tense as Batista, flanked by his loyal militia, delivered a stark message to the mobsters who have long used Cuba as a haven for their illicit operations, stating simply that they had one week to get the hell out of Cuba, or he would track them down and prosecute every last one of them. This was no empty threat as, over the years, Batista had quietly amassed a substantial amount of evidence, privately investigating those who came to visit when his cabinet assured him they were not a cause for concern, resulting in an intricate paper trail of the mafia’s dealings in Cuba, now ready to use this weapon against the mafia. Informed that before their departure, they would be expected to hand over all details of their operations in Cuba, these men were then met with a barricade of Batista’s militia who promised they would be released once they had complied with the President’s demands and had a quiet chat in another room.

However, despite the President’s enthusiasm, many within the exile community, and even within the government, have expressed concerns about the long-term implications of this amnesty, fearing that the communists, who have not forgotten the harsh treatment they received up until now, might use this newfound freedom to regroup and seek revenge.

Attempting to distance himself from the crimes of his predecessors, and his father, Batista reiterated his commitment to democratic principles and assured Machado, Cienfuegos, and all others present that he is not beholden to the past authoritarian practices of his peers. Despite the challenging nature of the discussions, the fact that they have taken place at all proves to be a significant step forward for the Republic, with it likely that if such talks continue and the President remains committed to his reforms, the divide created so long ago on the night of July 26th may finally mend."

Such an assertive and combative stance has resonated well with the militants and supporters who suffered at the hands of the exiles, however, has failed to sway moderate voters who remain wary of a return to more radical policies. In contrast, having searched far and wide within the party, Manuel Cuesta Morua of the PAP promises to build on the reforms initiated by Roberto Batista while also seeking to turn a new page in Cuban democracy. Emphasizing continuity with a focus on furthering social democracy without the baggage of past conflicts, Morua has sought to appeal to as wide a voter base as possible, even though this has done little to bring enthusiasm to his campaign despite the support of President Batista.

cuba.518.d:0 "In a truly unexpected development, the Cuban government has abruptly called off its military mobilization. According to our intelligence, Cuban forces were nearing peak readiness, with a predicted assault window of just seventy-two hours. Then, seemingly without explanation, everything ground to a halt. Troops have now returned to their barracks, and the heightened alert status has been quickly rescinded. Despite intense intelligence gathering, what drove President Castro to such a decision remains a mystery, with only God knowing what might have changed his mind at the last minute. While many within the CIA have suggested this sudden cancellation has been done purposefully to throw our intelligence off guard, there seems to be little reason to believe this is the case as again, there has seemingly been a total cessation of all military activity on the island. For now, it seems we have been granted reprieve from Fidel’s wrath. However, this turn of events will require careful recalibration of our posture toward Havana, with additional task forces now being sent off the coast of Florida to continue to observe Cuban naval and aerial exercises. While the resumption of such a vast mobilization is unlikely, all we can do is wait and hope that Operation Mongoose is successful within the coming months."

The public sentiments over the war in Namibia have been clear from the beginning, with widespread sympathies for the Namibian cause. With many Cubans having served as conscripts in the wars against the Apartheid regime in Angola, as well as the brunt of our officer corps serving their formative years during that decade-long conflict, the recent change in policy means that there's now appetite for more. On behalf of an investigatory committee set down by the Minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces, High Command has proposed that we join the fray and assist the Namibians' independent aspirations fully, putting the full brunt of the Cuban Army towards the liberation of the Namibian people, hoping to inflict the decisive hit to the Apartheid regime. Our power projection into the conflict is however limited, owing to the distances involved, and it would remind many of our allies of our tensions with Moscow during the war in Angola. Any move we make has to be careful, and well considered."

While not as extensive as some had speculated, this proposal would nevertheless bind us all much closer together within the NAM. Though the Cuban proposal is well-intentioned for sure, and the mutual assistance wouldn't be amiss, it is still quite extensive, and puts some constraints on our international maneuvering room, prompting hesitation among the foreign service, and discussions in the hall of power. With Cuba quite intent on moving ahead with this, we are expected to give a response to them sooner, rather than later."

cuba_news.2.d:0 "Following weeks of fierce debate in Cuban constitutional discussion forums, the results of the public consultation period into the recently drafted 2010 Constitution have now concluded, revealing that, despite a surprisingly well-run campaign by a resurgent liberal opposition, the Cuban people have chosen to overwhelmingly endorse the constitution nearly as proposed by President Raúl Castro at the start of the consultation period. With the reforms requested being implemented into the constitution, which amounts to little more than the strengthening of civil liberties, and reforming state institutions, the hopes of a generation have now been defeated as the monopoly of power held by the Communist Party since 1953 continues to be the guiding force of Cuba’s future, despite having lost a sense of legitimacy following the continuing terrorist attacks across the Republic and a continued campaign by liberal activists for a more democratic constitution. Despite President Castro’s attempts to alleviate these concerns, claiming that the 2010 Constitution will be a unifying document for a Republic calling out for reform, the defeated liberal opposition have continued to denounce the results, announcing their intention to boycott the upcoming March elections, rallying around its unofficial leader Vladimiro Roca for answers and a course of action."

The results of the consultation period have reportedly sent a shockwave throughout the highest echelons of the Cuban government, with the National Assembly of People’s Power only tepidly approving the popular amendments, with a not-insignificant number of deputies requesting that President Castro ignore the results to avoid the collapse of Communist Party rule during an ongoing crisis. However, despite these pleas, restated  by Vice President Jose Ramon Machado Ventura, President Castro ultimately decided to support the amendments, fearing the risk of further protests and riots from the already triumphant opposition. With it clear that the days of the Communist Party’s dominance are over and an internal power struggle brewing, the Pearl of the Antilles begins the long process of democratization, with the upcoming general elections serving as the ultimate test for the Communist Party."

However, although the Communist Party has seemingly embraced the new political structure it finds itself in, it has seemingly refused to let go of its past, electing the daughter of Raúl Castro, Mariela Castro Espín as both president and general secretary, demonstrating that even now, after significant reform, the Castro lineage dominates the political landscape of the Republic. On the surface, it appears as though very little has changed for the island nation, however, while President Espín may have promised to continue her father’s work, the Communist Party has been fundamentally altered by their electoral success with the sudden influx of new membership, and the comparatively liberal positions of Castro Espín, demonstrating that Cuban socialism is, at the least, altered. Yet, with the Communist Party’s old guard retaining their positions of power, only time will tell whether the reformist hand that currently guides the Pearl of the Antilles shall maintain its steady grip over the nation, or if specters of the past shall come back to haunt the niece of Fidel Castro."

Once a respected member of the Communist Party, Vladimiro Roca suddenly became the voice of the democratic opposition following his shock denouncement of Communist rule on national television, calling for the people to use the opportunity of the public consultation period to express their desire for democratic reforms. Despite slander and an intense campaign of fearmongering by the Communist Party, who had hoped to utilize Roca’s capitalist flirtations against him, the age of the ruby red flag has come to a close in Cuba, replaced by a stalwartly reformist regime. Now allowed to write the future of Cuba, President Roca has pledged to begin a rapid and dramatic transformation of his nation, hoping to maintain the march of democracy and safeguard the young system from danger. With liberal democracy getting entrenched in Cuba, only time will tell whether its new system will fulfill the people’s expectations, or if regret will make them once more yearn for the days of Castro."

As the unlikeliest of candidates to have achieved a majority within the National Assembly, let alone without a coalition partner, Guedes's victory has been nothing short of a categorical disaster for the Communist Party, which had hoped that the Liberal Union would achieve no more than a few seats. Yet despite consistent agitation against him and his movement, denouncing them as capitalist pawns bent on the destruction of the gains of the Cuban revolution, President Guedes has now overcome his adversities, free to shape Cuba to his liking. Promising an immediate end to the ‘disaster’ that is communism and economic planning, Guedes’s rise to power has been one born from the belief that change, if enacted, must be radical. With there seemingly no room for immediate compromise with the new President’s plans for Cuba, it remains uncertain whether or not his newfound popularity shall remain intact, or if his radical platform will spell an end to the rebirth of Cuban liberalism."

As the result of decades of oppression by the Communist Party, the resurgence of the Christian center has represented a significant reversal of the Cuban political system, with Payá now standing at the head of a divided nation still grappling with the freedoms it has acquired. Seeking to establish a Cuban Republic where all, regardless of their background and ideology, are welcomed, Payá seemingly seeks to follow the example of Christ and reconcile with the supporters of the old regime. While these plans were initially met with skepticism, with some believing retribution against the Communist Party was imminent, inroads have already been made with all parties within the National Assembly to help facilitate a clean transition of power, signaling that Payá’s leadership may indeed be as moderate as purported. Yet, despite his intentions, there remain significant divides between the new President and the people, with President Payá eager to prove he is more than a Christian Democrat and can be the uniting figure he pledged to be."

Sworn in before the National Assembly of People’s Power, having managed to secure the nomination, President Díaz-Canel now stands as the first President of Cuba to not bear the name of Castro. However, despite this defining moment in Cuban history, it appears as though Díaz-Canel’s tenure will not mark the birth of a new revolution in Cuba, with the President having already promised to continue the reforms initiated by his predecessor. Despite positioning himself firmly as a continuity candidate, Díaz-Canel is nevertheless a noted advocate of socially progressive causes, and has promised to continue to work with sexual minorities and other marginalized community groups, opening the door for further reforms. As the Pearl of the Antilles hands the reins of its revolution over to a younger generation, the world watches on, asking the only question on everyone's minds from Havana to Tokyo."

Having courted the hardliners within the Communist Party of Cuba, who still held lingering resentment toward Vice President Díaz-Canel for his alleged desire to reduce the influence of the Revolutionary Armed Forces further, it has become clear that the new President, despite promising to maintain his father’s reforms has found himself, whether intentional or not, in the same binds that once tied his father. Having pledged to be a voice of the people and continue the legacy of his uncle and father before him, it seems as if the Pearl of the Antilles has once again alluded to the possibility of genuine reform, with the PCC seeing it fit to continue its tried and tested policies into the new millennium once more avoiding the people calling out for legitimate action on reform."

Sworn in before the National Assembly of People’s Power following a unanimous vote, President López Miera now stands as the first President of Cuba since the revolution to not bear the name of Castro. Having run unopposed, Miera now leads the Communist Party with a similar iron grip once held by Fidel Castro, free to shape the future of the Cuban revolution to his liking. Already promising a much more conservative approach to his leadership, the new President has done away with the hopes of reform, promising no further gambles with the Communist Party’s guaranteed leadership. While this soft denunciation of Castro has done little to sway moderates within the PCC to his side, who had attempted to stand Colonel Jesús Manuel Burón Tabit of the Ministry of the Interior to avoid an uncontested election, Miera has begun his tenure as he means to continue it through the gradual revival of Cuba’s twentieth-century politics. With the Chief of the General Staff now looking to further the outgoing government’s economic reforms, it seems as though the Pearl of the Antilles will see no additional political reforms."

Having only declared his candidacy a few days before the vote, the former Deputy Minister of the Interior was courted by moderates within the Assembly who hoped to avoid handing the frontrunner, Álvaro López Miera, the presidency on a silver platter. With his election avoiding returning power to the party’s hardliners, Colonel Tabit now stands at a junction he had never anticipated to arrive at. While it is not expected that the President will seek to radically alter from the course that his predecessor had begun for Cuba, the election of Tabit will certainly be a far more moderate alternative than the one proposed by Miera. As Cuba now looks to the future under Tabit, it remains to be seen whether the new President will be able to consolidate his position and leave a lasting legacy beyond being a protest vote."

With the armed forces mobilized in an attempt to find the plane and the President, any hopes of rescuing survivors were quickly ended as pieces of the plane were found washed up across the shore. Having located the fuselage, which had drifted thirteen miles north into the Caribbean Sea, forensics have confirmed that the plane had been downed by a powerful explosive device detonated from inside of the aircraft, confirming that the individuals responsible had somehow gained access to the plane before its departure. With the Politburo now stepping in to oversee the survival of the Cuban government until a successor can be determined, the failures of the General Intelligence Directory have been put on display for the world to see.

Infuriated at the failings of the General Intelligence Directory, Castro has now reported to be involving himself directly in the affairs of all branches of government, supposedly preparing his nation for what can only be expected to be a final conflict against capitalism and the American Republic. With demand for vengeance as high as ever, this rhetoric has been received warmly by the Cuban people as its citizens now take to the streets to rally in support of Fidel’s declaration. With the Republic of Cuba alight with the same fury that burns within the heart of its President, the eyes of the world are now locked onto Havana to see how far a grieving man will go to avenge the death of his comrade-in-arms, his friend, and more importantly, his brother."

Although the initial Florida Straits Crisis left quite a stain on Castro’s international reputation, his radical domestic policies have been deemed a stellar success, which has only cemented his already long-lasting legacy in the eyes of the Cuban people. His more surprising moves towards democratization were also not left unnoticed, as even many liberal activists have publicly paid their respects to Fidel Castro despite the ideological differences, noting that they appreciated his commitment to guiding Cuba into a new era and his wish to prevent a personality cult after his death. While Vice President Lage Dávila will provisionally take up leadership of the country, it is expected that the National Assembly will convene to elect a successor once the state funeral has concluded, having granted the people their chance to say their final farewells to Fidel Alejandro Castro Ruz."

The first term for the democratically-elected PCC was received as a stellar success by most Cubans, which combined with their surprisingly successful campaign of voter mobilization to result in today’s landslide victory. The strongest opponent to Communist reelection was the Social Democratic Party, which took a sharp turn to social conservatism in response to president Castro Espín’s radical progressive reforms, hoping to rally the people against the ever-dominant threat of unfettered and unchecked socialism. Despite gaining significant momentum initially, the election results have now confirmed their efforts were for naught, as the Social Democratic Party did not manage to even achieve twenty percent of the vote. As a result of such a disastrous result for the opposition, 2016 has marked itself as a year of total triumph for the Cuban Revolution, brought into the new Cuban democratic age through two consecutive electoral victories.

With Social Democratic supporters taking to the streets to celebrate this historic moment, Mariela Castro and the Communist Party are reportedly questioning how such an outcome was possible, forced to accept the reality perhaps in their pursuit for social progress, the party lost the support of its traditional base, with large parts of the working class jumping ship to a conservative alternative. With Social Democratic leader José Daniel Ferrer García preparing to form a government, ready to reform the island Republic, the hope instilled into the hearts of many since the consultation period of the 2011 Constitution has never been higher. However, despite this hope, should Ferrer Garcia fail to live up to his promises over the next five years, or if his reforms become perceived as a weaker alternative to what was provided under communism, it is entirely likely that the incoming administration shall only survive a single term."

With that, President Guedes has given his victorious speech to an ecstatic crowd of young supporters, thanking them for their trust and promising to keep reforming Cuba and to further speed up the pace of its economic growth. As the leftist opposition gears up in preparation for another attempt in 2021, Liberals stand triumphant again, once and for all proving the myth of socialist dominance in Cuban society false."

As it seems, despite the largely successful tenure of president Antonio Guedes, which saw Cuba overcome the ‘beast of planned economy’ and transition to free market capitalism, the chaos and division he sowed between pro- and anti-privatization groups was enough to push the majority of Cubans onto the Christian Liberation Movement’s side. As the inauguration of a new president-elect is to be underway soon, Guedes himself gave a speech conceding the electoral defeat and expressing his hope in Christian Liberation’s will to ‘uphold the economic progress and continue the societal reconciliation’. With that, Havana’s newly-formed government already promises to guide the nation past the era of polarization and division and to help Cuba soon become a moral example not only for the Caribbean or Americas, but for the entire globe."

With that, as Guedes concedes the defeat on demands that the PCC’s return will not end Cuban democracy and the achievements of free market, the inauguration is soon to be underway for the new president-elect, who immediately promises a swift reversal of ‘reckless liberal economic reforms’ and an enactment of justice for those who suffered from them. Even though Communists’ historic defeat back in 2011 seems to have humbled the party enough for them to not hint at a crackdown on democratic institutions, there still are fears that Cuba will soon return to the days of Castros’ dictatorship - to the joy of some and the dread of the others."

As such, Cuba enters the small group of countries which practice free market liberalism while essentially being a dictatorship - at least for as long as foreign investors are not turned off by the authoritarian measures taken by the government."

Despite the efforts of the opposition from the Communist Party to the Cuban Liberal Union, each having attempted to secure the support of the public, it appears as though the Liberation Movement’s emphasis on reconciling the Cuban people under the banner of democracy has been more than successful. With the President eager to continue his expansion of the liberties and freedoms that were long denied to the Cuban people, it seems as though the next five years from Cuba will remain largely the same. However, while many have celebrated and accepted this new type of politics from Havana, questions are continuing to be raised as to whether the Christian Liberation Movement can maintain its popularity, while moderation and unity have been at the forefront of Cuban politics since its democratic reform, Payá may have to face the fact that the people will eventually wish for more than reconciliation."

Despite concerns spreading throughout the Cuban right over the return of the PCC, the incoming Communist Party has, in a rare moment of bipartisanship, accepted the successes of the outgoing administration in uniting the country, pledging to maintain the protections passed by Payá during his tenure. However, while this pledge has eased tensions, there has been a palpable sense of unease for the future of the Cuban economy with President-elect [CUB.GetLeader] promising the total reversal of Payá’s economic policies.

Pledging to continue Payá’s social policies, condoning his support for the Church and his reforms to restore the position of Christianity in the country, it seems as though the Social Democrats and President-elect [CUB.GetLeader] are more than prepared for government, having reconciled with their loss in 2011 and emerged stronger than ever, ready to usher in their rose revolution."

Living most of his life in Spain and having witnessed the revolutionary changes imposed by Fidel Castro, President Batista accepted the position despite reportedly holding few political ambitions, but he nevertheless earnestly extended his wishes to reform the Cuban government and build a stable social democracy, honouring his father’s allegedly progressive legacy.

With the island nation beginning to heal and demonstrating that even the fiercest of hostilities can be resolved through diplomacy and compassion for one's fellow man, President Menendez has pledged to continue his work into his second term, delivering in his inaugural address a promise that the term exile shall become obsolete over the next few years.

However, while Sires and the Social Party have openly declared their support for the acceleration of capitalism, fears that the incoming President would do away with significant social and political reforms implemented by his predecessor have quickly been relieved with Sires declaring his chief goal to be the liberation of his people’s wallets.

As a result, the failed successor to former President Hernandez has returned to enact the promises he set out years ago. However, despite President-elect Reich’s fierce rhetoric, the incoming government will find it difficult to introduce legislation that will rescind or undo much of Menendez’s progressive legislation as, already, claims of electoral fraud and intimidation have been lambasted against the incoming government by the final embers of the Cuban socialist movement who have refused to believe that Reich could have won the election legitimately."

The sudden establishment of the Cuban Labor Party in the wake of the nation’s first strikes under exile rule quickly shattered belief that the young democracy would be dominated by exile forces, as hundreds of thousands quickly rallied around the supposed and unofficial successor to the Communist Party.

As the two camps of communists continue to bicker over who is responsible for the loss of a people’s majority, the incoming Social Democrats have promised to restore sense and sensibility to the office of the presidency and the National Assembly, proudly proclaiming that their vision for Cuban socialism is a united one, with the people and party guided by the vision of democracy that should have become a reality in 2011."

While such mobilization was dismissed as the continuation of martial law, the recent rhetoric of Havana has now indicated that the Republic is preparing for the instigation of hostilities with the [USA.GetName]. Given that Castro had recently promised to rain down fire and fury on those responsible for the assassination of his brother, it appears war between Atlanta and Havana is on the horizon. In response to Cuba’s fierce mobilization, the [USA.GetName] responded in force, ordering the general mobilization of its armed forces, and sending patrol vessels into the Florida Straits where they encountered the Revolutionary Navy. While no orders have been relayed yet, with the two navies engaging in the continuation of the decades-long staring contest between Atlanta and Havana, unlike in 1962, there is very little to stop Cuba from turning the crisis into an open conflict with their ideological foe. With the world now waiting to see whether the Florida Straits Crisis will become an open conflict, there is hope that either side will see reason and end such needless saber rattling."

While such an announcement was initially perceived to be a feint by the [USA.GetName], who have maintained their mobilization for the time being, it appears the order is genuine with the Straits now laying still. What prompted Castro to end his retaliation against his age-old enemy is unknown, with speculation now abounding across the international community, however, regardless of why, the decision has been celebrated by millions who feared the potential fallout of an open war between the [USA.GetName] and the Republic of Cuba. As the United Nations celebrates the peaceful end of the crisis, the American Republic has heralded the demobilization as a tremendous success with [USA.GetLeader] declaring that for a second time, Cuba has been defeated. With Castro facing minor backlash from those who believed in the final confrontation with the remnants of America, it seems as though the impact of the Florida Straits Crisis is not as short-lived as many had perceived, with some believing this crisis marks the beginning of a new Cold War."

This is what the Democratic League and much of the United Nations have called Castro’s actions, as even now hundreds more rockets descend upon the last standing cities across the American South. Revolutionary. Even now, as millions have been vaporized in the blinding flash that occurred at precisely 2:19 PM, that is the title bestowed upon Fidel Castro by millions across the world who have celebrated the end of the [USA.GetName] and the death knell of capitalism.

While the return of the exiles had extinguished the hopes of many both within Cuba and across the globe that communism would ever again be able to find a political footing in whatever system of politics the presumed fascistic exiles would impose, President Batista enacted an immediate pardon for all communist partisans, and legalized its political wing, following a protracted power struggle within his government. While such measures had presumably secured the election for the Progressive Action Party, it has become evident that the Communist Party retains its strong hold over the hearts and minds of the Cuban people. Although President-elect Ana Machado calls for restitution for the crimes committed during the exile invasion of Cuba, she has nevertheless pledged to uphold the new democratic framework, setting the stage for a decisive next step in Cuban democracy."

Successfully utilizing their credibility as the founders of modern Cuban democracy, combined with the significant success of the Batista administration in combating corruption at the highest echelons of society, the election of Manuel Morua as Batista’s successor has hardly come as a shock to anyone paying attention to Cuban politics. With a broad base of voters from across the Republic, the successful reelection of the Progressive Action Party has confirmed that, even in Batista’s absence, social democracy has cemented itself as a force to be reckoned with in Cuba, with many believing that if Morua’s tenure is as successful as his predecessor’s, the party will come to rival the influence of the once-dominant Communist Party.

However, as a seeming rejection of Batista, perhaps due to his role in the authoritarian regime that was initially established in his name, the people of Cuba have turned to President-elect Sainz to revitalize the spirit of liberty, missing since 1898. Promising an end to the remnants of authoritarianism that his predecessor seemed unwilling to let go of, President-elect Sainz and his Liberal Union, despite the supposed impossibility of their current circumstances, now embark on an ambitious campaign to secure the rights and liberties of all Cuban people, continuing the legacy of Batista in their own, individualistic, way."

CUB_send_advisors_to_yemen_desc:0 "Despite being provided with all the aid the American Republic could muster, Al-Islah has failed to secure control over Yemen, with the former socialist government mounting a comeback amid a revolt led by General Saleh of the republican guard and the loss of Aden to the liberal Jasmine Council. With the nation thrown into turmoil, there is an opening to spread our influence in the region, putting our finger on the scale, with our experiences from Angola being useful in Yemen just as well."
CUB_return_to_africa:0 "Return to Africa"
CUB_return_to_africa_desc:0 "The continent where most of the fighting under the old policy of Military Interventionism took place, Africa has been characterized by continuous fighting ever since decolonization during the 60s. With the new century unfortunately showing no signs of peace coming to the continent, it is all the more paramount that Cuban troops help bring that peace to the continent."

CUB_send_troops_to_namibian_war_of_independence_desc:0 "Long under the thumb of Johannesburg, Namibia has seen constant conflict against the Marxist SWAPO rebels for decades, but despite the attempts by South Africa they have largely failed to defeat them. With war having flared up between the Namibians and South Africans, we stand in a good position to influence the outcome of the war."
CUB_assist_post_apartheid_south_africa:0 "Assist Post-Apartheid South Africa"
CUB_assist_post_apartheid_south_africa_desc:0 "With our intervention in Namibia having succeeded beyond our expectations, toppling the Apartheid Regime entirely, it is time to cement our ties with the new majority government. Considering their general isolation, Cuba can help sponsor their reentry into the world community, cementing our new partnership and turning our once-enemy into one of our closest allies in the new world."
CUB_reevaluate_our_international_nonalignment:0 "Reevaluate our International Non-Alignment"
CUB_reevaluate_our_international_nonalignment_desc:0 "The recent upheavals and political developments have exposed critical flaws in the current course of Cuban foreign policy. With the storm now over and peace restored to Havana, a revision of our doctrine has become an unavoidable necessity to find a place on the shifting tides of world politics."
CUB_establish_ties_with_eu:0 "Establish Ties with the EU"
CUB_establish_ties_with_eu_desc:0 "Despite having diversified our trade partnerships ever since the end of the Yanqui Blockade, our ties with Europe have remained tenuous and linked through Moscow. To secure our ties with the Socialist bloc, it would be wise to reach out and establish more direct relations with the European Union in order to assert our place in the world and preserve our trade relations."
CUB_preserve_our_common_cultural_heritage:0 "Preserve our Common Cultural Heritage"
CUB_preserve_our_common_cultural_heritage_desc:0 "Owing to our past under the Spanish yoke, Cuba and Europe have long shared cultural and architectural links, but our cultural heritage has long been neglected, leaving many of the old landmarks far from being in the best shape. With additional funding from Europe, this could be reversed and the safety of Cuba's historical patrimony will be secured for generations to come."
CUB_reaffirm_sugar_trade_deals:0 "Reaffirm Sugar Trade Deals"
CUB_reaffirm_sugar_trade_deals_desc:0 "Cuban sugar has been the main source of sucrose in the Soviet sphere ever since the days of the revolution, the above-market prices paid by the Soviets being crucial to Cuban development. Reaffirming this bargain will both assure our partners in Europe of our continued reliability and keep our coffers full, ensuring that the trade keeps flowing from Havana to the European Union."
CUB_join_the_warsaw_pact:0 "Join the Warsaw Pact"
CUB_join_the_warsaw_pact_desc:0 "With tensions rising in the world and the fragments of the United States of America starting to stir, the need to secure the revolution in the Caribbean has become all too critical. To ensure protection against the rising threats, a formal application to the Warsaw Pact must be sent, so that we may stand side by side with our revolutionary comrades."

CUB_deepen_historic_relations_with_Canada_desc:0 "Since the establishment of diplomatic ties in 1942, Cuba and Canada have enjoyed a mutually beneficial relationship, even through of the revolution, thanks to Prime Minister Diefenbaker's decision not to suspend relations. In the time since, they have continued to be a reliable trade partner, if only for pragmatic reasons. These ties should not just remain economical, it is high time to deepen relations and forge a closer connection with Ottawa."
CUB_build_ties_with_democratic_league_militaries:0 "Build Ties with Democratic League Militaries"
CUB_build_ties_with_democratic_league_militaries_desc:0 "With the recent democratization of the Cuban state and our change in alignment, we have found the Canadians and their allies much more willing to cooperate with us. Joining joint military exercises will provide the alliance with our ample experience in military operations courtesy of the old internationalist policy, while we in turn have much to learn from the old NATO doctrines and the Western approach to warfare."
CUB_support_caribbean_democracies:0 "Support Caribbean Democracies"
CUB_support_caribbean_democracies_desc:0 "As we shore up our democratic credentials abroad, the needs of the Caribbean peoples have become apparent.

CUB_enter_the_democratic_league:0 "Enter the Democratic League"
CUB_enter_the_democratic_league_desc:0 "Now the sole leader of the free world, Canada has worked tirelessly to preserve a pilot light of freedom in a world that has fallen to tyranny. It is time to join the fight and light the beacon of democracy once more. In the New World as well as the Old, Cuba will march with the free world once more to protect ourselves and our allies."
CUB_strengthen_the_nonaligned_movement:0 "Strengthen the Non-Aligned Movement"
CUB_strengthen_the_nonaligned_movement_desc:0 "Always a cornerstone of Cuban foreign policy, the Non-Aligned Movement was founded as a way for neutral nations to avoid taking a side in the Cold War era. Now that the drums of war have started to beat once more, maybe it is time for the organization to band closer together, with military cooperation to protect our weaker members from the circling imperialist vultures."
CUB_assist_in_international_development:0 "Assist in International Development"
CUB_assist_in_international_development_desc:0 "Our recent proposal to militarize the Non-Aligned Movement has been controversial, to say the least. To show that we mean well for everyone and that the reforms aren't just a facade for imperialist ambitions, we will reinforce and expand support for development, showing the Movement that we will always cherish and support its members."
CUB_rebuild_ties_with_third_world:0 "Rebuild Ties with the Third World"
CUB_rebuild_ties_with_third_world_desc:0 "With our increased political and military commitments to the NAM, it has become necessary to reaffirm friendly relations with the Third World nations. State visits, and expanded cultural initiatives will do a lot to bring us into their good graces and ensure that they stand by our side, should we commit to further militarize the movement in the future."

CUB_distance_ourselves_from_the_major_powers_desc:0 "Having expanded the role and reach of the NAM, it is time to show those who have trusted us that we mean it when we denounce imperialism. The UN shall be our Rubicon, Cuba will show itself as the torchbearer of the anti-imperialist struggle, burning any bridges we may have with the major powers of the world."
CUB_form_a_neutrality_pact:0 "Form a Neutrality Pact"
CUB_form_a_neutrality_pact_desc:0 "While it has been proposed by many inside our administration to fully militarise the NAM, such a proposal would be not only a slap in the face of the Movement's ideals but is also incredibly unpopular among the membership. A more limited proposal instead calls for a defensive alliance between NAM states, that would act only against aggression committed upon member states, ensuring we stand firm around the ideal of non-alignment."

CUB_common_front_against_imperialism_desc:0 "Our commitment to the cause of anti-imperialism cannot be half baked, in order to ensure the safety of those who refuse to bow to the great powers, the Non-Aligned Movement shall be reorganized into a proper military alliance. The only way for the neutral countries of the world to survive is to stand together and stand together unwaveringly, making any superpower considering violating our neutrality think twice."

CUB_end_the_conflict_with_atlanta_desc:0 "The Struggle against the United States and its successor, the American Republic, has been ongoing ever since Fidel Castro nationalized American property. Now that he and his regime are gone, maybe it is time to turn the page and restore relations with our traditional trade partner, beginning a new era of cross-strait relations. We have no need to continue Castro’s petty feuds."
CUB_restore_interstraits_tourism:0 "Restore Inter-straits Tourism"
CUB_restore_interstraits_tourism_desc:0 "The American Embargo did all too much to keep American tourists from our shores. With the thaw with Atlanta going well, it is time to revive what once used to be the driving motor of the Cuban economy: American tourism. There is a lot to gain by luring the Yanquis back to our beaches and hotels, ensuring friendship with Atlanta and reunifying families divided since the days of the revolution."
CUB_invite_american_arms_companies:0 "Invite American Arms Companies"
CUB_invite_american_arms_companies_desc:0 "Despite the stereotypes surrounding Americans and guns, it is undeniable that they have extensive knowledge on the matter and a large military-industrial complex to turn said knowledge into reality, even after the collapse of the old American state. As we drift further into the American sphere, perhaps there is room for a mutually beneficial agreement, such as handing generous contracts to their weapons manufacturers in exchange for them producing said equipment locally."
CUB_reaffirm_the_1903_treaty:0 "Reaffirm the Cuban-American Treaty of Relations"
CUB_reaffirm_the_1903_treaty_desc:0 "With the increased ties between the Atlanta Government and ours, and the dangers posed to our government, the only reasonable step to take is to reinstate the Cuban–American Treaty of Relations of 1903. Despite the opposition cries about it being a surrender of our hard-fought independence, the reinstated treaty will ensure that the Cuban republic will be backed by the might of the American army."

CUB_reconnect_with_new_russian_government_desc:0 "With the collapse of the Soviet Union and the birth of a new sovereign Russian state, the status of our relationship with Moscow has been left in a limbo. Finding compatible goals with the Kremlin's new occupants and needing a reliable partner in the world, maybe it is time to seek a clarification of our relationship with Russia and secure their protection against the Yanqui menace up north?"
CUB_form_partnership_between_uim_and_izhmash:0 "Form a Partnership Between UIM and IZhMASh"
CUB_form_partnership_between_uim_and_izhmash_desc:0 "The recent expansion of the Cuban army has stretched our production capabilities to their limit and many units find themselves woefully underequipped, an opportunity has arisen from Russia’s struggles to find partners for their military-industrial complex. Establishing a working partnership between them and the UIM will go a long way to helping satisfy both of our needs."
CUB_a_springboard_to_north_america:0 "A Springboard to North America"
CUB_a_springboard_to_north_america_desc:0 "Our position right in the middle of the Caribbean Sea offers a great opportunity to control the region, to both deepen our ties to Moscow and counter the Yanqui-Canadian presence in the area, a major expansion of our naval bases will enable the Russian navy to project power in the Americas for the first time since the collapse of the Soviet Union, ensuring their might and advancing our goal to protect Cuba."
CUB_join_the_moscow_accord:0 "Join the Moscow Accord"
CUB_join_the_moscow_accord_desc:0 "Having opened our doors to Russian forces and influence, it is an obvious fact that the next course of action is to formally join the Moscow Accord, to ensure that we stand with our Russian comrades in the coming struggle, showing the Yanquis that the might of Russia and their allies stand behind Cuba, should they try to put us in chains once again."
CUB_the_new_constitution:0 "The New Constitution"
CUB_the_new_constitution_desc:0 "With the terrorist crisis behind us at last, the time is ripe to modernize the Constitution to serve the needs of the 21st century, granting additional rights to the people and strengthening the political system while preserving the socialist character of our state, in anticipation of the eventual handover of power to the next generation of Cuban socialists. With our victory, the people surely will stand by the Cuban revolution and our leadership."
CUB_irrevocability_of_socialism:0 "The Irrevocability of Socialism"
CUB_irrevocability_of_socialism_desc:0 "The people have spoken, and socialism is what they've insisted upon. Despite the threats and sabotage of the liberal seditionists, they have not wavered from our side, and given their assent that we continue upon the road laid out by the Cuban Revolution. Step by step, year by year, we are proving to the nation and the world that in Cuba, Socialism will not and cannot be reverted!"
CUB_reaffirm_our_principles:0 "Reaffirm our Principles"
CUB_reaffirm_our_principles_desc:0 "We, the Communist Party of Cuba, stand for democracy, Marxism, and the sovereignty of the Cuban people in equal measure.

CUB_reform_the_government:0 "Reform the Government"
CUB_reform_the_government_desc:0 "Socialism may have survived, but we still came unacceptably close to the end of our revolution. The people have made it clear they prefer us to bourgeois “democracy” but without a significant amount of course correction, that may not last. We need reform, and we need it now."
CUB_reform_the_judiciary:0 "Reform the Judiciary"
CUB_reform_the_judiciary_desc:0 "The judicial system in many ways has not progressed since the early days of the revolution. In order to bolster confidence in our government, we will implement multiple reforms to our nation’s courts. Habeas Corpus and the presumption of innocence will be reinstated, the criminal code will be overhauled, and our legal system will be given a greater degree of flexibility, all measures designed to bring the judiciary up to speed with the 21st century."
CUB_embrace_state_secularism:0 "Embrace State Secularism"
CUB_embrace_state_secularism_desc:0 "Marx was very clear in his description of religion as the “opiate of the masses.” With the abolition of the capitalist regime, the need to medicate is gone, and so is the enmity from organized religion. Our decades-long regimen of State Atheism has been unduly harsh, and the various religious communities of Cuba are these days more interested in working with the government than against it. A rosary or two won’t damn the revolution, so let us loosen our grip on the spiritual aspirations of the people."
CUB_crackdown_on_corruption:0 "Crack Down on Corruption"
CUB_crackdown_on_corruption_desc:0 "Despite how much we would love to claim otherwise, not even communists are resistant to corruption. The security of our government is heavily dependent on the trust of our people, and nothing hurts that more than the sense that they are being governed for the sake of the highest bidder. We have let this slide for far too long, but no longer."
CUB_grow_the_communist_party:0 "Grow the Communist Party"
CUB_grow_the_communist_party_desc:0 "The enemies of the revolution love to paint the dictatorship of the proletariat as a collection of red-painted capitalists, an out of touch elite ruling over masses they have long since stopped caring for. This is laughably incorrect of course, but it’s an image we could certainly work to dispel. The Communist Party is meant to represent the people after all, no such organization could really have too many members."
CUB_meet_with_young_communist_league:0 "Meet with the Young Communist League"
CUB_meet_with_young_communist_league_desc:0 "The Young Communist League, the youth wing of the communist party of Cuba, is a crucial part of our government, allowing us to reach the youth of our nation with unparalleled efficiency, and hone the experience of the next generation of revolutionaries. If we are to continue the revolution into this century and beyond, we must ensure their efforts are coordinated with the rest of the party, lest our connection to the next generation of revolutionaries be weakened."
CUB_decriminalise_non_communist_parties:0 "Decriminalize Non-Communist Parties"
CUB_decriminalise_non_communist_parties_desc:0 "A mere loosening of party membership requirements isn’t enough. No matter what we do there will always be people in our nation who don’t fit even the broadest possible definition of “socialist.” The ban on non-communist parties must be lifted, to bring the opposition out in the open, where we can keep an eye on them and ensure that they too may work for the revolution."
CUB_broaden_the_party:0 "Broaden the Party"
CUB_broaden_the_party_desc:0 "The Communist Party should not just be a membership organization for the citizens, it should be the broadest possible party, representing every facet of the Cuban nation. On the model of the Soviet Union and our European allies, we should extend the influence and role of the Public Solidarity Organizations, into both civilian life and more crucially, the military. Only when the Communist Party has a representative in every room can we say that we truly represent the nation."
CUB_prepare_the_next_generation:0 "Prepare the Next Generation"
CUB_prepare_the_next_generation_desc:0 "No matter how cliche the phrase itself has become, it remains an undeniable fact that the youth are our future. We can not afford to simply rest on our laurels and ignore the reality that the current generation of revolutionaries won’t be able to fight for the working class forever. The time has come to ensure the revolution does not fall to stagnation."
CUB_embrace_the_napp:0 "Embrace the National Assembly of People's Power"
CUB_embrace_the_napp_desc:0 "The Revolutionary Armed Forces may be the defender of the revolution, the sword and shield of the Cuban people, but it is not meant for governing. The NAPP are the representatives of the popular will and they have kept our revolution civilized and stable for decades. Our future lies in stable, truly democratic governance."
CUB_law_on_cooperatives:0 "The Law on Co-operatives"
CUB_law_on_cooperatives_desc:0 "Central planning was an important step in the development of our nation, but it in and of itself is not socialism. As our economic reforms continue on ahead, the National Assembly of People’s Power has set forth measures designed to promote the creation of worker cooperatives, to preserve the socialist character of our economy, and make true on the promises of the revolution."
CUB_expand_etecsa:0 "Expand ETECSA"
CUB_expand_etecsa_desc:0 "As part of our mission to truly bring Cuba into the 21st century, we need to ensure the Cuban people are connected to it. ETECSA has been doing a commendable job providing Cubans with telephone service for over a decade, but now is the age of the intranet. In order to keep pace with the rest of the world ETECSA must be given more resources, to ensure that the company can provide for all of our needs with telecommunications and electronics in the digital era."
CUB_energise_public_solidarity_organisations:0 "Energize the Public Solidarity Organisations"
CUB_energise_public_solidarity_organisations_desc:0 "From farmers’ associations to student unions, Cuba is home to countless organizations designed to foment solidarity amongst out citizens. In order to breathe new life into the revolution, and shore up public support for our government, we must renew the enthusiasm of these organizations with which they can bring the people and the Communist Party even closer together."
CUB_reorient_the_military:0 "Reorient the Military"
CUB_reorient_the_military_desc:0 "In the modern age the Cuban military has strayed far from its original purpose. The move away from interventionism has given it room to become more of a business actor than an actual military organization. Making money is not what any military, especially not a revolutionary one, should be focused on. It’s time to remind the armed forces of their true role in Cuban society."
CUB_emphasise_castroism:0 "Emphasise Castroism"
CUB_emphasise_castroism_desc:0 "The mission of the Party has always been to serve the people, and this purpose has yet again been reaffirmed with our reforms. Now, the Cuban state stands stronger, leaner, more capable of fulfilling this noble goal than ever. This grand mission has inspired us for decades, and shall inspire for decades more, as we continue to dedicate our all to the people, as Comrade Fidel intended."
CUB_stand_against_terrorism:0 "Stand Against Terrorism"

CUB_activate_the_cdrs:0 "Activate the CDRs"
CUB_activate_the_cdrs_desc:0 "The Committees for the Defense of the Revolution are a network of loyal, vigilant citizens constantly on the lookout for threats to the Cuban government. They served us well before, and it is time they do so again. The Communist Party will move to reactivate the Committees, and create yet another apparatus with which we can strike at threats to our people."
CUB_fund_national_revolutionary_police:0 "Increase Funding for the National Revolutionary Police"
CUB_fund_national_revolutionary_police_desc:0 "Law enforcement is at the front line in the fight against terrorism. Though our intelligence services are typically more suited for rooting out terrorist cells and preventing their activities in the first place, when an attack slips through the cracks or a raid needs to be done, it is typically police officers who must take on the duty. As such, we should provide our nation’s law enforcement officers with additional resources to do their duty and keep our people safe."
CUB_peace_returns_to_cuba:0 "Peace Returns to Cuba"
CUB_peace_returns_to_cuba_desc:0 "Finally, after so many years of uncertainty and fear, the Cuban people can rest. Though the terrorist threat will likely never truly vanish entirely so long as reactionaries and capitalist nations persist, through unrelenting effort on the part of our government the threat they pose has, for now, been sufficiently defeated. The nation breathes a sigh of relief as a weight is removed from its chest, peace has returned, may it never again leave."
CUB_embrace_the_far:0 "Embrace the Revolutionary Armed Forces"
CUB_embrace_the_far_desc:0 "Who was there when the imperialists came to snuff out our revolution? Who has always been standing at the ready to strike in defense of our revolution when it is threatened? The military. The FAR as an institution is inherently closer to the people and better prepared to take necessary action in defense of the revolution. Our future lies in their strength and valiant experience."
CUB_expand_revolutionary_navy:0 "Expand the Revolutionary Navy"
CUB_expand_revolutionary_navy_desc:0 "As an island nation, we are uniquely vulnerable to invasion. Every centimeter of coastline is a potential target for our enemies, and we must ensure the waters surrounding us are kept secure. The Revolutionary Navy is our first line of defense against imperialist encroachment, so let us ensure it is strong enough to fulfill its purpose."
CUB_equal_opportunity_conscription:0 "Equal Opportunity Conscription"
CUB_equal_opportunity_conscription_desc:0 "In the past, women have been excluded from the call to fight for Cuba and the revolution, and as the 21st century dawns this reality becomes harder and harder to defend. The women of our nation are no less capable of fighting for what is right than their male comrades, it’s time we recognize this fact and ensure that we live up to the decades long promises of equality."
CUB_open_for_small_business:0 "Open for Small Business"
CUB_open_for_small_business_desc:0 " It is a simple fact that pure command economies just don't work. Humans are not cogs in a machine, no matter how convenient it is to think about them like they are. It's time we do what so many of our brethren have done and relax the restrictions on private, but still small, enterprise, to ensure the continued prosperity for our people."
CUB_support_GAESA:0 "Support GAESA"
CUB_support_GAESA_desc:0 "The revolution, like practically every endeavor in the modern world, requires funding, and as the military is the sword and shield of said revolution, it requires funding most of all. GAESA, the military's economic arm, must be supported so it can bring much needed funds and resources into the army's coffers."
CUB_emphasise_guevarism:0 "Emphasise Guevarism"
CUB_emphasise_guevarism_desc:0 "The mission of the Party has always been to stand for the downtrodden, to defend those too weak to defend themselves, a purpose we have not once wavered from. With our reforms, we have ensured a stronger, prouder Cuba, capable of standing against tyranny and repression wherever it may rear its head. Fatherland or death, we will continue the Revolution until victory, always!"
CUB_democratic_restoration:0 "The Democratic Restoration"
CUB_democratic_restoration_desc:0 "What we thought impossible has happened, we have found ourselves outplayed by the liberal opposition, with bourgeois ‘democracy’ and capitalism seemingly winning the hearts of the people, and the assent of the National Assembly. Panic and uncertainty consume the PCC, as we prepare for a competitive election, all the while voices inside the party cast doubt on the leadership of Raúl Castro."
CUB_release_political_prisoners:0 "Release Political Prisoners"
CUB_release_political_prisoners_desc:0 "With the new constitution and the end of our party state, the demand to address the many jailed dissidents has become too large to ignore. As we prepare to transition to a new democratic framework, a mass pardon will be issued to empty our prisons of those guilty of peaceful counterrevolutionary activities, letting them return to civilian life, to the celebrations of the liberal opposition."
CUB_2011_Election:0 "The 2011 General Election"
CUB_2011_Election_desc:0 "The historic day has come at last, as, for the first time since 1948, free multiparty elections will be held in Cuba. While we call on the people to defend the revolution and its achievements with a renewed vision under our new General Secretary Mariela Castro Espín, it's not certain we still command their loyalty, and the elections could be anyone's game as the people march to the polls to choose the ruling party."
CUB_presidente_mariela_castro:0 "Presidente Mariela Castro Espín"
CUB_presidente_mariela_castro_desc:0 "The revolution yet lives! Despite the fall of the communist constitution, the good will many still feel toward the communist party is as lively as ever! The revolution has survived, and it is our job now to ensure it will not just survive, but endure."
CUB_reform_the_party:0 "Reform the Party"
CUB_reform_the_party_desc:0 "Many liberals and rightists considered the fall of the communist constitution the end of communism in Cuba, they were wrong. The people have made it clear they still hold love in their hearts for the revolution. But if the Communist Party is to survive in this new era of Cuban politics, it must adapt to the new ecosystem. A new age means new tactics just as much as it means a renewed commitment to the wellbeing of the Cuban people."
CUB_reform_state_sector:0 "Reform the State Sector"
CUB_reform_state_sector_desc:0 "Under the communist constitution the state sector was one of the most powerful tools in our arsenal, a section of the economy under our control which we could use to directly assist the Cuban people. Though its power has been significantly reduced under the new constitution, it is still a valuable tool for supporting the revolution. As such it is crucial that we revamp and revitalize it so that it can once again be what the Cuban people need it to be."
CUB_empower_union_stewarts:0 "Empower Union Stewarts"
CUB_empower_union_stewarts_desc:0 "Unions are ultimately meaningless if they have no ability to enforce what authority they have. This is why the Communist Party has decided to pass a series of legislation designed to empower the most stalwart frontline soldier of organized labor: the union steward. They will be given more authority and power to take action in defense of their fellow union members, and ensure that they are not simply ignored by whatever power they may be speaking to. The workers’ right to a say in their workplace can not, and God willing will not, be infringed."
CUB_adjust_price_subsidies:0 "Adjust Price Subsidies"
CUB_adjust_price_subsidies_desc:0 "It is our duty as the protectors of the Cuban people to ensure they are provided with basic necessities. This is why, despite the objections of more liberal minded politicians, the PCC maintains a subsidised system of rationing to fulfill that exact need. That being said, the system is quite the drag on public finances, which is why we have opted to make a serious attempt at reforming it. We will adjust it to be more responsive to changes in the market and overall less expensive for the state, all while largely maintaining the same level of service to the Cuban people, and the public support said service provides us."
CUB_new_housing_projects:0 "Construct New Housing Projects"
CUB_new_housing_projects_desc:0 "Housing is a basic need, and too many in our country are going without that need adequately met, forced to rely on aging or cramped homes to have a roof over their head. As such the Communist Party has approved an initiative to construct multiple new, modern housing projects across the island. The people must believe that the government is on their side, and it will be a lot easier to do that with spacious homes and modern amenities."
CUB_support_biomedical_industry:0 "Support the Biomedical Industry"
CUB_support_biomedical_industry_desc:0 "Always a point of pride for the PCC and the Cuban nation, our biomedical sector has won us praise from abroad thanks to our humanitarian missions, but most importantly it has served the revolution in improving the quality of life of the average Cuban, saving thousands of lives and helping treat many previously endemic illnesses on the isle. It is quite frankly our duty to bolster our support for it at this point, so it may further assist the people."
CUB_to_the_defense_of_democracy:0 "To the Defense of Democracy"
CUB_to_the_defense_of_democracy_desc:0 "If there is one thing we learned from our humiliation at the constitutional debates, it’s that the people want democracy. So then, let us become the champions of democracy to the people, and demonstrate the unity of the left around the cause of democracy. If we are considered the shields and swords of what they hold dear, then their loyalty will be unshakable."
CUB_a_democratic_revolution:0 "A Democratic Revolution"
CUB_a_democratic_revolution_desc:0 "Despite what our many detractors may claim, the revolution is not incompatible with a democratic system. Some necessary changes may have to be made to both the revolution and our new government, but the people will not be deprived of their voice. The communist party has stood in defense of their best interests for decades, and this will not change simply because there are now more options on the ballot."
CUB_return_power_to_cdrs:0 "Return Powers to the CDRs"
CUB_return_power_to_cdrs_desc:0 "The CDRs were but one of many victims of the democratic transition. Stripped of the informal powers which made them such a useful tool for the proletariat and reduced to little better than glorified homeowners' associations. This injustice cannot be allowed to stand, it is our duty to ensure the CDR's are given the power they deserve to protect both the revolution and the public."
CUB_legalise_gay_marriage:0 "Legalize Gay Marriage"
CUB_legalise_gay_marriage_desc:0 "We as a nation have claimed since the 1950s to be a force for progress and change, and yet we have denied countless people the basic right to marry, to have their love for another person enshrined in law? Our party has not been a great friend to its queer citizens in the past, and if we can truly hope to stand tall in our mission of liberation, that simply cannot remain the case."
CUB_progressive_patriotism:0 "Progressive Patriotism"
CUB_progressive_patriotism_desc:0 "The Cuban people have great reason to take pride in our country. Ever since the revolution began in 1953 we have stood as one of the few beacons of solidarity in the imperialist fortress that was the American continents. In honor of this history, President Mariela has announced her intention to extend this legacy even further. From now on, the Cuban people will take pride not only in our nation’s unity and socialist prosperity, but its status as a land of the truly free where all people, no matter their identity or origin, can live a fulfilling and prosperous life."

CUB_expose_liberal_hypocrisy_desc:0 "Even now, as the Cuban people have once again shown the world they stand with us and the global revolution, the champions of capital claim we are subverting the will of the people. They tell the world we are tyrants and autocrats and yet they stand in staunch support of the bourgeoisie's ‘right’ to dictate the lives of the common people. It’s time to remind both Cubans and the world what these supposedly ‘democratic’ movements truly stand for, and more importantly, who is truly on their side."
CUB_defend_our_public_solidarity_organisations:0 "Defend our Public Solidarity Organisations"
CUB_defend_our_public_solidarity_organisations_desc:0 "The Public Solidarity Organizations have been through hard times lately. Thanks to their association with the old government, many efforts have been made to reduce their power and discredit their role in Cuban society. This is absolutely unacceptable, these institutions are key to the welfare of not only the revolution, but also the Cuban people. This is why we must actively fight back against the efforts to destroy them more than ever. Solidarity is a key component of communism, and we cannot allow it to be threatened."
CUB_favouritise_the_workers_central_union_of_cuba:0 "Favoritize the Workers' Central Union of Cuba"
CUB_favouritise_the_workers_central_union_of_cuba_desc:0 "There are plenty of unions in Cuba, especially now since the abolition of the communist constitution allowed for them to form completely independently of state control. We, as communists, obviously support the workers’ right to organize, but that being said, we can’t afford to have the workers completely separated from the party, split off into various small unions unable to effectively campaign for their rights. Because of this we will make an active effort to promote the CTC, our trade union affiliate, encouraging some of the newer unions to join it and supporting it most of all so our workers will be most effectively represented."
CUB_closed_shop_legislation:0 "Pass Closed Shop Legislation"
CUB_closed_shop_legislation_desc:0 "Despite the setbacks suffered by the CTC after 2010, under our leadership the red unions have managed to rebuild and restore their predominance over the labor movement, despite the challenges posed by the liberal yellow unions. To further support them, we will pass closed-shop legislation that will permit workplaces to require union membership as a condition for employment, ensuring that unionized workers will not be undercut by their non-union counterparts, and the CTC by the yellow trade unions."
CUB_audit_the_far:0 "Streamline the Revolutionary Armed Forces"
CUB_audit_the_far_desc:0 "After the end of the Cold War and especially under Raul Castro's rule, the FAR has turned from military command to private business, leading them to forget their original mission, something that in the dangerous times we live in we cannot allow to continue anymore. By transferring their holding companies to the Ministry of the Economy and Planning, we can ensure that they will return to their original mission, the defense of the nation and the Cuban revolution."
CUB_limit_campaign_contributions:0 "Limit Campaign Contributions"
CUB_limit_campaign_contributions_desc:0 "As long as money has a voice in politics, the wealthy and foreign interests will use theirs to drown out the voice of the people and get their way. It is crucial to the security of the revolution that our enemies not have the chance to undermine our rule, so we must ensure that their backers don't have the opportunity to do so."
CUB_peoples_democracy:0 "A People's Democracy"
CUB_peoples_democracy_desc:0 "Through much effort and clever political maneuvering, we have reforged this new democracy into one in our image, a true people’s democracy. The people still have their say of course, but at the end of the day the revolution continues largely unimpeded. A new golden age has dawned for Cuba, and we are all very lucky to be a part of it."
CUB_presidente_vladimiro_roca:0 "Presidente Vladimiro Roca"
CUB_presidente_vladimiro_roca_desc:0 "The Cuban people have chosen renewal over stagnation and delivered a decisive victory to the dissident son of the revolution, who has promised to not only build a new Cuba, free of communist tyranny, but to undo the myth of the Cuban revolution entirely, bringing the truth to light after over fifty long years in darkness, and liberating Cuba from the PCC’s regime of lies."
CUB_showcase_true_nature_of_castroism:0 "Showcase the True Nature of Castroism"
CUB_showcase_true_nature_of_castroism_desc:0 "Castro enjoyed decades of lying to the people about the nature of his regime, but one cannot fool everyone all the time, and now that we have control of the government, we can get to work exposing these falsehoods for what they are. By torpedoing the basis of their legends, like the status of the army, we can untangle the webs of lies that hold up the support for these oppressors of the people."
CUB_benefits_of_democracy:0 "The Benefits of Democracy"
CUB_benefits_of_democracy_desc:0 "While the Castroist dictatorship is gone, it doesn't mean that people have realized what that means. Some, still under the sway of the old regime’s propaganda, are scared of the potential instability the new system could bring. We need to educate the people that democracy will create better governance as the new government is more beholden to the people than the PCC ever was. Only with the faith of the public can we ensure that Cuban pluralism doesn't get smothered in the cradle."
CUB_cordon_off_the_communists:0 "Cordon off the Communists"
CUB_cordon_off_the_communists_desc:0 "Now finally out of power, the PCC cannot be allowed to worm its way back into power at any cost. A cordon sanitaire with the other democratic forces in the National Assembly will isolate the communist deputies and ensure they cannot harm our young democracy and reverse the gains of the people’s constitution. The so-called ‘enemies of the people’ now control the ship, and the self-declared ‘liberators’ won't fool the public anymore."
CUB_open_the_archives:0 "Open the State Archives"
CUB_open_the_archives_desc:0 "Many things were hidden away or distorted by the Castroist regime, using national security to bury their shame and turn failures into victories. Using the powers of the presidency, we will move to shed light on everything the PCC tried so dearly to keep the people ignorant about. This time, they won't be able to hide from their own words and deeds, their eternal 26-7 is coming down at last."
CUB_commit_to_legalism:0 "Commit to Legalism"
CUB_commit_to_legalism_desc:0 "A core component of any democratic system is a judicial system that isn't a hammer to use against those who speak against the state, but one that is mindful of the rights of the people and that is strong enough to resist pressures from above and make itself heard when issuing rulings. With the boot out of its throat, civil society will finally rise from the ashes and wrestle the streets away from the PCC."
CUB_enact_educational_reform:0 "Enact Educational Reform"
CUB_enact_educational_reform_desc:0 "For decades, the communists loved to have kids learn about their greatness, cramming propaganda into educational material of all stripes, from civics to simple maths problems. But now we can clear the slate and free education from being chained to communist lies, ensuring our kids can finally get the education they deserve, instead of learning about glories that never really were."
CUB_support_stem_sciences:0 "Support the STEM Sciences"
CUB_support_stem_sciences_desc:0 "Critical for technological progress and the development of complex machinery, the STEM sector has been requiring increased investments, which, if granted, would propel it to a level similar to our already famous biomedical industry. This would ensure Cuban brand prestige is known to everyone on the planet, providing high-quality goods and services while putting us ahead of competition such as Japan or Chile."
CUB_begin_the_transition:0 "Begin the Economic Transition"
CUB_begin_the_transition_desc:0 "Formerly controlled under a planned economy, such a model has shown its limits and shortfalls for the development of Cuba. But that doesn't mean we will listen to the monetarist firebrands in the ULC. Instead, we will look to the traditional social democratic model of a mixed economy, where we keep the essential sectors under public control, while only separating ourselves from the service sector and light industries."
CUB_democratic_solutions_for_economy:0 "Democratic Solutions for the Economy"
CUB_democratic_solutions_for_economy_desc:0 "As we work to reform the national economy, we have come across a hurdle in organizing things. The answer has been in front of us all this time, democracy itself will provide the answers we need to steer the transition to a favorable conclusion not only for the Cuban state but most importantly for the Cuban people, with people being free to discuss how the national economy is run, they will come to the best viable conclusion, without an overbearing state forcing certain, inefficient outcomes."
CUB_establish_joint_ventures:0 "Establish Joint Ventures"
CUB_establish_joint_ventures_desc:0 "Our industries are in dire need of both technical expertise and capital injections, both of which can be easily acquired by seeking joint ventures with private corporations from abroad, splitting the benefits and the costs will make their expansion into Cuba easier, and create more jobs for our growing population, while also showcasing the success of our economic transition."
CUB_reinvest_in_healthcare:0 "Reinvest in Healthcare"
CUB_reinvest_in_healthcare_desc:0 "While it has been one of the areas that the Castroist regime loved to showcase to the world, the fact remains that there is still much to be done in order to improve the state of the Cuban healthcare system. The easiest way is to give them more money to improve the chronically low salaries of the personnel and fix some of the more neglected hospitals in the Oriente or the rural areas."
CUB_satisfy_spiritual_needs:0 "Satisfy Spiritual Needs"
CUB_satisfy_spiritual_needs_desc:0 "Despite Cuba having tolerated the Catholic Church ever since the 70s, the PCC still discouraged spirituality, leading to a situation where coerced atheism became the norm in Cuba, but many still clung to their faith and now their requests for greater public presence and more independence can be allowed, letting religion fill the spiritual void that the ideological regime of old left."
CUB_reestablish_ties_with_exiles:0 "Reestablish Ties with the Exiles"
CUB_reestablish_ties_with_exiles_desc:0 "Cuban society has remained split into two halves ever since 1959, one half in Cuba proper, and the other in Florida, relations between the two groups being hostile ever since. But we have turned a new page here, and now that democracy is the law of the land, there is no reason not to bury the hatchet and reach out to our brothers on the other side of the straits, to reunite the Cuban nation once again."
CUB_support_new_trade_unions:0 "Support New Trade Unions"
CUB_support_new_trade_unions_desc:0 "The bedrock of the PCC has always been organized labor, even after their fall from power. Now that workers have seen the wonders of our democratic reforms, some are seeking new unions to join, and our allies inside the trade union movement have requested us to give them a hand, so that we may finally crack the dam and destroy the communist hegemony over organized labor in particular and Cuban civil society in general."
CUB_modernise_sugar_industry:0 "Modernise the Sugar Industry"
CUB_modernise_sugar_industry_desc:0 "Sugar has always been the most valuable export Cuba offered to the world. Even after the revolution proclaimed a break with Batista, sugar remained our primary product, but the industry has been hampered by a lack of investment and obsolete technology, resulting in harvests much lower than our potential. Addressing the deficiencies of the sugar industry will enable us to increase profits and divert more money to other areas, such as education and infrastructure, as well as giving us a propaganda victory over the PCC."
CUB_expand_our_highways:0 "Expand our Highways"
CUB_expand_our_highways_desc:0 "In recent decades, car ownership exploded in Cuba with the end of the so-called Blockade. This has left our current road network woefully under equipped to sustain the stress of the increased use. By expanding and improving our major roads we will not only make automobile usage easier, but also boost economic output as cross-country transportation becomes easier."
CUB_true_heir_of_jose_marti:0 "The True Heir of José Martí"
CUB_true_heir_of_jose_marti_desc:0 "For decades, the Castroist propaganda machine tried to co-opt the legacy of our greatest national hero. But like Fidel Castro said. "A truth well spoken, spoken in time, dissipates its enemies like smoke". We have spoken our truth and showed the Cuban people that those who ruled with fear cannot be the heirs to José Martí. Instead, we have risen to the occasion and reclaimed his legacy, restoring freedom to the people."
CUB_presidente_antonio_guedes:0 "Presidente Antonio Guedes"
CUB_presidente_antonio_guedes_desc:0 "The people have spoken and they have demanded liberalism, and that we will provide! Having seen our vision for Cuba as the best to bring a breath of fresh air into the nation, even the communists will in due time see the error of their ways, for neither an ox nor a donkey is able to stop the progress of liberalism."
CUB_triumph_of_liberalism:0 "The Triumph of Liberalism"
CUB_triumph_of_liberalism_desc:0 "With the administration now settled firmly into government, we have proven the Marxist theory of history wrong and shown to the world that liberalism is the pinnacle of human evolution, the final stage of historical materialism, and the end of history. Now that the communists and their influence are in retreat all across society, our unstoppable advance can finally lift Cuba up to the table of the prosperous nations of the earth, the road it will never be taken away from again."
CUB_begin_privatisation:0 "Begin Privatization"
CUB_begin_privatisation_desc:0 "The Castroist regime's crusade against the free market has left the state with a massive stake in the Cuban economy, even excluding the parts owned by the armed forces, holding our economic growth back severely. By selling off our holdings to the private sector, we will see the logic of capitalism lead us to levels of prosperity unseen in Cuban history, ensuring that our resources are used in the most effective way possible, bringing in the largest possible profits for our people."
CUB_attempt_a_compromise:0 "Attempt a Compromise"
CUB_attempt_a_compromise_desc:0 "It seems that the Cuban people are not yet ready for our transformation of the Cuban economy, the changes being too drastic for them to stomach. For the sake of stability, we should reach out to the CTC and attempt to find a deal so the workers can finally return to their jobs, even if it means our privatizations must be halted for the time being. We may be able to keep pace on other parts of our economic agenda while they get ready."
CUB_subsidise_political_parties:0 "Subsidize Political Parties"
CUB_subsidise_political_parties_desc:0 "The PCC’s former ban on political parties has left the political arena disorganized and chaotic, even if that chaos inevitably left the door open for liberalism. To fix this injustice, grants will be given to all political parties to help them build up their strength, giving everyone a chance to send their message out to the people."
CUB_support_the_press:0 "Support the Free Press"
CUB_support_the_press_desc:0 "For decades, the Cuban people could only get their news from the government, with the non-communist press banned. Now that free media is blossoming in the newly emancipated Cuba, it struggles to compete with established papers and suffer from a lack of capital. To help set information free, a program to shore up our press organizations will be organized to give independent newspapers a solid foundation to grow and bring the truth to the nation."
CUB_embrace_free_markets:0 "Embrace Free Markets"
CUB_embrace_free_markets_desc:0 "Free trade has always been the best way to run an economy, as every nation that focuses on its comparative advantages gets better goods at a lower cost. This was a truth that Castro rejected, at a great cost to the average Cuban. Reversing course will hopefully show our people that the PCC is wrong and that liberalism is the only way forward."
CUB_support_small_business:0 "Support Small Businesses"
CUB_support_small_business_desc:0 "The key to any capitalist economy is having a local capitalist class. Something that was suppressed during the Castroist era. To help bring prosperity to Cuba we need to support their entrepreneurial spirit so that such a class can come into existence and be an example of the new Cuba liberalism is building, one free from the shackles of socialism."
CUB_restore_the_senate:0 "Restore the Cuban Senate"
CUB_restore_the_senate_desc:0 "Abolished in 1976 by Fidel Castro, the Senate was meant to be a restraint on the lower chamber. By restoring it and returning its traditional functions to it, we will bring back the balance between the executive and the legislative powers, ensuring that the Cuban state doesn't devolve into autocracy again."
CUB_cuban_investment_forum:0 "The Cuban Investment Forum"
CUB_cuban_investment_forum_desc:0 "Despite the setbacks with privatization, there are still plenty of opportunities for foreign investors to open shop in the Cuban market. By establishing a yearly forum to attract investments into our economy, we will promote the idea that trade and capitalism are forces for good, contrary to the lies that Castro fed the republic for decades, and open a badly needed source of capital for our national economy."
CUB_rationalise_welfare_state:0 "Rationalize the Welfare State"
CUB_rationalise_welfare_state_desc:0 "It has become clear to us that despite being the point of pride for the whole nation, the welfare system is regretfully flawed and riddled with inefficiencies. Although some might suggest abolishing it entirely, this would simply be inhumane and thus contrary to our values. Mercifully, many of these can be rectified by the private sector while retaining the foundation in public hands, ensuring the best and most efficient solutions for everyone."
CUB_reattempt_privatisation:0 "Reattempt Privatization"
CUB_reattempt_privatisation_desc:0 "While our first attempt was thwarted by unexpectedly strong resistance from the CTC and our own weak starting point, we are now much better prepared to finally bring our dreams to fruition, for the future of our nation, we cannot fail. The people have seen the things liberalism can do, they will see the lies they were fed, and will let us bring the purest form of liberalism to the nation, so prosperity may finally arrive to our shores."
CUB_liberalism_begets_compromise:0 "Liberalism Begets Compromise"
CUB_liberalism_begets_compromise_desc:0 "We tried, but it seems that the Cuban people aren't ready to see our vision realized. Instead of chasing an impossible dream, it is time to turn to other projects: further liberalization of our society, entrenching the young democracy that we fought for, and even perhaps reconciling the PCC; to show that at the end of the day, we still have the best interests of Cuba at heart."
CUB_promote_political_debate:0 "Promote Political Debate"
CUB_promote_political_debate_desc:0 "There are many different political currents in Cuba and despite the inevitable disagreements and arguments, it would do well to foster the exchange of ideas, enabling all sides to see other perspectives, avoiding the danger of political tunnel vision, setting the stage for a healthy political culture based on harmony and cooperation between the many forces of the republic."
CUB_our_devotion_to_tolerance:0 "Our Devotion to Tolerance"
CUB_our_devotion_to_tolerance_desc:0 "While we began our government with the high hopes of banishing the red snakes from the country, the facts have shown that it was the wrong course of action. Instead, we should promote a new, different narrative that the free marketplace of ideas will let the people sort out the best political platform and that the state should remain above the fray, only ensuring the democratic guardrails stay in place."
CUB_open_state_enterprises_for_stakeholders:0 "Open State Enterprises for Private Stakeholders"
CUB_open_state_enterprises_for_stakeholders_desc:0 "Full-on privatization has proven an impossible feat. Instead of pursuing this unattainable goal, we will instead sell off minority stakes in state enterprises and rely on public-private partnerships to boost economic output and source extra capital for our companies, all while keeping them under the control of the government, giving us the best of both worlds. It's good when everyone wins in the end."
CUB_reject_monetarism:0 "Reject Monetarism"
CUB_reject_monetarism_desc:0 "We first came into government with an unwavering monetarist stance, but no plan survives contact with the enemy, and ours has been no exception to the rule. Monetarist liberalism has proven to have no home in Havana, and as such, adopting some measures of social capitalism has proven a necessity to keep ourselves competitive in the current political environment. Having already rejected full-scale privatization, it is clear that our old economic program has to go as well."
CUB_cuban_democratic_platform:0 "Establish the Cuban Democratic Platform"
CUB_cuban_democratic_platform_desc:0 "Our radically transformative agenda was met with heavy opposition, even from the other democratic forces. For the sake of protecting the progress made for Cuban democracy, a more conciliatory and gradualist approach needs to be agreed upon, one based on consensus rather than idealism, where everyone has a voice and together we can grant Cuba the healthy democracy it has long been denied."
CUB_liberalism_must_triumph:0 "Liberalism Must Triumph"
CUB_liberalism_must_triumph_desc:0 "We have come so far and with our victory close at hand, we cannot give up now. The people have put their trust in us to implement the promises of liberalism and liberty, and that we must deliver, no matter the lies of the CTC and the PCC. Privatization must happen, come hell or high water, for it is the only way to bring prosperity. Once it is done, they will see that they had no reason to fight us."
CUB_outlaw_central_workers_union_of_cuba:0 "Outlaw the Central Workers' Union of Cuba"
CUB_outlaw_central_workers_union_of_cuba_desc:0 "The CTC has constantly been a thorn in our side, resisting our efforts every step of the way, and trusting they would come to their senses, we tolerated them. But no more, they have been tainted by communism poison, leaving us no choice on the matter. By banning them, we will finally resolve the general strike, as the workers will return to their jobs and soon enjoy the fruits of our efforts, freed of negative influences."
CUB_enact_mass_scale_privatisation:0 "Enact Mass-Scale Privatization"
CUB_enact_mass_scale_privatisation_desc:0 "With privatization finally going according to schedule, we can begin to sell the state corporations to willing buyers, ensuring that efficiency becomes the driving force in our economy. Even the army’s own holding companies, quite possibly the largest in the country, will be subjected to our scrutiny, no matter what disgruntled reactions, which surely will disappear in time, may present themselves."
CUB_break_the_communist_party:0 "Break the Communist Party"
CUB_break_the_communist_party_desc:0 "The PCC has not taken our actions against the CTC and the state holdings lightly, and rumors abound regarding a conspiracy to reverse everything we have done for the good of the people. This is something we cannot allow to happen. By striking first, we will defeat them before they can rally their forces, banning any and all communist organizations and arresting their leaders in order to safekeep the republic and our reforms from communist reaction."
CUB_cuban_red_scare:0 "The Cuban Red Scare"
CUB_cuban_red_scare_desc:0 "The Communists seem to have gotten many outside their ranks under their spell, blinded by lies about our intentions, claiming that we have lost ourselves to tyranny and autocracy. They are mistaken. As Communist ideology refuses to release its grip over Cuba, even our erstwhile allies are suspect, and we must do all in our power to impart the danger posed by the Communists and their fellow travellers that have subverted the entire political system."
CUB_put_castros_on_trial:0 "Put the Castros on Trial"
CUB_put_castros_on_trial_desc:0 "At last, we need to decapitate the heads of the hydra that is the PCC, and for liberalism to prevail, the Castro Brothers need to be punished for their crimes. It won't be easy due to their popularity among a significant part of the population, but it has to be done, for liberalism won't be safe until the former tyrants are no longer able to threaten it and the last vestiges of communism can be banished from our nation for good."

CUB_free_and_open_country_desc:0 "[Root.liberlpathDesc]"
CUB_libs_good_desc:0 "Despite our severe setbacks in pursuit of our economic goals, we have managed to create a free Cuba for a free people, even if we had to scale back our wild promises of transformation due to national particularities. But perhaps it is for the better that it happened as it did, for only through dialogue and compromise is true prosperity and a better future possible."
CUB_libs_bad_desc:0 "We have done it. Despite everything the forces of authoritarianism threw our way, we have inevitably prevailed and now Cuba will see the benefits that unimpeded liberalism can provide. Eventually, everyone will see the justness of our cause and the necessity of our actions, and accept that the new Cuba was worth the birthing pains, giving life to a country free from the chains of the past."
CUB_presidente_oswaldo_paya:0 "Presidente Oswaldo Payá"
CUB_presidente_oswaldo_paya_desc:0 "On a platform of political and judicial reforms, we have been entrusted with the keys to the Palace of the Revolution.

CUB_restore_civil_society:0 "Restore Civil Society"
CUB_restore_civil_society_desc:0 "Long held under the thumb of the PCC, with their draconian laws and secret policemen stifling civic participation, civil society has long yearned to be free from its chains, with a new national assembly more aware of the needs of the people, a sweeping set of reforms will enable our people to express themselves free of fear."
CUB_cuban_bill_of_rights:0 "A Cuban Bill of Rights"
CUB_cuban_bill_of_rights_desc:0 "Inspired by its American counterpart, this law will greatly expand the protections and individual rights that the citizens of Cuba enjoy, ensuring that from now on, our people are no longer vulnerable to the state overreach. Only once it is passed can we call ourselves a nation of free people, free to speak and to worship."
CUB_those_who_acted_with_love:0 "Those who Acted with Love"
CUB_those_who_acted_with_love_desc:0 "Despite the disagreements between our party and the PCC, it would be foolish to claim that there are not also good, earnest Communists who wish the best for our country. By reaching out to those who genuinely wished to better the people’s lot through socialism, we can integrate even the old party of dictatorship into the new democratic Cuba and work together for the betterment of all."
CUB_beat_swords_into_plowshares:0 "Beat Swords into Plowshares"
CUB_beat_swords_into_plowshares_desc:0 "The Cuban army has grown into a gigantic leviathan, helped by the militarist policies of the Castroist government. Only tempting the government towards violent solutions for its problems, this leviathan needs to be cut down, and decisive action is needed to reduce the army to a smaller, more sensible size. War is never glorious, and only through disarmament can we help bring about a more just and peaceful world."
CUB_retire_old_generals:0 "Retire the Old Generals"
CUB_retire_old_generals_desc:0 "The top brass of the Revolutionary Armed Forces is filled with men raised and educated under the vision of the PCC. With our reforms to downsize the army, many of those men are out of step with our current needs, and fresh blood is desperately needed to ensure an army whose loyalty cannot be doubted and which knows its place. Offering them generous retirements will go a long way to renew the armed forces in a manner that will preserve stability and goodwill."
CUB_cuban_self_defense_forces:0 "Form the Cuban Self-Defense Forces"
CUB_cuban_self_defense_forces_desc:0 "Our less militaristic priorities require a new army for Cuba, one which, unlike the FAR, is only tasked to defend our lands from aggression, not to fight in the four corners of the world in the name of revolution. Such a reorganization will prevent our young from being sent abroad to die in needless wars, and end the spectre of Cuban militarism that has hung over the entire region for decades."
CUB_our_own_organisations:0 "Our Own Mass Organizations"
CUB_our_own_organisations_desc:0 "Despite what most of the opposition thinks of the mass organizations of the PCC, such as the CDRs, it is clear they have worked to rally a critical mass of supporters to their cause. And if you can't beat them, join them. By creating rival organizations and competing on equal footing with the communists we can bring our Christian vision to the masses and wrestle their loyalty away from the Castroists."
CUB_ally_catholic_church:0 "Ally the Catholic Church"
CUB_ally_catholic_church_desc:0 "Despite having long enjoyed the support from several high-ranking officials from the church, we can still further deepen our ties with them, creating a solid cornerstone for our policies while preserving the church's historical role in Cuban society, ensuring that we have their political backing as we continue to roll out our Christian Democratic experiment in Cuba."
CUB_invite_the_exiles_home:0 "Invite the Exiles Home"
CUB_invite_the_exiles_home_desc:0 "Many Cubans were forced from their homes as Castro ousted Batista in 1959, their descendants waiting for decades for their chance to return. In a gesture to further national reconciliation among all strands of Cuban society, President Payá will extend an invitation for those exiles who wish to return to do so, to demonstrate that Cuba has changed, that it can be a home for every Cuban, no matter what they believe in."

CUB_end_criminalisation_of_honest_enterprise_desc:0 "While rejecting the communist planned economy, President Payá nevertheless still believes in a socially conscious economy, inspired by Rhine Capitalism. As a first step on the journey towards a more humane economic model, the government will seek to promote the establishment of locally embedded small businesses to supplement our state sector, ensuring a just and fair economic transition."
CUB_reverse_expropriations:0 "Reverse Expropriations"
CUB_reverse_expropriations_desc:0 "As we transition away from economic planning, most industries nationalized after 1959 will be returned to private ownership. However, as per our promises of a mixed economy, strategic sectors such as oil and telecommunications, and the state corporations established after the revolution, will remain in our hands to protect our sovereignty and ensure those utilities continue to serve the people of Cuba."
CUB_form_christian_workers_union_of_cuba:0 "Form the Christian Workers' Union of Cuba"
CUB_form_christian_workers_union_of_cuba_desc:0 "One of the PCC's traditional strongholds has been organized labor, and if we want to challenge their hegemony we need to offer the workers a real alternative, ensuring not only the right to choose their union but also to free the labor movement from the shackles Castro put it on, giving all Cubans a voice in their workplace representation."

CUB_enact_codetermiantion_in_public_sector_desc:0 "Inspired by the old West German model of co-determination, opening the boards of state-owned industries to representatives from the workforce will help to ensure labor harmony and improve productivity by granting the workers a voice on how the company is run and further involving them in the management of their firms."
CUB_invite_canadian_investers:0 "Invite Canadian Investers"
CUB_invite_canadian_investers_desc:0 "Always a friend of Cuba, even before 1959, Canada has become the premier capitalist power ever since the downfall of the USA in 1987. With our economy needing capital and their businesses hungering for investment opportunities, we will invite several Canadian businessmen to visit our island and set up shop, facilitating trade between Ontario and Havana and deepening our relations with Canada and the Democratic League in the process."
CUB_embrace_social_market:0 "Embrace Social Market Economics"
CUB_embrace_social_market_desc:0 "While we have embraced social capitalism, it doesn't mean we have to abandon our people to the whims of the free market, by adopting a social market model, we can constrain the worst excesses of capitalism in a manner that still leaves room for innovation and progress, ensuring that every citizen of the republic has a chance to triumph in life with a leveled playing field, and truly let the last become the first."
CUB_setting_the_good_example:0 "Setting the Good Example"
CUB_setting_the_good_example_desc:0 "The nation has come a long way since the end of the Castroite dictatorship, and now we can finally look back and see that we have done well. President Payá has shown to the region and the world that there is always an alternative to bitter polarisation and social conflict. If Cuba can reconcile people with such diverse beliefs from communism to hardline capitalism and make them work together for a better homeland for all, why shouldn't we offer this as an example for others?"

In the darkest hour ever since Bay of Pigs, the National Assembly has seen no option but to call El Comandante, the only person capable of keeping the government and the nation together even in his old age, back into the presidency. With a vow of revenge, Compañero Fidel has promised that those who dared attack us will pay dearly."
CUB_uncover_el_cabro:0 "Uncover El Cabro"
CUB_uncover_el_cabro_desc:0 "Despite a year-long campaign of terror, we still have yet to catch up with the man responsible! He and his band of zealots must be defeated to avenge Raúl. With the DGI hard at work, most of their hideouts have already been localized, letting us get one step closer to uncovering the leader of the terrorist scourge and wiping him and his ilk from the face of the Earth."
CUB_terrorise_the_terrorists:0 "Terrorize the Terrorists"
CUB_terrorise_the_terrorists_desc:0 "With the plans to strike back against the terrorist plague almost completed, it is high time that we show them the true meaning of the word. Like ignorant children, they have ignited tiny cinders and called those a flame. But if they want to play with fire, we shall show them the true meaning of the word, and they shall tremble in fear when we incinerate their hideouts and leave nothing but ashes on the wind."
CUB_convict_the_criminals:0 "Convict the Criminals"
CUB_convict_the_criminals_desc:0 "Despite the threat of foreign invasion, there are some dissident elements that still dare to protest against our government, perhaps unaware of their role as useful idiots to Atlanta. These little acts of headless defiance must stop, and if they will not stop for the sake of peace and unity, then we have no choice but to make them stop. Ignorance of treachery is no defence."
CUB_avenge_raul:0 "Avenge Raúl"
CUB_avenge_raul_desc:0 "After 70 long years, the time has come to show that the Cuban people bow to nobody. In one fell strike, the American Republic will learn the consequences of their folly, as nuclear hellfire will burn their crimes away, and them along with it. The only thing remaining is for El Comandante to give the order to execute Operacíon Venganza. \n\n§RPatria o Muerte§!"
CUB_rectify_the_great_injustices:0 "Rectify the Great Injustices"
CUB_rectify_the_great_injustices_desc:0 "Despite having the best intentions, it has dawned on Fidel that huge mistakes had been committed throughout the revolutionary period, mistakes which have harmed many innocent Cubans. Those errors must be corrected and amends must be made for our shortcomings, so that we may, at last, continue the emancipatory task of the revolution. We cannot allow anything else."
CUB_reconcile_with_the_church:0 "Reconcile with the Church"
CUB_reconcile_with_the_church_desc:0 "The relationship between the Church and our government has never been an easy one, our outspoken atheist policy having caused a large exodus in the early days of the revolution and despite having softened our stance towards religion since, things were never friendly. Having been affected by Operacion Venganza, Fidel sees that the distance between Catholic teachings and our own isn't a large one. From reconciliation will come stability and renewed understanding, leading to a more fair future for all of Cuba."
CUB_form_a_broad_progressive_alliance:0 "Form a Broad Progressive Alliance"
CUB_form_a_broad_progressive_alliance_desc:0 "The Revolution can never succeed if it is just a Communist project. If every effort we make in its furtherance is one that requires us to fight our fellow citizens, we will ultimately get nowhere. If we want to build a better Cuba for everyone, we need to expand the tent of the revolution, reaching out to those in the opposition that wish to talk and start the arduous walk towards understanding."
CUB_apologise_to_the_LGBTQ_community:0 "Apologize to the LGBTQ Community"
CUB_apologise_to_the_LGBTQ_community_desc:0 "During the early stages of the revolution, many Cubans found themselves being targeted for who they loved, fired from their jobs, and even sent to labor camps for ‘rehabilitation’. Despite more moderate policies since the 80s, discrimination and homophobia still linger, sentiments that Comrade Fidel has decided to eradicate from our nation, in order to make amends for one of his biggest mistakes."
CUB_finish_anti_racist_struggle:0 "Finish the Anti-Racist Struggle"
CUB_finish_anti_racist_struggle_desc:0 "Despite the revolution's promises of progress and equality , it remains clear that our black comrades still suffer from social inequality and poverty in larger numbers than the average Cuban. Changing their situation will demand effort and money, both of which Compañero Fidel is willing to spend to rectify one of the most significant oversights of the revolution."
CUB_compensate_the_victims:0 "Compensate the Victims"
CUB_compensate_the_victims_desc:0 "During the many decades of the PCC rule over Cuba, there have been many instances of citizens having their civil rights violated, unfairly associated with those who tried to undermine the revolution, with cases dating back to even the early days of the revolution. While being aware that money cannot turn back time only serves as a bandaid, the work has to begin somewhere, hopefully helping heal just some of the damage done."
CUB_meet_with_cuban_federation_of_women:0 "Meet with the Federation of Cuban Women"
CUB_meet_with_cuban_federation_of_women_desc:0 "Despite the revolution doing much to equalize gender relations, championed by the Federation of Cuban Women and the late Vilma Espín, there is still a lack of representation in the hall of power, among other shortcomings caused by misplaced priorities. By reaching out and embedding the Federation in our work for gender equality, take leaps where we once took mere steps, and bring a final end to gender discrimination in our country."
CUB_extend_the_revolutionary_mercy:0 "Extend the Revolutionary Mercy"
CUB_extend_the_revolutionary_mercy_desc:0 "Many families have seen relatives disappear into our prisons due to their actions against our government. Eager to showcase the changes that have happened in our country and reduce the costs of upkeep, mass pardons will be issued to many political prisoners, some of whom have been imprisoned for decades. While a controversial move, this is the only way to turn the page and finally show ourselves to be better than the tyrants we denounce."
CUB_reverse_the_movement:0 "Redeem the Movement"
CUB_reverse_the_movement_desc:0 "Mistakes were made, huge ones that tainted and corrupted the course of the Cuban Revolution. On occasion, we lost sight of our goals and forgot the people we were supposed to serve, but no more! A new revolution is about to be born from the old one, a revolution for and by the people, one free from the mistakes of the past and one that can be what it was always supposed to be."
CUB_return_state_farms_to_campesinos:0 "Return State Farms to the Campesinos"
CUB_return_state_farms_to_campesinos_desc:0 "Despite our efforts to dismantle the latifundias of old, the state ultimately ended up taking them over and running them in all too similar fashions, making land reform too much of a slogan and too little of a reality. Mindful of such naive overcorrections, the government and Comrade Fidel especially have seen fit to distribute the state farms to the campesinos, ensuring that they are the true owners of the land that they toil."
CUB_criticise_the_bureaucracy:0 "Criticize the Bureaucracy"
CUB_criticise_the_bureaucracy_desc:0 "The threat of bureaucratization has always been hanging over every revolution, representing stagnation and the loss of dynamism. Something that has regretfully also affected us and yet we can still act to rectify it. Calling for renovation and renewal, Comrade Fidel hopes to inject new life into the public service, freeing it from becoming enslaved by its own rules and regulations, turning it into an arm of the revolution once again."
CUB_launch_war_against_waste:0 "Launch a War Against Waste"
CUB_launch_war_against_waste_desc:0 "The end of the Blockade caused abundance unseen before in Cuba, and with abundance came waste. Excess has polluted our nation as we disregarded our future for a carefree present. To preserve our natural wonders for our children and ensure Cuba stays clean, waste must be defeated like Batista was before it. Like he led us to victory before, Compañero Fidel will lead us again, perhaps to one of the hardest battles of his career."
CUB_transition_from_state_capitalism:0 "Transition from State Capitalism"
CUB_transition_from_state_capitalism_desc:0 "During Raul's presidency, measures were taken to move ourselves away from a purely planned economy and introduce some market practices in our economy. Such measures have now outlived their usefulness and now it is time to move towards a more pure form of socialism, removing the capitalist elements for good."
CUB_red_ecology:0 "Red Ecology"
CUB_red_ecology_desc:0 "For decades, our underdevelopment has led to putting the environment on the back burner, giving priority to industrial development instead. But as Comrade Fidel once put it "Tomorrow it will be too late". We must ensure we leave a planet for the future of socialism to prosper and everyone, from the workers to the president himself must be aware of their role in protecting our homeland from ourselves."
CUB_the_empire_is_gone:0 "The Empire is Gone"
CUB_the_empire_is_gone_desc:0 "The siege we were subjected to by the Americans had a large effect on our country after 1959. With the forces of capital encircling us like sharks, we committed errors and acted out of zealotry to protect our homes, such baggage has been with us to this day. But, the empire is gone, it has been since 1987. The need to be on constant vigilance is gone, and so should our siege mentality likewise be. Disagreement does not equate with treachery, and it is nigh time we realize that."
CUB_remind_the_military_of_their_purpose:0 "Remind the Military of their Purpose"
CUB_remind_the_military_of_their_purpose_desc:0 "With the withdrawal from military internationalism, the army has grown complacent, generals have turned into businessmen, and many good men lost sight of their mission. Something not even the president can consider himself free from. But with our newfound dedication, the army must have their basic goal reiterated, not to play capitalist and investor, but to be the shield that protects the people and the revolution from aggression."
CUB_return_to_socialist_interventionism:0 "Return to Socialist Interventionism"
CUB_return_to_socialist_interventionism_desc:0 "Revolutionary Cuba has always been adept at punching above our weight class, aiding those willing to deal with us helped us circumvent the Yanqui blockade and earn international goodwill. While downsized at the end of the Cold War, a return to such policies will help us reestablish our position as one of the leading nations of the Western hemisphere."
CUB_transform_the_cdrs:0 "Transform the CDRs"
CUB_transform_the_cdrs_desc:0 "The CDRs' powers and profile have changed with the years, but they were always a tool of fear and suppression of dissidence at the local level. Following the recent crisis, Comrade Fidel has declared that their long watch is finally over. By turning them into homeowner associations and stripping them of their political roles as guardians of the revolution, we will preserve the good while the bad is cast into the dustbin of history."
CUB_allow_criticism_of_government:0 "Allow Criticism of the Government"
CUB_allow_criticism_of_government_desc:0 "Under the fears of counterrevolutionary activity, most criticism of the government was outlawed and the loudest voices were jailed, even those who spoke in good faith of the errors we committed. As the reforms continue, the time to undo the censorship regime has come, and let people point out our mistakes to us free of fear, lest we fall into a pit of self-delusion and willful ignorance."
CUB_affirm_our_non_partisan_democracy:0 "Reaffirm our Non-Partisan Democracy"
CUB_affirm_our_non_partisan_democracy_desc:0 "While ostensibly a nonpartisan system, the Cuban National Candidacy Commission always kept the scales tilted in our favor. Opening the system to everyone and ensuring an equal playing field will ensure that all voices can be heard inside the political sphere, showing to the opposition that Comrade Fidel is serious about his reforms."
CUB_abolish_the_death_penalty:0 "Abolish the Death Penalty"
CUB_abolish_the_death_penalty_desc:0 "While largely phased out ever since the turn of the century, capital punishment still remains in the books, despite the criticism we have come to face over keeping such a barbaric punishment. Formally abolishing it, however, will be a huge symbolic step forward for the revolution to take, showing that it has moved past such barbaric measures, at long last."
CUB_vas_bien_fidel:0 "Vas Bien, Fidel"
CUB_vas_bien_fidel_desc:0 "It was a long road to take, but one that had to be taken in order to cleanse the revolution from its many shortcomings. Something that only dawned on Fidel Castro after decades of errors and the death of a dear brother, but despite all the pain and rage, patience and love ultimately prevailed. Cuba is in a much better place than it has been ever before, despite all adversity. Now, he can finally be at ease with himself, and it can be safely asserted, Vas Bien, Fidel."
CUB_the_exiles_return:0 "The Exiles Return"
CUB_the_exiles_return_desc:0 "To the world's surprise, we have triumphed! With the last remnants of the Revolutionary Armed Forces defeated and freedom restored to the oppressed people of Cuba, the time is now to begin the arduous work of reconstruction and reform needed to undo decades of communist mismanagement and tyranny. Though we certainly have a long way to go before the Cuban people will see the light, we can now be confident that we shall never again be forced from our homes."
CUB_national_foundation_is_elected:0 "The National Foundation is Elected"
CUB_national_foundation_is_elected_desc:0 "Sanity and common sense have prevailed in the Liberty Council, and now the National Foundation stands as the singular legitimate representative of the Cuban people. It is ready to begin the arduous task of rebuilding the island, undoing decades of communist tyranny and mismanagement, and restoring order to a nation and a people that don’t seem to greet us as their liberators."

CUB_presidente_robert_menendez_desc:0 "Representing the Reconciler faction of the Liberty Council. Former representative and lawyer Robert Menendez has been appointed President of Cuba, his promises of reconciliation and democratization having won over the Council. However, the public still distrusts our government, and winning them over will demand careful maneuvering, all the while our supporters still clamor for revenge against the PCC."
CUB_restore_1940_constitution:0 "Restore the 1940 Constitution"
CUB_restore_1940_constitution_desc:0 "Having operated under martial law and a provisional constitution ever since our return to Havana, the time has come to bring back the old constitution to provide a legitimate basis for our government, as well as further civilianizing our administration. Most importantly though, it will signal our commitment to pluralism, showing the Cuban people we are different from the old Castroist regime."
CUB_amnesty_for_communist_rebels:0 "Amnesty for Communist Rebels"
CUB_amnesty_for_communist_rebels_desc:0 "While many inside the exile community clamor for the destruction of the Castroist guerrillas, President Menendez instead proposes a more pragmatic solution to the problem. Offering full pardons to those that surrender and hand over their weapons, the government hopes to win the active phase of the war offering them an easy way out of the mountains and back into civilian life, helping to integrate the supporters of the old regime into our political system."
CUB_meet_anti_communist_activists:0 "Meet with Anti-Communist Activists"
CUB_meet_anti_communist_activists_desc:0 "Despite being driven largely underground, Cuba itself still had a sizable number of opposition militants. With them finally emerging to the light in the wake of the liberation, there is much to win by reaching out to them and seeking compromises to further legitimize ourselves in the eyes of democratically minded Cubans and hopefully defrost our relations with the local anti communist activists."
CUB_foster_democratic_rebirth:0 "Foster a Democratic Rebirth"
CUB_foster_democratic_rebirth_desc:0 "With both communist loyalists and the domestic opposition having been dealt with, the next step to rebuild Cuban democracy is to promote participation in political life and the proliferation of political parties and interest groups, offering everyone, including our opponents, legal means of expressing themselves. This will not only improve our credibility but also weaken the appeal of the various violent groups by undermining their appeal among those disaffected with the government."
CUB_maintain_social_protections:0 "Maintain Social Protections"
CUB_maintain_social_protections_desc:0 "One of the most popular, and successful, lines of attack against us, the lie that we will overturn the social benefits granted to them during the Castoist era, has proven an obstacle to our attempts to reach out to the people. By amending the constitution to include a modified version of article 72 of the 1976 constitution, we will defang this talking point while also appeasing the population, even if most provisions will remain suspended until the end of martial law."
CUB_end_martial_law:0 "End Martial Law"
CUB_end_martial_law_desc:0 "Now that Cuba is largely pacified and the political environment has started to grow strong and healthy, the need for martial law is no longer strong enough to justify it. Lifting martial law will be the definite proof of our intentions to those who still doubt us, showing the liberal opposition that we are not monsters seeking to oppress the Cuban people, and enabling life and the economy to return to normalcy after years of chaos and conflict."
CUB_liberty_in_the_american_image:0 "Liberty in the American Image"
CUB_liberty_in_the_american_image_desc:0 "The Tree of Liberty has finally taken root in Cuba, what was once thought impossible has become a reality and a healthy democratic environment now dominates Cuban political life. At long last, the last emergency measures can finally be allowed to wither away and a new era of freedom and prosperity can be allowed to begin at long last."
CUB_call_new_elections:0 "Call Fresh Elections"
CUB_call_new_elections_desc:0 "With the country normalized, there is no better time to call for fresh elections and give the republic a government of, for, and by the people, with all the legitimacy this would give. Such an election would finally solidify our new political order, showcasing to the world that this new regime is not leaving anyone behind and that democracy has come to stay in Cuba."
CUB_reclaim_our_properties:0 "Reclaim our Properties"
CUB_reclaim_our_properties_desc:0 "As the Castroist bandits forced our parents and grandparents into exile during their revolt against the Batista administration, they saw their properties stolen and reformed into collective farms. Now the exile is over, many among the heirs to the land demand that their legitimate lands are returned to them, something we are too happy to oblige to, despite the protests of the communist squatters."
CUB_rebuild_the_armed_forces:0 "Rebuild the Armed Forces"
CUB_rebuild_the_armed_forces_desc:0 "With our liberation has come the need to build an army worthy of our new republic, and with the communist insurgents roaming the countryside and threatening to kick us back into the sea, such a time cannot come any sooner. Leaning on the many veterans of the liberation war to fill our depleted officer ranks, the new Constitutional Army will make the enemies of Cuba tremble."
CUB_invite_american_observers:0 "Invite American Observers"
CUB_invite_american_observers_desc:0 "The enormous sacrifices needed to liberate Cuba would have been impossible without the decisive backing of Atlanta. As efforts to rebuild the armed forces continue, inviting AR officers to advise our still-green military command will help to get the Cuban army up to Yankee standards and ensure that the island stands well protected against both foreign and domestic threats."
CUB_invite_american_corporations_back:0 "Invite American Corporations to Return"
CUB_invite_american_corporations_back_desc:0 "Expelled after 1959, many American corporations had made their peace with losing access to the Cuban market. But with our government stabilizing control over the island and initiating long-overdue economic reforms to revive the economy from the devastation of communist rule, the door has opened once more for the titans of industry to return to our soil and once more propel the Cuban economy to prosperity."
CUB_teach_cubans_of_capitalism:0 "Teach Cubans of Capitalism"
CUB_teach_cubans_of_capitalism_desc:0 "For decades on end, the Cuban people have been fed lies about the alleged vices of capitalism, a caricature meant to brainwash them into supporting a communist economy, and they have resisted us accordingly. As we work to steer the population into supporting our rule, we will teach them what real capitalism is meant to be: A system where everyone, if capable enough, can prosper. With some state assistance to kickstart it, a class of small business owners will soon populate the country, letting us co opt the most skilled members of the public for our own system."
CUB_decastroisation_trials:0 "Decastroization Trials"
CUB_decastroisation_trials_desc:0 "Despite the Castro brothers dying before we could get our hands on them, his regime was much larger than two men. Having captured many top communist officials during the liberation war, punishing them for their crimes is the only possible course of action to grant some justice to the victims of the Castroist tyranny and help shed some light to the truths that have been suppressed for decades."
CUB_dismantle_the_cdrs:0 "Dismantle the CDRs"
CUB_dismantle_the_cdrs_desc:0 "Having long been a tool of repression and mass vigilance upon the population, the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution have no place in our new free Cuba. By terminating them and reassigning what few positive elements may be found to the municipal governments, we will crush some of the last remnants of Castroism and get one step closer to closing that chapter of our history."
CUB_terminate_el_cabro:0 "Terminate El Cabro"
CUB_terminate_el_cabro_desc:0 "Despite having been a useful partner in our struggle against Castro's goons, El Cabro has outlived his usefulness as his zealots continue to harass the peasants and ambush our patrols. With the help of our friends back in Atlanta, we will decapitate the snake in one swift stroke and ensure that Cuba doesn't end up simply replacing one terrorist dictator with another."
CUB_justice_has_been_restored:0 "Justice has been Restored"
CUB_justice_has_been_restored_desc:0 "At last, our job has been done, a nation free of communist influences, Justice has been delivered to those that yearned for it ever since 1959. With such a great mistake now rectified and the natural order restored, Cuba now stands as a free state, ready to step into the future with confidence, the darkest chapter of its history now lying to rest for good."
CUB_presidente_otto_reich:0 "Presidente Otto Reich"
CUB_presidente_otto_reich_desc:0 "The Liberty Council has spoken and has demanded the total annihilation of the Castroite insurgency, enabling the hardliner Otto Reich to leverage his ties with Atlanta to secure the backing of the council and become the second President of a Free Cuba. With this, he will soon deliver the final victory over the remnants of the PCC and bring an end to communism, restoring order and stability to Cuba after decades of Castroite rule."
CUB_deploy_army_in_sierras:0 "Deploy the Army to the Sierras"
CUB_deploy_army_in_sierras_desc:0 "Despite the destruction of the FAR during the Liberation War, many of their troops chose to melt into the eastern Sierras, where they are occupying whole municipalities, severely hampering movements to and from the Oriente. Such a situation cannot be tolerated. With the deployment of our forces into the region, we will find their dens and flush the red rats out of their hiding holes for good."
CUB_intensify_anti_communist_propaganda:0 "Intensify Anti-Communist Propaganda"
CUB_intensify_anti_communist_propaganda_desc:0 "Decades of a state monopoly on TV and radio broadcasts have left scores of good Cubans brainwashed by the Castroist thugs. This monopoly can, however, be made to serve better masters and help to undo what the PCC did to the public for over 60 years, guiding the next generation of Cuban men and women away from communist lies as we use this opportunity to broadcast our side of the story."
CUB_form_cuban_national_republican_party:0 "Form the Cuban National Republican Party"
CUB_form_cuban_national_republican_party_desc:0 "With the entrenching of our administration comes the need to create an organ to rule the state. Fortunately for us, the PCC has left behind plentiful amounts of real estate and other infrastructure we can appropriate to serve our goals. By setting up a party apparatus mirroring that of the Republican Party in the American Republic, we can ensure that Cuba remains in good hands for the foreseeable future."
CUB_guided_by_the_hand_of_the_market:0 "Guided by the Hand of the Market"
CUB_guided_by_the_hand_of_the_market_desc:0 "For decades the Cuban people have been denied the fruits of trade and capitalism, constrained by a tyrannical state, but the time for freedom has come. By opening ourselves to trade with the free world, the people will see all the wonders that Castro kept from them, and in turn the people will flock to our side."
CUB_cuba_for_the_cubans:0 "Cuba for the Cubans"
CUB_cuba_for_the_cubans_desc:0 "Not content with only turning Cuba into a factory of misery, Castro the Tyrant also enjoyed exporting it to other socialist states, by offering to educate their future oppressors in our universities. But no more! President Reich has signed a decree deporting those leeches from our glorious republic effective immediately, Cuba is for Cubans and Cubans alone."
CUB_integrate_cuban_revival:0 "Integrate Cuban Revival"
CUB_integrate_cuban_revival_desc:0 "Formed out of an assortment of former resistance groups against Castroism, Cuban Revival experienced a slight but noticeable expansion in the days after our return, enough that contacts between them and the PNRC have increased in recent times. A merger would be beneficial to us both, neutralizing a potential rival on the right while also shoring up our support among sections of the most stalwart members of the exile community, ensuring the health and wellbeing of our new state."
CUB_security_in_the_american_image:0 "Security in the American Image"
CUB_security_in_the_american_image_desc:0 "Despite our tremendous success at crushing the communist threat in Cuba, many remain hidden in plain sight. But with the help of our American advisors from the FBI, we will seek to create a similar office with similar goals: fighting internal criminal groups, and protecting the state from such threats. Never again will any upstart bandit get to usurp the reins of power."

CUB_maintain_the_dictablanda_desc:0 "Despite the triumph of democracy, the fact remains that a strong hand is needed to protect it from its enemies, and safekeep the newly won freedoms and rights it brings. As a full transition away from our dictablanda would cause too much instability at the moment, keeping our iron fist in a velvet glove is the only remedy until the people come around to see the truth of matters."

Ousting the hardliners is only the beginning, the government lies in chaos due to the vacuum left in the wake of the Presidential self-coup and the remaining traitors continue sabotaging the wheels of government. There is much to be done and so little time to do it..."
CUB_batista_puppet_desc:0 "The mistakes of 1959 have been undone and now the late President Batista's son holds the seat of power, surrounded by those who see in him the best chance to restore Cuba to greatness.

CUB_reform_bureau_for_repression_of_communist_activities_desc:0 "Also known as the BRAC, the Bureau for the Repression of Communist Activities was the main arm of the former Batista administration in containing red subversion. With a new Batista in charge, a new BRAC is likewise needed to avoid another 1959 and keep the nation safe from Castroism while we entrench the new regime. Failure is not an option for us and for our president, no matter the cost."
CUB_our_own_paramilitaries:0 "Establish our own Paramilitaries"
CUB_our_own_paramilitaries_desc:0 "Ever since Castro took over Cuba, paramilitary units became a feature of Cuban society, particularly the Territorial Troops Militias created in the 80s to assist the Castroist army. While they were swiftly defeated when we returned home, according to the cabinet, the concept of such a force can be revised to create an auxiliary force loyal only to the president of the republic, which will help to keep our enemies at bay with less red tape than the military or the BRAC have."
CUB_clear_fathers_name:0 "Clear Father's Name"
CUB_clear_fathers_name_desc:0 "Decades of communist propaganda have turned our people against a great leader like President Fulgencio Batista. To begin the arduous work of showing the truth to the citizenry, the president has made it clear to the Liberty Council that he wishes to have his father reburied at Santa Ifigenia Cemetery, a place reserved for the national heroes of the republic, alongside a concerted effort to restore Fulgencio’s name to the pantheon of national heroes."

CUB_honest_american_businessmen_desc:0 "Always our backers in our long exile from Havana, American businessmen have made sure the old United States never forgot our cause, retaining their support even after the dissolution of the USA. With much of Cuba in ruins and our economy in shambles, a consortium has approached us, offering to help in reconstruction in exchange for several pro-business reforms. With the legitimate origin of these funds and the government eager for their support, there is nothing in the way of a good deal."
CUB_viva_el_presidente:0 "Viva El Presidente"
CUB_viva_el_presidente_desc:0 "As part of the restoration of the Batista dynasty to their rightful place, power needs to be centralized around the office of the presidency and the cabinet. With that goal in mind, a reorganization of the various exile groups composing the Cuban Liberty Council into the Progressive Action Party will help intertwine it with the state apparatus and ensure that our vision for Cuba can't be easily overturned by external threats."
CUB_ensure_political_loyalty:0 "Ensure Political Loyalty"
CUB_ensure_political_loyalty_desc:0 "While the PAP is our tool to retain power, the domestic opposition to Castoism cannot be left overlooked for too long. With our efforts to pacify Cuba ongoing, integrating them into our political system will ensure that they play the game by our rules instead of turning into another bunch of partisans to defeat. Despite the political differences between us, President Batista insists on meeting with their leaders to showcase his goodwill, despite the remote chance for a productive outcome."
CUB_grease_the_wheels:0 "Grease the Wheels"
CUB_grease_the_wheels_desc:0 "Political work is incredibly taxing for those who shoulder the weight of an entire nation. To help ensure that the gears of democracy never stop moving, some palms need some greasing to move things along. As the Liberty Council works toward establishing some beneficiary networks, some questions arise whether the President should know what we do to help him reign over a nation that still struggles to walk to freedom."
CUB_a_social_democracy:0 "A Social Democracy"
CUB_a_social_democracy_desc:0 "As President Batista has lived in Europe most of his life, his political philosophy has been greatly influenced by the traditions of the social democrats, including their alignment with social welfare and social reform. While some of that agenda is close to the old order, its implementation - to a reasonable extent - is a necessary sacrifice to ensure that the population accepts our rule."
CUB_restore_republican_stability:0 "Restore Republican Stability"
CUB_restore_republican_stability_desc:0 "With the President and the Liberty Council now firmly under control, the Council has agreed with the President to lift the declaration of martial law, finally withdrawing the military back to their barracks.

CUB_restore_civic_military_institutes_desc:0 "Born in the decade of 1930, the Civic-Military Institutes originally fought illiteracy in Cuba. Though the Castro regime did manage to bring an end to the issue, this modern iteration of the program, organized and pushed through Congress at the initiative of President Batista, will instead boost education access for the rural population, helping ensure that every citizen of our republic has access to the necessary tools to be successful and productive."

CUB_loyal_cadre_of_sergeants_desc:0 "While refilling the rank-and-file of our new Constitutional Army has been a simple task, it is abundantly clear to the government that the foundation of our renewed armed forces must be the NCOs. Educated enough to maintain the broad perspective of both war and peace, and still enough in touch with the soldiery to not forget their patriotic oaths, history has proven that the NCO corps has always provided the best and the brightest of Cuban soldiers."
CUB_restore_order_to_countryside:0 "Restore Order to the Countryside"
CUB_restore_order_to_countryside_desc:0 "In the days since the defeat of the FAR terrorists, the countryside remains plagued by Castroist partisans, hindering our plans. But now we have them cornered, and with one last fell stroke by the BRAC and the armed forces, our rule over the island will be absolute at last, making the country safe and eradicating the vestiges of communist resistance to the new order. Ten thousand years of peace begins today."
CUB_military_autarky:0 "Establish Military Autarky"
CUB_military_autarky_desc:0 "Despite our close relationship with Atlanta, some fears inside our government have arisen on what would happen should the lifeline of our armed forces be cut. Investing in some domestic production would ensure that our army can stand on its own two feet, should we ever have to fight without our American allies having our backs, preventing a future arms embargo from getting in our way."
CUB_strengthen_our_business_ties:0 "Strengthen our Business Ties"
CUB_strengthen_our_business_ties_desc:0 "After the Castroist coup, foreign corporations were expelled and their properties were seized. Returning the assets under our control to the rightful owners is only logical for a market economy, and is especially necessary to be able to fund the President's ambitious welfare agenda - despite his fears of the effects such a move would have for our sovereignty."
CUB_return_the_plantations:0 "Return the Plantations"
CUB_return_the_plantations_desc:0 "One of the biggest injustices done during the tyranny of the Castro brothers saw many farms expropriated and administered by the state. With the regime undone after decades of work, it is time to return the farms to those who were unjustly stripped of them in 1959 and let them once more dispose of their properties as they please, to revitalize our rural economy."
CUB_restore_our_industrious_spirit:0 "Restore our Industrious Spirit"
CUB_restore_our_industrious_spirit_desc:0 "Out of the many woes the PCC inflicted upon our society, the sloth they delivered upon the people may as well rank at the top of the list, smothering the spirit of progress and entrepreneurship that Cuba once embraced. Reducing red tape, embracing foreign investment, and granting favorable terms for our industries will go a long way to bringing prosperity back to the isle."
CUB_second_havana_conference:0 "The Second Havana Conference"
CUB_second_havana_conference_desc:0 "A meeting between several of our American backers will happen at the Hotel Nacional, as has happened once before. The goal of the conference is to deepen the involvement of our benefactors in the Cuban economy, benefiting everyone involved with greater trade and foreign investment, the Liberty Council in particular."
CUB_support_patriotic_trade_unions:0 "Support Patriotic Trade Unions"
CUB_support_patriotic_trade_unions_desc:0 "While heavily involved with Castro, not all of Cuba's trade unions have been corrupted by communism. Some workers have organized around Christian syndicates and other noncommunist trade unions. By supporting them we can help to undermine those loyal to the now illegal CTC, by offering an alternative option by which to complain in a lawful, and controllable, manner."
CUB_viva_la_habana:0 "Viva La Habana!"
CUB_viva_la_habana_desc:0 "The liberation of Havana left the city with minor damages. With reconstruction providing the chance to do some badly needed urban renewal programs, the Capital can become a shining star of the Caribbean once more. With these efforts, prosperity is sure to flood into the city over the protestations of the poor, crying of gentrification. With such promises just around the corner, the president is eager to sign off on new projects to revitalize more of the city."
CUB_justice_for_1959:0 "Justice for 1959 Exacted"
CUB_justice_for_1959_desc:0 "Finally, it has been done. Father's legacy has been avenged at last, and Cuba has returned to the path that it shouldn't have been led away from by that band of red thugs and bandits. But despite liberating Cuba and delivering freedom and social democracy to the people, helping secure a booming economy, why does it feel like something has gone wrong along the way?"
CUB_el_cabro_takes_control:0 "El Cabro Takes Control"
CUB_el_cabro_takes_control_desc:0 "God has willed it. Despite the seemingly insurmountable obstacles in his way, from godless communists to the crypto-atheist provisional government, to the miniscule presence of Protestantism in Cuba, Rafael Cruz has defied the odds time and time again, baffling the world in the process, and now stands as the self-proclaimed shepherd of the Cuban people. With barely any support beyond the Army of the Lord and a handful of devout anti-communists, we must act quickly if the word of God is to take root."
CUB_tear_down_symbols_of_atheism:0 "Tear Down Symbols of Atheism"
CUB_tear_down_symbols_of_atheism_desc:0 "During the dark times of Castro's sinful rule, almost every citizen of Cuba fell to the spell of atheism and turned their back on God, statues were raised to the unholy leaders of the PCC, and unjust laws allowed this state of affairs to fester. As Cruz and the Army of the Lord continue their relentless efforts to save Cuba from itself, these symbols of evil must be destroyed and their followers must be punished, if the few seeds sown by Supreme Leader Cruz are to flourish in such hostile terrain."
CUB_put_god_back_in_government:0 "Put God Back in Government"
CUB_put_god_back_in_government_desc:0 "Despite the valiant efforts of the Army of the Lord, the fact remains that warriors alone cannot rule over twelve million misguided souls. The solidification of our authority requires that a measure of civilian rule be implemented. By putting godly men sympathetic to our cause into power and ensuring that the government operates according to the word of God, we can begin to heal Cuba from the scars of civil war and faithlessness."
CUB_establish_ties_with_latin_evangelicals:0 "Establish Ties with Latin Evangelicals"
CUB_establish_ties_with_latin_evangelicals_desc:0 "Despite being present ever since the 1880s, it was only around the 1980s that the peoples of Latin America began to see the light of the Lord in large enough numbers. Despite the decades of missionary work, they remain disorganized and short on resources, but using our miraculously newfound position in Cuba we can begin to change that and help our fellow Evangelicals in the region, nurturing the seed of the true church."
CUB_marginalise_the_papists:0 "Marginalize the Papists"
CUB_marginalise_the_papists_desc:0 "Despite allegedly worshipping the same God as us, the worshippers of Mary and the Idols are not our brothers in the faith. Only we can lead the faithful Cubans away from eternal damnation. Enshrining our sole leadership role over the communities of the faithful will ensure that our pastors have a privileged position to chip away at the power of the Catholic Church and their hold over the overwhelming majority of the population."
CUB_return_of_religious_schools:0 "The Return of Religious Schools"
CUB_return_of_religious_schools_desc:0 "Ever since 1959 until our glorious and unexpected return, religious education was completely marginalized, denying the young schooling about God and how to live a proper Christian lifestyle. Undoing decades of atheistic indoctrination will take years, if not decades, but the next generation must be allowed to grow up free of the red taint, regardless of what their misguided parents may want."
CUB_ecumenical_cuba:0 "An Ecumenical Cuba"
CUB_ecumenical_cuba_desc:0 "Despite the Lord blessing our path to victory, we cannot rule while actively antagonizing the Papist majority of the island. With that in mind, Supreme Leader Cruz has seen fit to meet their leadership to try and reach an accommodation with them. Although their church is misguided, there are too many of them to suppress it outright. Instead, a policy of toleration will ensure tranquility in the streets and the Catholic Church's neutrality towards our righteous policies."
CUB_establish_council_of_pastors:0 "Establish the Council of Pastors"
CUB_establish_council_of_pastors_desc:0 "Envisioned as a control organism composed of twelve priests and theologians, the Council of Pastors entrusted with legislative and judicial powers to ensure that all legislation is compatible with both the Constitution and the word of God. Such an institution will help entrench the power of Christ in Cuba, as only the wisest men will be anointed by the Supreme Leader for such an important position."
CUB_family_as_god_intended_it:0 "Family as God Intended It"
CUB_family_as_god_intended_it_desc:0 "Under the communist tyrants, the holy institution of the family was perverted into including unnaturalities such as concubinage or sodomy. With the implementation of proper Christian rule over Cuba, we can overturn such a satanic policy and enforce the appropriate structure for a family, a man and a woman united in a holy marriage under God, all while broadening our support with traditionalist elements of society."
CUB_commander_of_the_faithful:0 "Commander of the Faithful"
CUB_commander_of_the_faithful_desc:0 "As our great commander and liberator, Supreme Leader Cruz has bestowed grace and godly governance over the republic, saving it and its people from the clutches of the unfaithful. Enshrining the role he played in history will go a long way to replace the old Castro cult with that of a Christian comandante, whose word is the law of the Lord, whose faith moves mountains, and whose followers fill every position in government, ensuring that God's and Cruz's will are done in every corner of Cuba."
CUB_raise_army_of_the_faithful:0 "Raise an Army of the Faithful"
CUB_raise_army_of_the_faithful_desc:0 "Having overthrown the crypto-atheists in the government, we find ourselves having to rebuild the nation's military capabilities and with few allies to entrust with such a task. Fortunately, the Army of the Lord provides a great core for the new Cuban army, which will stand guard against the Lord's enemies. As 1 Peter 5:8 says ‘Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour’. The danger faced by the faithful cannot be considered anything less."
CUB_clear_dens_of_communism:0 "Clear Dens of Communism"
CUB_clear_dens_of_communism_desc:0 "Despite the defeat of their impious vanguard, many communist bandits still lurk in the shadows, undermining the work of God. Operation Salvaguardia, following months of careful planning, will exorcise the red plague that has taken root so deeply. With their blood, the seeds of faith will blossom across the many hearts of the republic and the few will become the many."
CUB_endorse_christian_charity:0 "Endorse Christian Charity"
CUB_endorse_christian_charity_desc:0 "One of the seven capital virtues, Caritas, upholds generosity and the spirit of giving as a key aspect of Christian love. By endorsing and promoting charitable organisations, we will be able to spread the fruits of joy, peace, and mercy across the country and showcase its many citizens not only the love of their fellow man but of God as well, while helping to induct more Cubans into the one true faith."
CUB_master_of_all_life:0 "The Master of All Life"
CUB_master_of_all_life_desc:0 "Many have seemingly forgotten God's promises about the Earth and its position relative to men, setting aside areas for so-called preservation, instead of utilizing them for mankind's benefit as He intended. By opening up those areas for economic development by both local and foreign corporations, we can begin to yet again take Christian stewardship over the country and its natural resources, no matter what some tree-hugging communists say."
CUB_endorse_healthcare_sharing_ministries:0 "Endorse Healthcare Sharing Ministries"
CUB_endorse_healthcare_sharing_ministries_desc:0 "A Christian alternative to traditional health insurance, these ministries involve a group of people sharing healthcare costs by monthly contributions while keeping freedom of choice regarding providers, keeping healthcare a private matter. By endorsing them, the Supreme Leader hopes to expand their influence across Cuba and expand our religious influence over the traditionally Catholic population through the furtherance of private healthcare."
CUB_doctrine_of_prosperity:0 "The Doctrine of Prosperity"
CUB_doctrine_of_prosperity_desc:0 "Based upon the truth that God rewards good deeds and faith with material rewards, such a doctrine will help undo decades of communist laziness imprinted on the Cuban people and drive them to work harder and showcase their love of His word with their newfound rewards, like being freed from poverty or illness, for He wants his flock to be happy and prosperous and he only demands fealty in exchange."
CUB_virtue_of_industriousness:0 "The Virtue of Industriousness"
CUB_virtue_of_industriousness_desc:0 "Sloth has corrupted Cuban society in the years following Castro's takeover, with so called ‘workers' rights’ sapping the moral virtue of the workers and denying those with entrepreneurial spirit to enrich their spirits and bodies with the maximum possible wealth. While this sin has swallowed the nation, decisive action from the Supreme Leader can undo the damage done, and despite their protestations, the people in time will see that this policy is for their own material and spiritual wellbeing."
CUB_support_evangelical_foundations:0 "Support Evangelical Foundations"
CUB_support_evangelical_foundations_desc:0 "Despite the guidance of the invisible hand of God, the economy has yet to finish the transition away from the old command economy of the Castroist regime. Finding an innovative and Christian solution to the issue, Supreme Leader Cruz has decided to distribute the remaining state property to several charitable foundations entrusted with entire sectors of the economy. To facilitate the distribution of alms and charity to the people, they will enjoy a tax-exempt status similar to that of a church, spreading the good word with a minimum of waste."
CUB_capitalism_with_christian_characteristics:0 "Capitalism with Christian Characteristics"
CUB_capitalism_with_christian_characteristics_desc:0 "Our work has finally paid dividends and the Cuban economy operates in a way friendly to His word and His commandments to be fruitful and multiply. With economic reforms completed, the Supreme Leader can now humbly announce that the Word of God leads the nation on the path of wealth and prosperity, with an industrious and hardworking people to keep their part of the holy covenant."
CUB_jerusalem_of_the_caribbean:0 "The Jerusalem of the Caribbean"
CUB_jerusalem_of_the_caribbean_desc:0 "It is finished. In only a few short years, Supreme Leader Cruz has baffled everyone who thought His movement would become a mere footnote in history. Today, the Christian Republic of Cuba now stands as a redeemed nation, a beacon of godly government in a world that rejects His guidance, a model for those who seek to save Latin America from atheism and secularism, and for Supreme Leader Rafael Cruz, a testament of his relentless work in the name of God."
CUB_how_beautiful_is_cuba:0 "How Beautiful is Cuba"
CUB_how_beautiful_is_cuba_desc:0 "While some politicians inside the government have proposed to embark on a heavy industrialization program, the environmental risks to our island are too large to support such a plan. Instead of being a Caribbean Albania clouded with smog, the Cuban economy should instead exploit its natural advantages: our paradisiac beaches and our seas. What we will lose of economic independence, we will more than gain in prosperity that won't sacrifice our environment."
CUB_varadero_of_the_oriente:0 "The Varadero of the Oriente"
CUB_varadero_of_the_oriente_desc:0 "In the west, one of the world's most beautiful beaches can be found in the town of Vaderero, a shining star of Cuban tourism. As plans to develop said sector unfold, proposals to create a second Varadero on the eastern side of the country will only bring even more tourism to Cuba and benefit the locals with expanded public infrastructure."
CUB_a_coastline_of_resorts:0 "A Coastline of Resorts"
CUB_a_coastline_of_resorts_desc:0 "As the expansion of the tourism industry continues, plans have been proposed to locate resorts on the most visited beaches of the isle. Beyond the resorts themselves, these investments will create a large consumer goods industry meant to feed both our people and the tourists visiting the new resorts, enriching the country further and further."
CUB_revolutionary_soda:0 "A Revolutionary Soda"
CUB_revolutionary_soda_desc:0 "TuKola, long the domestic cola of choice, has become a staple, but many in the government see the opportunity to make it the dominant soft drink in Latin America. With the implementation of trade deals across the region, TuKola will be sold in north and south, and at last fill the void left by the collapse of the Yanqui soda industry."
CUB_expand_national_parks:0 "Expand National Parks"
CUB_expand_national_parks_desc:0 "With already 14 national parks covering a wide variety of climates and terrains from east to west, these have become popular destinations for tourists, allowing us to economically protect the island's biodiversity. Expanding the number of parks will ensure that more of the island's natural beauty is preserved, though it will also slow down economic development as the amount of available land is reduced."
CUB_modernise_juragua_nuclear_plant:0 "Modernise the Juraguá Nuclear Power Plant"
CUB_modernise_juragua_nuclear_plant_desc:0 "Completed in the 90s with Soviet assistance, the Juragua Nuclear Power Plant has become the keystone of our energy grid, easing our reliance on fossil fuels. The plant is however beginning to show signs of age and a handful of design flaws have become apparent, so to protect such a critical asset and secure our energy independence for the foreseeable future, the plant will be modernized and expanded, allowing this pride of the Cuban nation to shine for decades to come."
CUB_support_consumer_industries:0 "Support Consumer Industries"
CUB_support_consumer_industries_desc:0 "Regardless of anything else, consumer goods are essential to a modern society, and given our position as an island nation and with the memory of the Yankee blockade fresh in our memories, ensuring that we have a reliable and - most importantly - domestic source of consumer goods will not only create jobs but also diversify our economy."
CUB_vacation_paradise_once_more:0 "A Vacation Paradise Once More"
CUB_vacation_paradise_once_more_desc:0 "With the investments already beginning to pay off, we are seeing a number of tourists beyond our wildest expectations, with Cuba becoming the tourist destination of choice for people all over the globe. As we wipe the sweat off our brows and do our best to make our guests’ stays as pleasant as possible, we can be confident that we have secured a strong foundation for our future national development."
CUB_extend_railway_coverage:0 "Extend Railway Coverage"
CUB_extend_railway_coverage_desc:0 "While the Cuban railway network is hardly irrelevant, the fact is that it could be much larger, while most of our rolling stock is composed of Soviet hand-me-downs, both factors contributing to slowing down our economic potential. As we continue to expand our economic capabilities, both aspects will need to be addressed in order to unlock the true capabilities of the Cuban economy, and only a modernized railway network can be the solution we’re looking for."
CUB_expand_oil_rigs:0 "Expand Offshore Oil Rigs"
CUB_expand_oil_rigs_desc:0 "While offshore rigs are already being operated near Varadero, reports from exploration vessels show that there is room for a large expansion of our operations. The benefits are all too clear, letting us lower domestic prices and increase export profits, while making us less reliant on an unpredictable world for our fuel needs."
CUB_transition_to_industrial_society:0 "Transition to an Industrial Society"
CUB_transition_to_industrial_society_desc:0 "Being a traditionally agrarian and services focused economy, Cuba has lacked a strong industrial sector, instead relying on imports from friendly states. With the world changing around us, a plan drafted by the Ministry of Industry has finally found the ear of the cabinet, and with our well educated workforce, we can ensure that industry will spring up all over Cuba like mushrooms after a warm rain."
CUB_nickel_processing_plants:0 "Construct Nickel Processing Plants"
CUB_nickel_processing_plants_desc:0 "Holding one of the world's largest nickel reserves, it has been lucrative to export the raw material abroad by itself, but as we make strides towards industrialization, such a model is no longer sufficient for us. Instead, by ensuring that our industries have access to refined nickel, we can both strengthen the growth of heavy industry and reap increased export profits."
CUB_weld_a_domestic_steel_industry:0 "Weld a Domestic Steel Industry"
CUB_weld_a_domestic_steel_industry_desc:0 "While we have a modestly strong steel industry, with enterprises such as the Jose Marti Steel Company ensuring that we can mostly rely on local supply for our needs, production levels are still well below their optimal capacity. By expanding our existing factories and constructing new ones, we will be able to multiply our production levels several times over, ensuring that we can not just be self-sufficient but also export our steel surplus."
CUB_utilise_our_skilled_workforce:0 "Utilize our Skilled Workforce"
CUB_utilise_our_skilled_workforce_desc:0 "One of the benefits of the education policy of the 20th century is that Cuba hosts a sizable percentage of people with tertiary education, skills which can now come in handy as demand for skilled labour grows. Putting those degrees to good use will ensure there is no lack of professionals for our newly open positions, and that our economy remains competitive with world leaders despite its smaller size."
CUB_made_in_cuba:0 "Made in Cuba"
CUB_made_in_cuba_desc:0 "With our secondary sector increasingly well established, it has drawn attention from foreign investors and buyers, with talks of a ‘Caribbean Tiger’ growing commonplace in the economic press. Using this newfound interest in our products, it would be wise to lean into the brand, showcasing our quality to the world and making Cuban production a mark of fine handicraft all of its own."
CUB_workshop_of_the_caribbean:0 "Workshop of the Caribbean"
CUB_workshop_of_the_caribbean_desc:0 "Despite the high price of industrial investments and the shifts needed to accommodate the societal changes brought forth by our efforts, the benefits have proven to be well worth it. As Cuba has entered the 21st century, the primary sector is finally relegated to second place of importance behind our rapidly growing industries, the Cuban tiger has awoken and is ready to roar."
CUB_sustaining_a_modern_society:0 "Sustaining a Modern Society"
CUB_sustaining_a_modern_society_desc:0 "Historically an under-mechanized sector, Cuban agriculture has been lacking in tractors and other modern tools, keeping farming labor intense and strenuous. Increasing the productivity and efficiency of our farmers will require modern equipment and the modernization of farm practices will ensure that we can not only produce more food for our people, but ease the lives of our campesinos, and clear up additional workforce for our economic modernization program."
CUB_revenge_for_the_embargo:0 "Revenge for the Embargo"
CUB_revenge_for_the_embargo_desc:0 "The Yanquis never forgave us for breaking free from their yoke. Even with their nation in ruins, they continue their nonsensical crusade against our revolution. Soon enough, when what remains of their economy is but smoldering ruins, they will know what thirst, hunger, and pain truly feel like."
CUB_revenge_for_the_attacks:0 "Revenge for the Attacks"
CUB_revenge_for_the_attacks_desc:0 "All those bombs, all those bullets, and all those innocents who paid with their lives. The Yanqui regime is responsible for every single one of them, and will pay for all the blood they have spilled. As our army sweeps across the wasteland they call home, they will exact the justice our nation has long sought."

CUB_revenge_for_the_coup_desc:0 "The Coup of 1952, back when the Yanqui dogs and their mafioso partners decided our pittances of independence were still too much for them, left deep wounds in our nation. Only through the tireless efforts of the revolutionaries were these healed, and now we will have our revenge. Those guilty, and their associates, will be tracked down by the Black Wasps, one by one."
CUB_revenge_for_the_occupation:0 "Revenge for the Occupation"
CUB_revenge_for_the_occupation_desc:0 "Back when our ancestors fought against the Spaniards, our northern neighbour smelled blood and stole our country from under us. Leaving our homeland as just another puppet state, they kept us in the bondage of colonial rule for many more decades. Such a humiliation cannot be forgiven nor forgotten, and for this we shall immolate their agents of imperialism."

CUB_an_eye_for_an_eye_desc:0 "At the end of the day, we know that if we seem to waver in our quest, the Remnants shall eventually be in a position to strike back. This cannot be allowed. Only with a thorough and complete exactment of justice can we impart our lesson upon them: That the sovereignty of the Cuban nation is inviolable, and that we are willing to follow those who nevertheless attempt to subdue us to the ends of the world."

CUB_turn_it_over_to_uapr_desc:0 "Now that the last vestiges of American imperialism are naught but irradiated rubble, we have nothing more to do in that condemned land. Its people have been subdued and the regime will never again threaten us. As the land has no further utility to us, let us turn it over to our American allies, so they may rebuild something worthy of calling itself American."
CUB_establish_permanent_occupational_authority:0 "Establish a Permanent Occupational Authority"
CUB_establish_permanent_occupational_authority_desc:0 "It is abundantly clear that the American South will always harbor reactionary and imperial sentiments, making the region a perpetual threat towards our independence. The Cuban people have already suffered greatly at their hands, so we must ensure they never threaten us again. No one else can be trusted with this responsibility, it is up to us and us alone."
CUB_become_the_maximum_leader:0 "Become the Maximum Leader"
CUB_become_the_maximum_leader_desc:0 "Operación Venganza proved that only with strong leadership can the revolution prevail against those who would seek to destroy it. Though Compañero Fidel was long reluctant to take on an unquestionably central role in the Cuban Revolution, rejecting dictatorship, it is now clear that there is no alternative. Only with the uncontested, undisputed vision of El Líder Máximo can we find the security the Revolution needs in this hostile world."

CUB_bolster_the_revolutionary_armed_forces_desc:0 "With the wretches of the world having turned against us after our just retribution, it has become clear to us that Cuba's only real friend is the FAR.

CUB_prepare_for_autosuficiencia:0 "Prepare for Autosuficiencia"
CUB_prepare_for_autosuficiencia_desc:0 "Unfortunately, our erstwhile, spineless allies have turned against us, renouncing us for barbarism and alleged crimes against humanity, Rendering our country a pariah, and imposing sanctions only equalled by the Blockade upon us.

CUB_strengthen_collective_revolutionary_vigilance_desc:0 "The complacency of our security apparatus was on full display during the terrorist crisis.

CUB_ensure_total_revolutionary_unity:0 "Ensure Total Revolutionary Unity"
CUB_ensure_total_revolutionary_unity_desc:0 "There has always been citizens of Cuba who did not understand our actions, who have opposed them.

CUB_reinstate_ideological_incentives:0 "Reinstate Ideological Incentives"
CUB_reinstate_ideological_incentives_desc:0 "As we withdraw further into isolation, money has become less and less necessary as external inputs are reduced to near zero, making monetary incentives increasingly redundant. Ideological incentives, however, do not have such constraints. Reinstating their use will ensure that productivity doesn't suffer from the consequences of the collapse of our international trade."
CUB_pursue_import_substitution:0 "Pursue Import Substitution"
CUB_pursue_import_substitution_desc:0 "Finding ourselves short of lots of products and machinery that we used to import means that we must learn to produce everything we need to run our economy at home.

CUB_geared_for_autarky_desc:0 "We have done everything possible to prepare Cuba for autosuficiencia. With everything from foodstuffs to heavy machinery now being produced at home, the only thing that remains is to formally close ourselves to the world by announcing that nothing and no one will enter Cuba, that we need no one."
CUB_hasta_la_victoria_final:0 "Hasta la Victoria Final"
CUB_hasta_la_victoria_final_desc:0 "El Lider Maximo now stands as a giant above his people and his nation, he who has protected Cuba and his people from harm and exploitation. There remains only one thing left before we can proclaim our final victory against imperialism: the development of our own nuclear arsenal, the final guarantee of independence and sovereignty. Though surrounded by enemies, they will never again be able to touch us, now and forevermore."
CUB_stabilise_our_social_democracy:0 "Stabilize our Social Democracy"
CUB_stabilise_our_social_democracy_desc:0 "As our government continues to struggle with the chaos caused by the arrests of every member of the former cabinet and the purges in the administration, President Batista has found himself needing allies quickly, least should the nation fall to chaos. The Christian Democratic Party, composed of the more liberal-minded exiles and whose platform of christian social justice is close enough to the President's that they would make good allies to fill some of the gaps in our new administration, should we only invite them."
CUB_end_corporate_stranglehold:0 "End the Corporate Stranglehold"
CUB_end_corporate_stranglehold_desc:0 "Enabled by, and being part of, the corrupt cabal that tried to run the government behind the President's back, numerous foreign corporations have grown extremely powerful inside our country. As the effort to rescue Cuba from the situation continues, the laws passed need to be repealed and a new legal framework to check corporate power needs to be put in place, capitalist greed may never lead to another Castro."
CUB_expel_the_american_mobsters:0 "Expel the American Mobsters"
CUB_expel_the_american_mobsters_desc:0 "The ‘Businessmen’ that the wannabe handlers of the Liberty Council tried to sneak under President Batista's nose were just criminals, barely any different than those that used to run the country before 1959. Having quietly worked to collect evidence, President Batista will now get rid of that plague in one swift stroke, tearing up their organizations by the roots, and bringing an end to the rut they’re spreading throughout society."
CUB_liberalise_the_trade_union_laws:0 "Liberalize the Trade Union Laws"
CUB_liberalise_the_trade_union_laws_desc:0 "With reforms well underway to cleanse Cuba from the misrule of the Exile hardliners, the banned trade unions have been demanding that the repressive laws regarding unions be repealed, something that the President has been all too eager to agree with all in the name of delivering a free and fair society. Social democracy demands an unrestrained labor market."
CUB_conduct_just_land_reform:0 "Conduct a Just Land Reform"
CUB_conduct_just_land_reform_desc:0 "The best example of the blatantly corrupt policies of the bygone administration, the alleged land reforms after their conquest of Cuba practically saw a return to 1958, restoring the latifundias. Despite the still ongoing disorganization in our bureaucracy, undoing such a catastrophic policy has become a priority, it is of utmost importance that we after all these many decades finally put the farms in the hands of the farmers and nobody but the farmers."
CUB_abolish_the_repressive_regime:0 "Abolish the Repressive Regime"
CUB_abolish_the_repressive_regime_desc:0 "While BRAC has been behind most of the atrocities during the "pacification" campaigns, they are merely the face of the machine of violence deployed against dissidents and those opposing injustice. The entire apparatus must be torn down, from laws regarding the right of assembly and freedom of speech to the size of the security services. The new Cuba does not need to suppress the popular will, democracy and freedom cannot prosper in the darkness."
CUB_make_room_for_the_communists:0 "Make Room for the Communists"
CUB_make_room_for_the_communists_desc:0 "Perhaps the most controversial policy ever proposed by President Roberto Batista, pardoning the remaining communist rebels and even inviting them back to political life has made even the most liberal figures nervous about the potential of revenge by the PCC, given the brutality they have been treated. Regardless, it is a necessary risk to take if the nation is to finally heal from its traumatic history."
CUB_put_the_puppet_masters_on_trial:0 "Try the 'Puppet Masters'"
CUB_put_the_puppet_masters_on_trial_desc:0 "At last, the final part of Roberto Batista's work is at hand, the trial and sentencing of most of the Radical Republican faction, from his Cabinet to their key backers in the civil service and the business community. With the president insisting on the harshest sentences possible, Batista hopes to close the darkest chapter of his life and move on to a Cuba cleansed of the PAP henchmen where the people may flourish at long last."
CUB_further_our_welfare_guarantees:0 "Further our Welfare Guarantees"
CUB_further_our_welfare_guarantees_desc:0 "While the president's insistence managed to save most of the welfare state, many provisions were either cut or privatized by the former regime. Restoring them will not only improve the president's approval rate but also the quality of life of the average citizen, helping to tackle the problems caused by a radical market transition and bring forth a more equal society, ensuring every citizen can have a decent life from the cradle to the grave."
CUB_the_family_name_redeemed:0 "The Family Name Redeemed"
CUB_the_family_name_redeemed_desc:0 "Finally, it has been done, democracy is firmly entrenched, and the sins of the father have been cleansed away, and a new era of peace and real freedom has been inaugurated. President Batista can finally reflect on his work with renewed pride, feeling confident that he has done the right thing not only for the republic and the people, but for himself and his family. \n\n¡Larga vida al Presidente!"

idea_CUB_underindustrialised_economy:0 "Underindustrialised Economy"
idea_CUB_underindustrialised_economy_desc:0 "For centuries, the foundation of Cuba's economy has been cash crops such as sugar and tobacco, one of the few things that have not changed since the revolution. Thanks to lucrative trade relations with the Warsaw Pact, the government has seen little reason to carry out more than slight industrialisation, making the country reliant on imports for many of its more modern needs. This has, however, also given Cuba plenty of unspoilt nature, making it an attractive tourist destination. Nevertheless, Cuba cannot remain an agrarian economy forever, and many are beginning to see that some form of economic transition may be necessary sooner rather than later."
idea_CUB_the_peoples_partner:0 "The People's Partner"
idea_CUB_the_peoples_partner_desc:0 "Formed out of the revolutionary bands that overthrew Fulgencio Batista, the Revolutionary Armed Forces have grown to become one of the pillars of the Cuban state. Famed for their interventions in Angola and Central America, The Revolutionary Armed Forces have become a reputable fighting force, the sword and shield of international socialism. This policy has, however, come to a close following Raul Castro's ascent to power, who has withdrawn the military home to Cuba. This has left the force idle, and it has spent the time beating its swords into ploughshares, taking an important role in continued economic development, especially in younger sectors with the assent of its commander-in-chief, Raul Castro. Now, it is estimated that six percent of the Cuban economy is controlled by military holding companies such as the Grupo de Administración Empresarial S.A., a number that is only likely to increase as long as the government follows its current course."
idea_CUB_the_cuban_model:0 "The Cuban Model"
idea_CUB_the_cuban_model_desc:0 "The pride and joy of the Cuban people, the welfare state constructed under Fidel Castro has led to an hitherto unparalleled level of security for the common people. Already showing results during the Blockade, the Cuban Model has only expanded since the end of the Blockade in 1987, now offering world-class healthcare and education to the twelve million people who call Cuba home. All of this has brought widespread support to the Communist Party of Cuba from the broad elements of society, especially among the formerly impoverished campesinos of the Oriente. Despite the growing calls for political liberalisation, the one thing that everyone agrees on is that the Cuban Model has come to stay."
