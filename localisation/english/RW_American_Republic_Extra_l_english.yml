### Focuses ###

USA_the_legitimate_government:0 "The Legitimate Government"
USA_the_legitimate_government_desc:0 "Long United Must Divide. Long Divided Must Unite. The Former United States is languishing under decades of division. As the legal inheritors of the mantle of the United States following Reagan's abdication of the office, the American Republic is the sole legitimate Government to the entirety of the United States. The time has come to prove it. No more sitting on our asses. All the President's Horses and all the President's men, are going to put America back together again."

USA_president_rumsfeld:0 "President Rumsfeld's Agenda"
USA_president_rumsfeld_desc:0 "With the main issues of the day sorted, President Rumsfeld can at last get to implementing his agenda as President of the American Republic. A cooperative Congress has ensured easy passage of the President's policies, all while GOP loyalty slowly returns following Jeb's attempts to divide the Party. The State of the Union is Strong. The time has come to get to work repairing America."
USA_secure_gop_loyalty:0 "Secure GOP Loyalty"
USA_secure_gop_loyalty_desc:0 "That wiley pissant little daddy’s boy bastard spawn of President Bush has finally had his little 'Rebellion' stomped out with extreme prejudice. Try as he may to throw a spanner into the works we have beat back that whiny little cocksucker and all his 'Bush Loyalist' Ivy League friends. Now is the time to clear out the GOP of its cobwebs, kick 'Jeb' to the curb and sweep the Bush Dynasty into the dustbin of history where it belongs."
USA_limbaugh_on_the_radio:0 "Limbaugh on the Airwaves"
USA_limbaugh_on_the_radio_desc:0 "Humming along on the radio sets of every car in the Republic is the piercing voice of one man: RUSH LIMBAUGH. This renowned Disc Jockey has defined modern Conservatism, delivering to the people the facts from a Republican perspective. The man is a natural echo chamber, an uncompromising voice for Conservative values. We ought to use this man to spread President Rumsfeld's agenda."
USA_expand_media_empire:0 "Expand the Republican Media Empire"
USA_expand_media_empire_desc:0 "Fox News has been blaring on the Teleset of every loyal Republican household from Norfolk to Baton Rouge ever since the network was first founded by noted British expat Rupert Murdoch. The near unbreakable grip of the GOP on the South's media apparatus is a part of why our party has enjoyed such constant electoral success - but the prevalence of Fox News alone isn't enough anymore. We need to get the FCC to work rooting out Communist media like CNN, brainchild of noted Castro devotee Ted Turner."
USA_reach_out_to_the_christian_right:0 "Our Friends in the Christian Right"
USA_reach_out_to_the_christian_right_desc:0 "If there's one thing the South loves more than fornicating with their cousins and enjoying their nanna's Peach Cobbler, it's God. While Reagan has been discredited, and rightfully so, the influence of his abortive Presidency on the Evangelical Right still continues on to this day. Much to the chagrin of Liberal Republicans, President Rumsfeld has moved to shore up his credentials with the Christian Right, ensuring the interpretation of 'Southern Values' remains to God's liking, and that insidious forces such as Homosexuality and Abortion are not allowed to spread like the Kudzu vines that are slowly but surely strangling our Dixie."
USA_vision_of_coe:0 "The Vision of Coe and LaHaye"
USA_vision_of_coe_desc:0 "Under the Cross lies the reborn American Republic, emerging from the rot with a newfound moral code, thanks to our friends in the Evangelical right. The South is God's country, and those who seek to deny the power of the almighty have no place in our Jesus-loving society. Only the most God-fearing Red-Blooded Americans shall be granted a seat at the table, as President Rumsfeld gives carte blanche to figures such as Douglas Coe and Tim LaHaye in exchange for God's support for President Rumsfeld's righteous Crusade to free the world of Wicked Communism."
USA_defenders_of_christian_faith:0 "Under His Eye"
USA_defenders_of_christian_faith_desc:0 "God, Freedom, and Country are all back in vogue here in the American Republic. Rumsfeld, himself seemingly ambivalent to the Evangelical cause, is now relying more and more heavily on the undercurrent of Fundamentalist support growing within the GOP. Under the immutable rule of Christian Values, we shall seek to create a new United States, with laws and principles fundamentally based on God's Ten Commandments. While some have been so rude as to call this new America a 'Theocracy', the GOP is committed solely to the values and principles that make the South the beacon of morality that continues to shine against Communist degeneracy."
USA_big_buisnes_loyalty:0 "A Commitment to Capitalism"
USA_big_buisnes_loyalty_desc:0 "While we worship the almighty, there is another force that beacons to us from beyond the ether: Capitalism. If we are to beat the Communists, then we must embrace our Capitalist roots, worshiping the twin GOP deities of Capitalism and the Christian God, and undo the dangerous anti-Free Market reforms implemented during the Bush years. Our road to salvation is paved with the almighty dollar."
USA_extreme_deregulation:0 "Extensive Deregulation"
USA_extreme_deregulation_desc:0 "The business class has been put into a chokehold by the burdens of overregulation. Rumsfeld's agenda shall be one of breaking with the late President's policies of Dirigisme in an effort to force Businesses to stay in the South instead of relocating to Canada - something which has had the opposite effect, instead driving Businesses North. Rumsfeld's abolition of these policies, combined with an across-the-board cut in the minimum wage, shall help communicate that we mean Business." 
USA_keeping_big_oil_loyal:0 "Keeping Big Oil Loyal"
USA_keeping_big_oil_loyal_desc:0 "Drill, baby Drill. Oil is the black lifeblood of modern American life, and while some environment-crazed Liberals may scoff at the Industry as they cry 'No Blood for Oil!', President Rumsfeld knows that Oil is key to maintaining a strong economy. The drilling bans instituted by George H.W. Bush shall be torn up, the Oil Industry shall be free to expand into the Gulf of Mexico, and our diplomatic focus shall turn to oil-rich regions such as Texas."
USA_ultrahawkish_foreign_policy:0 "Ultrahawkish Foreign Policy"
USA_ultrahawkish_foreign_policy_desc:0 "We cannot allow the forces of Communism to claim another inch of this globe. Duty demands we endure. Honour compels us to strike back. Every part of America's heart and soul must be dedicated to eradicating Communism wherever it may stand - be it at home or abroad. While some may call for us to focus our efforts on the homefront, Rumsfeld knows that there is no victory here if there is no victory abroad. We could abandon those struggling against the Reds abroad - but if we did, it would be like losing the Cold War all over again."
USA_enhanced_interrogation:0 "Enhanced Interrogation"
USA_enhanced_interrogation_desc:0 "While Congress, the lower courts, and the Commie judges of the 'SCOTUSSR' have been frothing at the mouth to challenge orders they in their infinite lack of wisdom have declared to be 'Illegal', Professor John Yoo has come up with some creative ways to justify what the sissy Congress can't. The Unitary Executive Theory has been invoked to ensure Executive Authority shall not be impeded, that all decisions made by the President, no matter how legally grey they may be, will continue to trump the word of the law. With Yoo's legal magic at work, we can at last get to work rooting out Terrorist Scum. We still control Gitmo, right? I'm sure we could find a good use for it..."
USA_the_second_nixon:0 "Legacy of Nixon"
USA_the_second_nixon_desc:0 "In a world of weak-willed Presidents like Reagan and Carter, Richard Nixon stands out as a true American Patriot who was tragically killed for what he believed in. While some continue to hold Nixon in contempt for folding during the Cuban Missile Crisis, death absolves all sins, and given the 'controversial' presidencies of Nixon's two Republican successors, Nixon remains the GOP's most positive role-model besides Bush and Rumsfeld. 'Tricky Dick' is the man every American should aspire to be, a great statesman and leader who could have saved America if not for his tragic death at the hands of a deranged Communist Assassin."
USA_rehabilitate_ashbrook:0 "Rehabilitate Ashbrook"
USA_rehabilitate_ashbrook_desc:0 "A young Donald Rumsfeld first got his start working as a meager staffer in the Ashbrook White House. Ashbrook has been smeared unfairly by both History and the Liberal Media. He was a brave man who defended his country, who stood up to Liberal Crooks and Pacifist Hordes. Even his detractors can only point to one crime - his supposed involvement in a failed Spanish coup, an entirely justifiably cause in the eyes of history. At last the time has come to do away with weak-willed ideologues such as Goldwater and Reagan, and embrace the GOP's status as the Party of Bush, the Party of Rumsfeld, and the Party of Ashbrook."
USA_rumsfeldia:0 "Rumsfeldia"
USA_rumsfeldia_desc:0 "Despite the naysaying of dogooders and Communist, President Donald Rumsfeld has pulled off the feat of the Century. The squatters have been evicted. The insurgents defeated. President Donald H. Rumsfeld has at last restored the power of the Federal Government across America, undoing Reagan's shame and completing the mission George H.W. Bush set upon so many years ago: the complete restoration of the United States of America. While it was not an easy road, now, all Americans can rest easy knowing that the Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave has triumphantly returned, that the majestic Bald Eagle once more majesticly soars over America's skies. At last, the memories of the 20 years of division can begin fading like a bad dream."

USA_president_bush:0 "President Bush's Agenda"
USA_president_bush_desc:0 "With the main issues of the day sorted, the Second President Bush can at last get to implementing his agenda as President of the American Republic. A cooperative Congress has ensured easy passage of the President's policies, all while GOP loyalty slowly returns following Jeb's attempts to divide the Party. The State of the Union is Strong. The time has come to get to work repairing America."
USA_retreat_from_hawkishness:0 "Retreat from Hawkishness"
USA_retreat_from_hawkishness_desc:0 "While under Rumsfeld's rule the Government was more than happy to spend billions supporting backwater regimes such as Yemen and try for impossible aims like overthrowing Castro, under Jeb Bush, a radical retrenchment of the nation's Foreign Policy Goals is in order. The Commonwealth and the UAPR are our main threat, and before we can even begin thinking of beating back the forces of Communism in the wider world, we must restore American leadership first."
USA_purge_rumsfeld_loyalists:0 "Purge Rumsfeld Loyalists"
USA_purge_rumsfeld_loyalists_desc:0 "Rummy may have thrown a spanner into the GOP's machinery out of spite for his universally unpopular agenda - rigging the 2010 RNC to favour his own continued rule, but thankfully the people of the American Republic have been wise enough to see through Rumsfeld's four eyes into his dark soul. Yet still, Rumsfeld's loyalists continue to slither within the Grand Old Party. They must be dispatched with, and replaced forthright with Republicans loyal to the Bush Vision."
USA_grammer_on_the_radio:0 "Grammer on the Radio"
USA_grammer_on_the_radio_desc:0 "With Conservative titans such as Rush Limbaugh exposed as frauds due to their virulent support for Former President Rumsfeld, a new beacon of Conservatism on the airwaves is needed. This new Conservative Radio Revolution has come in the form of one smooth-talking Disc Jockey born in the Virgin Islands. Kelsey Grammer, a renowned Conservative paragon has taken his soothing voice to the airwaves across the Republic, ensuring a steady message of Conservatism plays on radios across the Republic, all while we covertly boost his programing."
USA_expand_media_empire_bush:0 "Expand the GOP Media Empire"
USA_expand_media_empire_bush_desc:0 "Fox News has been blaring on the Teleset of every loyal Republican household from Norfolk to Baton Rouge ever since the network was first founded by noted British expat Rupert Murdoch. The near unbreakable grip of the GOP on the South's media apparatus is a part of why our party has enjoyed such constant electoral success - but the prevalence of Fox News alone isn't enough anymore. We need to get the FCC to work rooting out Communist media like CNN, brainchild of noted Castro devotee Ted Turner."
USA_knights_of_columbus:0 "Knights of Columbus"
USA_knights_of_columbus_desc:0 "Regardless of the status of the Separation, Christian Values remain important to the Republican Party in the South. Unfortunately, a particularly vocal accord of radical Evangelicals have been less than comfortable with Jeb Bush's status as the First Catholic President. The values of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior do not discriminate based on sect. We must remain to take a clear stance against Sectarianism, and empower Catholic organizations to protect the faithful across the South."
USA_hispanic_appeals:0 "Hispanic Appeals"
USA_hispanic_appeals_desc:0 "While Rumsfeld's popularity among Latino-Americans has always lingered in the mid 20% range, President Jeb Bush, in part due to his wife Columba, enjoys smashing approval ratings among the Hispanic population. With ads targeting Spanish-speaking voters playing on every radio in Florida, President Bush now seeks to repay the people who have always supported his candidacy, fighting back against discrimination within the South and censuring those who monger hate against Latino Americans."
USA_cooperate_with_the_independence_union:0 "Reach Out to Moderate Republicans"
USA_cooperate_with_the_independence_union_desc:0 "Jeb Bush, while undoubtedly no Liberal Republican himself, does seem to enjoy much more support among the GOP's 'Moderate' flank than his predecessor. In an effort to both break with the policies of the Rumsfeld Administration and undercut the Independence Union, President Bush has begun courting Liberal Republicans once more. Our commitment to Social Conservatism remains clear as day, but with some strategic appeals, we can hopefully stop the bleeding from our rightward flank. "
USA_restart_the_bush_cult:0 "Expand the Bush Cult"
USA_restart_the_bush_cult_desc:0 "As Reagan destroyed the very foundations of the United States, one man stood resolute in fighting for the values of America, even if no one else believed in him. 'Poppy' was the greatest President the United States ever had, his tireless efforts to salvage the American experiment gaining him the love and respect of countless Americans. While the Bush Senior is tragically not alive to see his vision of a United America come to fruition, his kin can utilize H.W.'s beloved status to expand support and approval for Republican policies."
USA_father_avenged:0 "Father's Mission Complete"
USA_father_avenged_desc:0 "The mission of the Father has been completed by the son. George H.W. Bush remained unflapping in his commitment to the American Dream, even as the nation abandoned hope. Yet 'Poppy' always remained steadfast. His father avenged, Jeb Bush now rules over a nation forever changed. America has been pulled from the ash, Reagan's greatest mistake undone by the iron will of the Republican Party. Only thanks to the perseverance of the Bush family has the United States been restored. God Bless America - long live the Bush Dynasty!"
USA_flawless_victory:0 "A Flawless Victory"
USA_flawless_victory_desc:0 "President John Ellis Bush has gone down in history as the greatest American President since Abraham Lincoln, fearlessly working to build the American Republic into a backwater joke into the only force truly capable of Uniting the Divided States. With polls across America showing a whopping 79% approval rating, many have predicted that Jeb Bush could easily sweep every single state if the Election were held today. Across America a torrent of applause rings out as Jeb Bush, son of the Great Leader George Bush, takes his rightful place sitting atop America's throne."

USA_president_cheney:0 "President Cheney's Agenda"
USA_president_cheney_desc:0 "Donald Rumsfeld was a great friend and mentor to Dick Cheney. He isn't sorry for what he had to do to Rummy. He knew he wouldn't be. Now, the President has quite the task ahead of him, with Bible-Thumping troglodytes, Conspiracy Theorists and whiny Daddy's Boys at his tail. If Cheney is to escape from the fires of burning hell that is modern day Washington (located in Atlanta), then he has a lot of hard work ahead of him. Let us begin."
USA_take_care_of_jeb:0 "Take Care of Jeb"
USA_take_care_of_jeb_desc:0 "Jeb Bush, that sniveling cocksucker has always thought that he was entitled to leadership of the GOP. Nothing about the last eight years has swayed him from believing that the Presidency is his birthright. Cheney knows how to strike up a more compassionate tone than the late President Rumsfeld. Jeb thinks he can sink his teeth into the GOP now that Rummy's gone, but Cheney is convinced that he can talk the younger Bush out of doing something stupid. A hunting trip will surely be the best place to discuss such differences..."
USA_secure_congress_support:0 "Intimidate Congress"
USA_secure_congress_support_desc:0 "Rummy had allowed the halls of power to be captured by Interventionist Dirtbags and Christian Conservative Freaks. As it stands the Legislative branch is a mad dog, swinging their axe wildly in hopes of getting a head. Cheney knows damn well he's at the top of the Speaker's shit list, and that if he lets the Christian Values caucus continue on their witch hunt then he can kiss the presidency goodbye. The Unitary Executive Theory is just what we need in such a time. Time to tell that whiny son-of-a-bitch in the Speaker's chair who's the boss around here."
USA_purge_the_christian_right:0 "Purge the Christian Right"
USA_purge_the_christian_right_desc:0 "Rumsfeld signed his own death warrant by selling his soul to the Evangelical Freaks hell bent on making America a theocracy. We can't allow that to happen. Coe and LaHaye may think they can continue to pull the strings, that Rummy's death is an opportunity for their careers to advance.... they're dead wrong. By hook or by crook, by handshake or a visit from our boys in the Bureau, we're going to tear the Faustian bargain between Rumsfeld and the Christian Right to shreds."
USA_corprate_loyalty:0 "Corporate Loyalty"
USA_corprate_loyalty_desc:0 "The world of Big Business produced Cheney, moulded him into the man he is today. Had it not been for Haliburton's deep pockets President Cheney would be another Carpetbagger rotting in the hallways of Atlanta, or decomposing on a ranch in Colorado. The GOP is committed to the ideals of Capitalism, so long as the forces of Capitalism are willing to play ball. As a middle-ground between Bush's Dirigisme and Rumsfeld's proposals for unregulated Capitalism, President Cheney is willing to make a deal, extensive deregulation in the domestic market, all while the looming threat of Nationalization looms over those unwilling to acquiesce to Cheney's whims."
USA_expand_the_nsa:0 "Empower the CIA"
USA_expand_the_nsa_desc:0 "Unlike the late Jeb Bush, Donald Rumsfeld was committed to the struggle against Communism no matter where it may be. Cheney's opinions on Rumsfeld's foreign policy has always remained... complex. A noble cause surely, but one which lacked focus and direction. President Cheney's vision for the world is one that focuses on pragmatism, one that focuses on battles the American Republic can win - not simply dumping burning piles of money into every forever war that pops up. By expanding the Agency, we can keep our Foreign Policy targeted, opposing Communism at home and Abroad in a realistic and sustainable manner."
USA_integrate_the_moderate_gop:0 "Integrate Moderate Republicans"
USA_integrate_the_moderate_gop_desc:0 "The extreme Christian Nationalist bent of Rumsfeld's Second Term drove countless Liberal Republicans into the arms of the Independence Union. Rumsfeld's... 'forced exit' has given President Cheney a chance to reach out and reassure this voter base once more. States Rights, Small Government, Capitalism, all of these shall be the causes championed by Cheney's GOP, forces also championed by the Independence Union. By stealing their thunder, we can effectively prevent the Independence Union from becoming a threat ever again."
USA_controlled_opposition:0 "Controlled Opposition"
USA_controlled_opposition_desc:0 "The Democratic Party has been left for dead in the South ever since the Great Collapse, much of its voter base integrated by the Independence Union in a desperate bid to unseat Republicans by any means necessary. Although GOP control of the Presidency has remained unchallenged since the Republic's founding, the story in Congress is much different, with both the IU and Democrats maintaining a strong resistance against Republicanism. Politics, as always, is a game of give and take. The Democrats are dogs, if we give them what they want, they'll roll over."
USA_legalize_gay_marrige:0 "Legalize Gay Marriage"
USA_legalize_gay_marrige_desc:0 "Cheney's overthrow of Rumsfeld was spurred by Rumsfeld's increasingly uncomfortable association with the Christian Values clique. The Christian Nationalist freaks threatened Cheney's family. He couldn't simply sit back and abide. Now, Rumsfeld and co are history, and with the unchallenged rule of the Presidency, Cheney is finally ready to do something he's wanted to do all along. No longer are the naysayers going to shame Cheney into silence. Forthright, Same-Sex Marriage shall be legalized across the American Republic. The Jesus Freaks can bitch and moan all they want, but there's no closing this Pandora's Box."
USA_cheneycare:0 "Cheneycare"
USA_cheneycare_desc:0 "The corporate world may scream, but President Cheney has signalled his willingness to cut a deal. The Democratic Party is already putty in our hands after legalizing Gay Marriage, but they still have some give left. Healthcare Reform has been a controversial subject even in Liberal America, and Cheney implementing such a thing would be tantamount to unthinkable. And yet... The Democrats have sent a new Healthcare Bill, a bipartisan Insurance Subsidy Plan which America broadly supports. A penstroke has made this bill law, and while some in the Healthcare Industry may scream bloody murder at any attempt at reform, 'Cheneycare' is a way in which we can all win, reaping in the spoils of a new area of the Healthcare Industry all while appeasing the Democrats and the South's fickle and dirt-poor populace."
USA_night_watchmen_state:0 "Night-Watchman State"
USA_night_watchmen_state_desc:0 "The vision of men like Coe and LaHaye have been ones of state-mandated conformity. Of the rule of Preachers and Clerics and state-enforced loyalty to the almighty. We aren't having any of it. An ideal state is one that its inhabitant can barely register the existence of on a day-to-day basis. Our championed cause shall always be one of Small Government, of cutting Red Tape, not crucifying America on a cross of Big Government legislation. Cheney's vision is of an American Government dedicated to getting out of the way of people and Business alike - but will not shy away from utilizing its awesome power if ever challenged."
USA_miami_vice:0 "An American Khan"
USA_miami_vice_desc:0 "Forged in the great crucible of the Rockies, shaped by the glorious struggle of the American Steppe, Richard Bruce Cheney may be the most American man alive. After decades languishing in self-imposed exile in a desolate Southern Backwater, President Cheney has managed to do what Bush couldn't: restore the United States of America. An iron heart has propelled the American Emperor to his iron throne, the Devil laughing spreads his wings as Cheney claims the scepter of a new America. With a faceless snarl and not a word spoken, Cheney has claimed his blood-soaked crown, laughing silently, dancing a madman's dance on the whirling lost souls of the countless Americans crying in anguish over a nation forever lost to the oblivion of America's new crimson overlord ."

rw_american_republic.1.t:0 "Vice"
rw_american_republic.1.d:0 "Beware the quiet man. For while others speak, he watches. And while others act, he plans. And when they finally rest... he strikes. Donald Rumsfeld is a great man, a great mentor, and a great friend. However he has been driven astray by the Evangelical Right. Already Rummy's new allies in the Christian Values Caucus are drafting all sorts of legislation to outlaw Homosexuality and punish those who have shown 'Anti-Christian Values'. Richard Bruce Cheney is a Republican, but above all else he is a father. After Liz defected to the Union of the Heartlands, Dick has been left with only his daughter Mary, someone who is well known to the Evangelical wing of the GOP. Cheney's Lesbian daughter has certainly inspired hesitation by Rumsfeld to so publicly embrace the Christian Nationalist crusade, but it has failed to prevent his new allies from taking power within the Government. A lesser man would simply cross his hands and admit defeat, or resign in protest. But Dick Cheney is not like other men. To defend his country, and to defend his family, action must be taken. Rummy doesn't know it, but his time is running out..."

rw_american_republic.2.t:0 "Donald Rumsfeld Disappears"
rw_american_republic.2.d:0 "Black Ties were worn and the finest Champagne in the American Republic was poured in the event of the season. Washington D.C., while no longer our nation's capital due to its isolation from American territory, still remains an important cultural and social hub for the American Republic's elite. President Rumsfeld himself was in attendance in the latest Church-sponsored fundraiser, flanked by his new Evangelical allies. President Rumsfeld's departure from the event was the last anyone ever saw of him. When going through a tunnel to Washington Dulles, Rumsfeld's limousine never came out the other side. D.C. is already in total lockdown as the FBI and NSA scour the city for signs of the President - however due to the City's status as an Exclave enveloped by Commonwealth territory, Rumsfeld's chances at survival are slim. Hours have passed with no ransom demands nor any sign of the President's limo, with every security camera in the city coming up blank for traces of Rumsfeld. Vice President Cheney has been sworn in as Acting President until the search can conclude. Due to Cheney's work to establish a parallel administration to Rumsfeld's Evangelical Cabinet, the Presidential transition is set to be a smooth one if Rumsfeld is indeed gone forever."
