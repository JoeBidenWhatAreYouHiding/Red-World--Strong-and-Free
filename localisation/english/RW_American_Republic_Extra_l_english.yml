USA_divided_gop:0 "A Divided GOP"
USA_divided_gop_desc:0 "Jeb Bush's insurgent Independent Republican campaign against President Donald Rumsfeld has shattered the Grand Old Party as we know it. The Republicans have been brought to the brink of electoral extinction, and while thankfully they have warded off the worst consequences of vote splitting, a divided Party is good for nobody. [USA.GetLeader], renewed with a fresh mandate, must restore a sense of unity within their party, oiling the gears of the Republican machine and ensuring that 2010's close call can never be repeated."
USA_divided_gop_worse:0 "A Divided GOP"
USA_divided_gop_worse_desc:0 "Donald Rumsfeld's tragic disappearance has almost completely shattered the Republican Party as we know it. The moderate, Socially Liberal Vice President Cheney stands in stark contrast to the Evangelical groups that President Rumsfeld was courting before his tragic demise. Combined with continued resistance from members of the Bush Clan, President Cheney stands as the leader of a divided Party. The Christian Right has proclaimed Cheney to be Satan incarnate... perhaps they're right?"

### Focuses ###

USA_the_legitimate_government:0 "The Legitimate Government"
USA_the_legitimate_government_desc:0 "Long United Must Divide. Long Divided Must Unite. The Former United States is languishing under decades of division. As the legal inheritors of the mantle of the United States following Reagan's abdication of the office, the American Republic is the sole legitimate Government to the entirety of the United States. The time has come to prove it. No more sitting on our asses. All the President's Horses and all the President's men, are going to put America back together again."

USA_president_rumsfeld:0 "President Rumsfeld's Agenda"
USA_president_rumsfeld_desc:0 "With the main issues of the day sorted, President Rumsfeld can at last get to implementing his agenda as President of the American Republic. A cooperative Congress has ensured easy passage of the President's policies, all while GOP loyalty slowly returns following Jeb's attempts to divide the Party. The State of the Union is Strong. The time has come to get to work repairing America."
USA_secure_gop_loyalty:0 "Secure GOP Loyalty"
USA_secure_gop_loyalty_desc:0 "That wiley pissant little daddy’s boy bastard spawn of President Bush has finally had his little 'Rebellion' stomped out with extreme prejudice. Try as he may to throw a spanner into the works we have beat back that whiny little cocksucker and all his 'Bush Loyalist' Ivy League friends. Now is the time to clear out the GOP of its cobwebs, kick 'Jeb' to the curb and sweep the Bush Dynasty into the dustbin of history where it belongs."
USA_limbaugh_on_the_radio:0 "Limbaugh on the Airwaves"
USA_limbaugh_on_the_radio_desc:0 "Humming along on the radio sets of every car in the Republic is the piercing voice of one man: RUSH LIMBAUGH. This renowned Disc Jockey has defined modern Conservatism, delivering to the people the facts from a Republican perspective. The man is a natural echo chamber, an uncompromising voice for Conservative values. We ought to use this man to spread President Rumsfeld's agenda."
USA_expand_media_empire:0 "Expand the Republican Media Empire"
USA_expand_media_empire_desc:0 "Fox News has been blaring on the Teleset of every loyal Republican household from Norfolk to Baton Rouge ever since the network was first founded by noted British expat Rupert Murdoch. The near unbreakable grip of the GOP on the South's media apparatus is a part of why our party has enjoyed such constant electoral success - but the prevalence of Fox News alone isn't enough anymore. We need to get the FCC to work rooting out Communist media like CNN, brainchild of noted Castro devotee Ted Turner."
USA_reach_out_to_the_christian_right:0 "Our Friends in the Christian Right"
USA_reach_out_to_the_christian_right_desc:0 "If there's one thing the South loves more than fornicating with their cousins and enjoying their nanna's Peach Cobbler, it's God. While Reagan has been discredited, and rightfully so, the influence of his abortive Presidency on the Evangelical Right still continues on to this day. Much to the chagrin of Liberal Republicans, President Rumsfeld has moved to shore up his credentials with the Christian Right, ensuring the interpretation of 'Southern Values' remains to God's liking, and that insidious forces such as Homosexuality and Abortion are not allowed to spread like the Kudzu vines that are slowly but surely strangling our Dixie."
USA_vision_of_coe:0 "The Vision of Coe and LaHaye"
USA_vision_of_coe_desc:0 "Under the Cross lies the reborn American Republic, emerging from the rot with a newfound moral code, thanks to our friends in the Evangelical right. The South is God's country, and those who seek to deny the power of the almighty have no place in our Jesus-loving society. Only the most God-fearing Red-Blooded Americans shall be granted a seat at the table, as President Rumsfeld gives carte blanche to figures such as Douglas Coe and Tim LaHaye in exchange for God's support for President Rumsfeld's righteous Crusade to free the world of Wicked Communism."
USA_defenders_of_christian_faith:0 "Under His Eye"
USA_defenders_of_christian_faith_desc:0 "God, Freedom, and Country are all back in vogue here in the American Republic. Rumsfeld, himself seemingly ambivalent to the Evangelical cause, is now relying more and more heavily on the undercurrent of Fundamentalist support growing within the GOP. Under the immutable rule of Christian Values, we shall seek to create a new United States, with laws and principles fundamentally based on God's Ten Commandments. While some have been so rude as to call this new America a 'Theocracy', the GOP is committed solely to the values and principles that make the South the beacon of morality that continues to shine against Communist degeneracy."
USA_big_buisnes_loyalty:0 "A Commitment to Capitalism"
USA_big_buisnes_loyalty_desc:0 "While we worship the almighty, there is another force that beacons to us from beyond the ether: Capitalism. If we are to beat the Communists, then we must embrace our Capitalist roots, worshiping the twin GOP deities of Capitalism and the Christian God, and undo the dangerous anti-Free Market reforms implemented during the Bush years. Our road to salvation is paved with the almighty dollar."
USA_extreme_deregulation:0 "Extensive Deregulation"
USA_extreme_deregulation_desc:0 "The business class has been put into a chokehold by the burdens of overregulation. Rumsfeld's agenda shall be one of breaking with the late President's policies of Dirigisme in an effort to force Businesses to stay in the South instead of relocating to Canada - something which has had the opposite effect, instead driving Businesses North. Rumsfeld's abolition of these policies, combined with an across-the-board cut in the minimum wage, shall help communicate that we mean Business." 
USA_keeping_big_oil_loyal:0 "Keeping Big Oil Loyal"
USA_keeping_big_oil_loyal_desc:0 "Drill, baby Drill. Oil is the black lifeblood of modern American life, and while some environment-crazed Liberals may scoff at the Industry as they cry 'No Blood for Oil!', President Rumsfeld knows that Oil is key to maintaining a strong economy. The drilling bans instituted by George H.W. Bush shall be torn up, the Oil Industry shall be free to expand into the Gulf of Mexico, and our diplomatic focus shall turn to oil-rich regions such as Texas."
USA_ultrahawkish_foreign_policy:0 "Ultrahawkish Foreign Policy"
USA_ultrahawkish_foreign_policy_desc:0 "We cannot allow the forces of Communism to claim another inch of this globe. Duty demands we endure. Honour compels us to strike back. Every part of America's heart and soul must be dedicated to eradicating Communism wherever it may stand - be it at home or abroad. While some may call for us to focus our efforts on the homefront, Rumsfeld knows that there is no victory here if there is no victory abroad. We could abandon those struggling against the Reds abroad - but if we did, it would be like losing the Cold War all over again."
USA_enhanced_interrogation:0 "Enhanced Interrogation"
USA_enhanced_interrogation_desc:0 "While Congress, the lower courts, and the Commie judges of the 'SCOTUSSR' have been frothing at the mouth to challenge orders they in their infinite lack of wisdom have declared to be 'Illegal', Professor John Yoo has come up with some creative ways to justify what the sissy Congress can't. The Unitary Executive Theory has been invoked to ensure Executive Authority shall not be impeded, that all decisions made by the President, no matter how legally grey they may be, will continue to trump the word of the law. With Yoo's legal magic at work, we can at last get to work rooting out Terrorist Scum. We still control Gitmo, right? I'm sure we could find a good use for it..."
USA_the_second_nixon:0 "Legacy of Nixon"
USA_the_second_nixon_desc:0 "In a world of weak-willed Presidents like Reagan and Carter, Richard Nixon stands out as a true American Patriot who was tragically killed for what he believed in. While some continue to hold Nixon in contempt for folding during the Cuban Missile Crisis, death absolves all sins, and given the 'controversial' presidencies of Nixon's two Republican successors, Nixon remains the GOP's most positive role-model besides Bush and Rumsfeld. 'Tricky Dick' is the man every American should aspire to be, a great statesman and leader who could have saved America if not for his tragic death at the hands of a deranged Communist Assassin."
USA_rehabilitate_ashbrook:0 "Rehabilitate Ashbrook"
USA_rehabilitate_ashbrook_desc:0 "A young Donald Rumsfeld first got his start working as a meager staffer in the Ashbrook White House. Ashbrook has been smeared unfairly by both History and the Liberal Media. He was a brave man who defended his country, who stood up to Liberal Crooks and Pacifist Hordes. Even his detractors can only point to one crime - his supposed involvement in a failed Spanish coup, an entirely justifiably cause in the eyes of history. At last the time has come to do away with weak-willed ideologues such as Goldwater and Reagan, and embrace the GOP's status as the Party of Bush, the Party of Rumsfeld, and the Party of Ashbrook."
USA_rumsfeldia:0 "Rumsfeldia"
USA_rumsfeldia_desc:0 "Despite the naysaying of dogooders and Communist, President Donald Rumsfeld has pulled off the feat of the Century. The squatters have been evicted. The insurgents defeated. President Donald H. Rumsfeld has at last restored the power of the Federal Government across America, undoing Reagan's shame and completing the mission George H.W. Bush set upon so many years ago: the complete restoration of the United States of America. While it was not an easy road, now, all Americans can rest easy knowing that the Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave has triumphantly returned, that the majestic Bald Eagle once more majesticly soars over America's skies. At last, the memories of the 20 years of division can begin fading like a bad dream."

USA_president_bush:0 "President Bush's Agenda"
USA_president_bush_desc:0 "With the main issues of the day sorted, the Second President Bush can at last get to implementing his agenda as President of the American Republic. A cooperative Congress has ensured easy passage of the President's policies, all while GOP loyalty slowly returns following Jeb's attempts to divide the Party. The State of the Union is Strong. The time has come to get to work repairing America."
USA_retreat_from_hawkishness:0 "Retreat from Hawkishness"
USA_retreat_from_hawkishness_desc:0 "While under Rumsfeld's rule the Government was more than happy to spend billions supporting backwater regimes such as Yemen and try for impossible aims like overthrowing Castro, under Jeb Bush, a radical retrenchment of the nation's Foreign Policy Goals is in order. The Commonwealth and the UAPR are our main threat, and before we can even begin thinking of beating back the forces of Communism in the wider world, we must restore American leadership first."
USA_purge_rumsfeld_loyalists:0 "Purge Rumsfeld Loyalists"
USA_purge_rumsfeld_loyalists_desc:0 "Rummy may have thrown a spanner into the GOP's machinery out of spite for his universally unpopular agenda - rigging the 2010 RNC to favour his own continued rule, but thankfully the people of the American Republic have been wise enough to see through Rumsfeld's four eyes into his dark soul. Yet still, Rumsfeld's loyalists continue to slither within the Grand Old Party. They must be dispatched with, and replaced forthright with Republicans loyal to the Bush Vision."
USA_grammer_on_the_radio:0 "Grammer on the Radio"
USA_grammer_on_the_radio_desc:0 "With Conservative titans such as Rush Limbaugh exposed as frauds due to their virulent support for Former President Rumsfeld, a new beacon of Conservatism on the airwaves is needed. This new Conservative Radio Revolution has come in the form of one smooth-talking Disc Jockey born in the Virgin Islands. Kelsey Grammer, a renowned Conservative paragon has taken his soothing voice to the airwaves across the Republic, ensuring a steady message of Conservatism plays on radios across the Republic, all while we covertly boost his programing."
USA_expand_media_empire_bush:0 "Expand the GOP Media Empire"
USA_expand_media_empire_bush_desc:0 "Fox News has been blaring on the Teleset of every loyal Republican household from Norfolk to Baton Rouge ever since the network was first founded by noted British expat Rupert Murdoch. The near unbreakable grip of the GOP on the South's media apparatus is a part of why our party has enjoyed such constant electoral success - but the prevalence of Fox News alone isn't enough anymore. We need to get the FCC to work rooting out Communist media like CNN, brainchild of noted Castro devotee Ted Turner."
USA_new_populism:0 "New Republican Populism"
USA_new_populism_desc:0 "The 'P' in GOP dosen't stand for Party - it stands for People. Well it does actually stand for Party but you get what we mean. Under Rumsfeld, the Republican Party stood for only the ideals of Big Buisness and the Military-Industrial Complex. However President Bush, brought to power on a wave of Populist and anti-Authoritarian policies, now seeks to reinvigorate the spirit of American Populism, ensuring that this government will work for the many not the few, and will never bend to the will of Corporations and Special Interests."
USA_hispanic_appeals:0 "Hispanic Appeals"
USA_hispanic_appeals_desc:0 "While Rumsfeld's popularity among Latino-Americans has always lingered in the mid 20% range, President Jeb Bush, in part due to his wife Columba, enjoys smashing approval ratings among the Hispanic population. With ads targeting Spanish-speaking voters playing on every radio in Florida, President Bush now seeks to repay the people who have always supported his candidacy, fighting back against discrimination within the South and censuring those who monger hate against Latino Americans."
USA_cooperate_with_the_independence_union:0 "Reach Out to Moderate Conservatives"
USA_cooperate_with_the_independence_union_desc:0 "Jeb Bush, while undoubtedly no Liberal Republican himself, does seem to enjoy much more support among the GOP's 'Moderate' flank than his predecessor. In an effort to both break with the policies of the Rumsfeld Administration and undercut the Independence Union, President Bush has begun courting Liberal Republicans once more. Our commitment to Social Conservatism remains clear as day, but with some strategic appeals, we can hopefully stop the bleeding from our rightward flank. "
USA_restart_the_bush_cult:0 "Expand the Bush Cult"
USA_restart_the_bush_cult_desc:0 "As Reagan destroyed the very foundations of the United States, one man stood resolute in fighting for the values of America, even if no one else believed in him. 'Poppy' was the greatest President the United States ever had, his tireless efforts to salvage the American experiment gaining him the love and respect of countless Americans. While the Bush Senior is tragically not alive to see his vision of a United America come to fruition, his kin can utilize H.W.'s beloved status to expand support and approval for Republican policies."
USA_father_avenged:0 "Father's Mission Complete"
USA_father_avenged_desc:0 "The mission of the Father has been completed by the son. George H.W. Bush remained unflapping in his commitment to the American Dream, even as the nation abandoned hope. Yet 'Poppy' always remained steadfast. His father avenged, Jeb Bush now rules over a nation forever changed. America has been pulled from the ash, Reagan's greatest mistake undone by the iron will of the Republican Party. Only thanks to the perseverance of the Bush family has the United States been restored. God Bless America - long live the Bush Dynasty!"
USA_flawless_victory:0 "A Flawless Victory"
USA_flawless_victory_desc:0 "President John Ellis Bush has gone down in history as the greatest American President since Abraham Lincoln, fearlessly working to build the American Republic into a backwater joke into the only force truly capable of Uniting the Divided States. With polls across America showing a whopping 79% approval rating, many have predicted that Jeb Bush could easily sweep every single state if the Election were held today. Across America a torrent of applause rings out as Jeb Bush, son of the Great Leader George Bush, takes his rightful place sitting atop America's throne."

USA_president_cheney:0 "President Cheney's Agenda"
USA_president_cheney_desc:0 "Donald Rumsfeld was a great friend and mentor to Dick Cheney. He isn't sorry for what he had to do to Rummy. He knew he wouldn't be. Now, the President has quite the task ahead of him, with Bible-Thumping troglodytes, Conspiracy Theorists and whiny Daddy's Boys at his tail. If Cheney is to escape from the fires of burning hell that is modern day Washington (located in Atlanta), then he has a lot of hard work ahead of him. Let us begin."
USA_take_care_of_jeb:0 "Take Care of Jeb"
USA_take_care_of_jeb_desc:0 "Jeb Bush, that sniveling cocksucker has always thought that he was entitled to leadership of the GOP. Nothing about the last eight years has swayed him from believing that the Presidency is his birthright. Cheney knows how to strike up a more compassionate tone than the late President Rumsfeld. Jeb thinks he can sink his teeth into the GOP now that Rummy's gone, but Cheney is convinced that he can talk the younger Bush out of doing something stupid. A hunting trip will surely be the best place to discuss such differences..."
USA_secure_congress_support:0 "Intimidate Congress"
USA_secure_congress_support_desc:0 "Rummy had allowed the halls of power to be captured by Interventionist Dirtbags and Christian Conservative Freaks. As it stands the Legislative branch is a mad dog, swinging their axe wildly in hopes of getting a head. Cheney knows damn well he's at the top of the Speaker's shit list, and that if he lets the Christian Values caucus continue on their witch hunt then he can kiss the presidency goodbye. The Unitary Executive Theory is just what we need in such a time. Time to tell that whiny son-of-a-bitch in the Speaker's chair who's the boss around here."
USA_purge_the_christian_right:0 "Purge the Christian Right"
USA_purge_the_christian_right_desc:0 "Rumsfeld signed his own death warrant by selling his soul to the Evangelical Freaks hell bent on making America a theocracy. We can't allow that to happen. Coe and LaHaye may think they can continue to pull the strings, that Rummy's death is an opportunity for their careers to advance.... they're dead wrong. By hook or by crook, by handshake or a visit from our boys in the Bureau, we're going to tear the Faustian bargain between Rumsfeld and the Christian Right to shreds."
USA_corprate_loyalty:0 "Corporate Loyalty"
USA_corprate_loyalty_desc:0 "The world of Big Business produced Cheney, moulded him into the man he is today. Had it not been for Haliburton's deep pockets President Cheney would be another Carpetbagger rotting in the hallways of Atlanta, or decomposing on a ranch in Colorado. The GOP is committed to the ideals of Capitalism, so long as the forces of Capitalism are willing to play ball. As a middle-ground between Bush's Dirigisme and Rumsfeld's proposals for unregulated Capitalism, President Cheney is willing to make a deal, extensive deregulation in the domestic market, all while the looming threat of Nationalization looms over those unwilling to acquiesce to Cheney's whims."
USA_expand_the_nsa:0 "Empower the CIA"
USA_expand_the_nsa_desc:0 "Unlike the late Jeb Bush, Donald Rumsfeld was committed to the struggle against Communism no matter where it may be. Cheney's opinions on Rumsfeld's foreign policy has always remained... complex. A noble cause surely, but one which lacked focus and direction. President Cheney's vision for the world is one that focuses on pragmatism, one that focuses on battles the American Republic can win - not simply dumping burning piles of money into every forever war that pops up. By expanding the Agency, we can keep our Foreign Policy targeted, opposing Communism at home and Abroad in a realistic and sustainable manner."
USA_integrate_the_moderate_gop:0 "Integrate Moderate Republicans"
USA_integrate_the_moderate_gop_desc:0 "The extreme Christian Nationalist bent of Rumsfeld's Second Term drove countless Liberal Republicans into the arms of the Independence Union. Rumsfeld's... 'forced exit' has given President Cheney a chance to reach out and reassure this voter base once more. States Rights, Small Government, Capitalism, all of these shall be the causes championed by Cheney's GOP, forces also championed by the Independence Union. By stealing their thunder, we can effectively prevent the Independence Union from becoming a threat ever again."
USA_controlled_opposition:0 "Controlled Opposition"
USA_controlled_opposition_desc:0 "The Democratic Party has been left for dead in the South ever since the Great Collapse, much of its voter base integrated by the Independence Union in a desperate bid to unseat Republicans by any means necessary. Although GOP control of the Presidency has remained unchallenged since the Republic's founding, the story in Congress is much different, with both the IU and Democrats maintaining a strong resistance against Republicanism. Politics, as always, is a game of give and take. The Democrats are dogs, if we give them what they want, they'll roll over."
USA_legalize_gay_marrige:0 "Legalize Gay Marriage"
USA_legalize_gay_marrige_desc:0 "Cheney's overthrow of Rumsfeld was spurred by Rumsfeld's increasingly uncomfortable association with the Christian Values clique. The Christian Nationalist freaks threatened Cheney's family. He couldn't simply sit back and abide. Now, Rumsfeld and co are history, and with the unchallenged rule of the Presidency, Cheney is finally ready to do something he's wanted to do all along. No longer are the naysayers going to shame Cheney into silence. Forthright, Same-Sex Marriage shall be legalized across the American Republic. The Jesus Freaks can bitch and moan all they want, but there's no closing this Pandora's Box."
USA_cheneycare:0 "Cheneycare"
USA_cheneycare_desc:0 "The corporate world may scream, but President Cheney has signalled his willingness to cut a deal. The Democratic Party is already putty in our hands after legalizing Gay Marriage, but they still have some give left. Healthcare Reform has been a controversial subject even in Liberal America, and Cheney implementing such a thing would be tantamount to unthinkable. And yet... The Democrats have sent a new Healthcare Bill, a bipartisan Insurance Subsidy Plan which America broadly supports. A penstroke has made this bill law, and while some in the Healthcare Industry may scream bloody murder at any attempt at reform, 'Cheneycare' is a way in which we can all win, reaping in the spoils of a new area of the Healthcare Industry all while appeasing the Democrats and the South's fickle and dirt-poor populace."
USA_night_watchmen_state:0 "Night-Watchman State"
USA_night_watchmen_state_desc:0 "The vision of men like Coe and LaHaye have been ones of state-mandated conformity. Of the rule of Preachers and Clerics and state-enforced loyalty to the almighty. We aren't having any of it. An ideal state is one that its inhabitant can barely register the existence of on a day-to-day basis. Our championed cause shall always be one of Small Government, of cutting Red Tape, not crucifying America on a cross of Big Government legislation. Cheney's vision is of an American Government dedicated to getting out of the way of people and Business alike - but will not shy away from utilizing its awesome power if ever challenged."
USA_miami_vice:0 "The Great American Khanate"
USA_miami_vice_desc:0 "Forged in the great crucible of the Rockies, shaped by the glorious struggle of the American Steppe, Richard Bruce Cheney may be the most American man alive. After decades languishing in self-imposed exile in a desolate Southern Backwater, President Cheney has managed to do what Bush couldn't: restore the United States of America. An iron heart has propelled the American Emperor to his iron throne, the Devil laughing spreads his wings as Cheney claims the scepter of a new America. With a faceless snarl and not a word spoken, Cheney has claimed his blood-soaked crown, laughing silently, dancing a madman's dance on the whirling lost souls of the countless Americans crying in anguish over a nation forever lost to the oblivion of America's new crimson overlord ."

rw_american_republic.1.d:0 "Beware the quiet man. For while others speak, he watches. And while others act, he plans. And when they finally rest... he strikes. Donald Rumsfeld is a great man, a great mentor, and a great friend. However he has been driven astray by the Evangelical Right. Already Rummy's new allies in the Christian Values Caucus are drafting all sorts of legislation to outlaw Homosexuality and punish those who have shown 'Anti-Christian Values'. Richard Bruce Cheney is a Republican, but above all else he is a father. After Liz defected to the Union of the Heartlands to support the cause of Hillary Rodham, Dick has been left with only his daughter Mary, someone who is well known to the Evangelical wing of the GOP. Cheney's Lesbian daughter has certainly inspired hesitation by Rumsfeld to so publicly embrace the Christian Nationalist crusade, but it has failed to prevent his new allies from taking power within the Government. As a young man, Cheney asked to Rumsfeld what he stood for. As it seems, Rumsfeld stands for nothing. But Cheney is no Rumsfeld. Cheney, like his mentor, seems loyal to only the prospect of greater power. However for the Vice President, there is one loyalty greater than the loyalty to power. Family. A lesser man would simply cross his hands and admit defeat, or resign in protest. But Dick Cheney is not like other men. To defend his country, and to defend his family, action must be taken. Cheney has been planning this moment for decades, already aligning all the pieces on his chess board. The President can't see that Cheney is one move away from a Checkmate. The Presidency stirs as a plot to save America materializes. Rummy doesn't know it, but his time is running out..."

Washington D.C., while no longer our nation's capital due to its isolation from American territory, still remains an important cultural and social hub for the American Republic's elite. President Rumsfeld himself was in attendance in the latest Church-sponsored fundraiser, flanked by his new Evangelical allies. Through the heavy snowfall, the people of Washington D.C. witnessed Rumsfeld's motorcade driving through the streets, their headlights piercing through the falling snow as they traversed the City. President Rumsfeld's departure from the event was the last anyone ever saw of him. When going through a tunnel to Washington Dulles, Rumsfeld's limousine never came out the other side. D.C. is already in total lockdown as the FBI and NSA scour the city for signs of the President - however due to the City's status as an Exclave enveloped by Commonwealth territory, Rumsfeld's chances at survival are slim. Hours have passed with no ransom demands nor any sign of the President's limo, with every security camera in the city coming up blank for traces of Rumsfeld. Vice President Cheney has been sworn in as Acting President until the search can conclude. Due to Cheney's work to establish a parallel administration to Rumsfeld's Evangelical Cabinet, the Presidential transition is set to be a smooth one if Rumsfeld is indeed gone forever."

With a loyal Congress, President Rumsfeld's agenda is not expected to be holed up or challenged in any significant way, save from some fringe Independence Unionites or radical Democrats. Although Rumsfeld's mandate has been tried in recent elections, with the 2010 election being the first legitimately competitive election in the history of the American Republic, the President's mandate remains stronger than ever. Rumsfeld, flanked by his Vice President and the House Speaker, has delivered a rip-roaring address to the halls of Congress, laying out his priorities for the Legislative year. As well, Rumsfeld rallied Americans against the forces of Communism and Socialism that continue to occupy the Northeast and the Pacific Coast. While some within the Legislature have boycotted Rumsfeld's speech in protest, particularly Democrats and die-hard loyalists to the Bush Dynasty who no longer find themselves at home in the GOP, Rumsfeld's speech has gone down well with Americans, with 64% of those polls having a positive impression of Rumsfeld's address."

rw_american_republic.4.d:0 "Jeb Bush's jackass stunt at the 2010 RNC nearly cost us the entire election. While thankfully the American Public managed to reject Socialist and Fascist insanity at the ballot box, with some light measures to 'secure' the vote, Donald Rumsfeld's image and credibility was badly damaged by the younger Bush's renegade GOP faction. Throughout the campaign Rumsfeld was smeared as being insincerely committed to the ideals of the late President George H.W. Bush, an accusation which has resonated through the GOP halls of power, where Bush remains incredibly popular. Privately, it is rumoured that Rumsfeld holds a genuine amount of disdain for his predecessor, with his hatred of H.W.'s spawn being well-known to just about everybody in the nation. The feelings appear to be mutual, with Bush Sr. even referring to Rumsfeld as 'Iron-Ass' privately before his term ended. Some measures have been made by Rusmsfeld to distance the GOP from the Bush Cult, as the President increasingly sees the late President's veneration as an unwitting boon to the turncoat Jeb Bush. While Rumsfeld publicly sings the praises of the 'Great Father' George H.W. Bush, in private, the Personality Cult around the Bush Family, particularly Jeb, is being torn down within the GOP. Jeb has been on with his usual bullshit, whining that Rumsfeld is trampling all over the legacy of his 'Poppy', even going so far as to accuse President Rumsfeld of having the Elder Bush killed. In Texas, George Jr. has called this turn 'disheartening', but appears more focused on his carreer as a baseball manager in Texas than with the political affairs of the American Republic. For what it's worth, the American public still stands by the Presidency's claim of a close friendshipn between H.W. and Rummy."

rw_american_republic.5.d:0 "Conservative media at the moment is defined by one man and one man alone: Rush Limbaugh. Across the American South, and in pirate stations across the Socialist-occupied territories in the Northeast and the Pacific, the unmistakable voice of Rush Limbaugh echoes. Amid a split in the Republican Party, having the loyalty of perhaps the most influential Conservative media figure is vital to the Rumsfeld's administration's command over both Congress and the Republican Electorate. As a staunch supporter of Former President Bush, Limbaugh has been instrumental in swaying those loyal to the 'Bush Cult' over to the GOP, with Limbaugh smearing Jeb as bitter over his father's preference for Rumsfeld over himself. While reports claim that by 2000 H.W. had fallen out with Rumsfeld, Limbaugh has fought back hard at these claims, working tirelessly to further the narrative that Rumsfeld was always the designated successor of the Bush Administration and thus the true Paragon of Conservative Values in the American Republic. As well, Limbaugh has been involved in attacks against Rumsfeld's 'Liberal Opposition' - with his rants against Democrats and the Independence Union thrilling Republicans across the nation, and making many Independence Unionites reconsider their opposition to the GOP. The President himself is a frequent guest on the show, further boosting his appeal to the American public. Radio is, and will always be a powerful tool in spreading our message to the American public, and although we have taken measures to safeguard elections for the GOP after 2010's close call, controlling the narrative remains a key coponent in massaging the public and preventing discontent."

rw_american_republic.6.d:0 "Aside from George H.W. Bush and the Dukes of Hazzard, Jesus Christ is the most beloved man in the entirety of the American Republic. The Christian values of the Southern United States have been instrumental in the region's successful resistance against the brainwashing forms of Communism. Our faith has kept us safe from insidious forces, and with that in mind, President Rumsfeld has sought support from those most instrumental in warding off the forces of Communism and Atheism. The Evangelical movement is alive and well in the American South, despite being veritably stamped out in the Communist-occupied territories. The forces of the Christian Right are powerful backers of the GOP, and the President has sought it fit to repay the favour. Rapidly, Evangelical-aligned members of the Republican Party have come together to form a 'Christian Values Caucus', one which already encompasses more than half of the GOP and is rapidly consolidating control in Congress. The crusade for Morality has sent the current House Speaker packing, with a relatively unknown backbencher by the name of Michael Johnson taking their place in a short amount of time. Rumsfeld has hailed this soft-coup of the Congressional GOP by the Christian Values Caucus as a welcome step forward, signalling continued cooperation with Evangelical forces in the South - something which has not gone over well with the remaining 'Liberal' and Moderate members of the GOP. As we move closer toward the vision of the late Rev. Falwell's vision, Athiests have cried out about the possible imposition of a Christian Theocracy in the South. Rumours have spread that certain figures in Rumsfeld's inner circle such as Dick Cheney are prepared to resign in disgust over this new Evangelical turn."

The American Department of Morality, a new cabinet level office has formally been created via an act of Congress, seeking to enforce the law of God in this land against the Heathens and Atheists who wish to pervert the wills and creations of the almighty. Pornography, Homosexuality, Satanism and Drug Use, this new ADM shall serve as the South's sword and shield against the forces of Sin. Widescale surveillance has been introduced in major cities to clamp down on Vice, as strict Moral Codes are introduced in the Media to prevent the spread of dangerous messaging. The nation's small but robust Intranet system has been put under Government control to prevent illicit or anti-Christian activity, stopping foreign Pornography or Communist Propaganda from infecting the minds of red-blooded Americans through the online world. While there remains a certain amount of conflict towards the approaches of the ADM internally, with some wishing to go so far as to ban the celebration of Halloween for being a 'Satanic Holiday', overall, the ADM has been a smashing success, with a firm control of the media ensuring Americans think of the ADM as a righteous force going after Devil-Worshipers and Pornographers. Suburbia has been guarded from dangerous and offensive thought once more, as we struggle to ensure that the American Republic remains One Nation, Under God."

rw_american_republic.8.d:0 "The Bush administration's approach to the Economy has been a point of contention for many within the Republican Party, even amongst those within the so-called 'Bush Cult'. The policies of Rumsfeld's predecessor can best be descrubed as a form of Dirigisme, where the government played an active role in directing industry. This approach, while noble in the pursuit of a Southern Industrial Base to help in the struggle to reclaim America, has ultimatley failed. The Bush Administration ultimatley failed to prevent buisness from fleeing to Canada, and now countless factories and buisnesses remain abandoned thanks to Free-Market concerns over possible Government overreach. President Rumsfeld, finally forced to reckon with his predecessor's decisions, has formally moved to court the titans of global Buisness once more. The titans of Industry, instead of the Evangelical nutjobs, shall be the focus of Rumsfeld's Second Term in office. This move has been hailed by many prominent officials such as Richard Cheney, who are happy to see increased profits and kickbacks from the GOP's new free-market approach. While some have accused Rumsfeld and co. of corruption for these acts, the President of all people knows that nothing can get done without greasing the wheels. The buisness of politics is, well, buisness, and as much as Economic Nationalists and Regulation enthusiasts wish to see us keep the boot of state on the neck of Commerce, we can no longer afford to alienate those willing to move money to save our nation. We simply can't."

rw_american_republic.9.d:0 "The world of big oil remains the most mind-bogglingly large industry on the face of the planet. Big Oil has moved mountains, literally, and thus far have proven more than amicable to the Rumsfeld Regime. Billions of dollars have flown into the private accounts of insiders in the Rumsfeld administration in exchange for movement on certain Legislative matters. As it stands, Offshore Drilling remains illegal in the American Republic, based on a statute signed by George H.W. Bush himself. However this regulation has proven radically unpopular with the Oil Industry, and with good reason. This industry-constraining regulation is a noose around the neck of honest American buisnessmen. No tears would be shed among the nation's elite if such a law was crumpled up and tossed into the waste basket. Effective immedatley, President Rumsfeld has lifted the ban on offshore drilling, opening up countless jobs for new Oil Rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. Among the key players in getting these regulations remove was longtime friend, ally and protege of Rumsfeld Dick Cheney, himself a former high-ranking executive at the oil service company Halliburton. Halliburton, coonicedentally, was also among the largest companies showed to be interested in contracts for drilling in the Gulf if oil drilling would open up within the area. While Green protesters and the Mexican Government may protest about the possibility of catastrophic ecological disasters, we can see that the risks are well worth the reward. The GOP is the Party of Buisness, and above else, we shall seek to ensure that Americans have access to high-paying jobs, particularly in the petroleum industry. Enviromental disasters are committed at a higher rate by the Communists anyway. "

rw_american_republic.10.d:0 "Law in the post-United States remains very fluid. Of the post-USA sucsessor states, the American Republic maintains the letter of the law that's closest to that of the former United States, something which has served as both a blessing and a curse. While the to-the-letter interpretation of the Constitition has prevented the President from using the full scope of his powers, even after 200 years of a cohesive American Legal System, new loopholes are being found in the letter of the law. A crack team of legal professors, ranging from Bush Loyalists such as Bill Barr, to Cheney's personal attorney Richard Armitage, to Korean expat John Yoo, have all pushed forward an interesting legal theory. The Unitary Executive Theory is quite the contreversial phrase within the halls of Atlanta. Sparing the legal speak, the Unitary Executive Theory means that in laymans terms, the President can do whatever the fuck he wants. One such area in which this theory has been applied is the use of torture, which while technically illegal in the former United States, can be circumvented with terms such as enhanced interrogation, and done in places such as Guantanamo Bay, where the US is in control despite it not being legally US territory. These loopholes have allowed us to creatively interpret the letter of the law - and while weak-willed Democrats may protest the Government taking care of buisness, declaring our actions to be authoritarian and illegal, to safeguard the future of the American Republic, it is nescacary to bend the rules a bit."

As once-paragons such as Rush Limbaugh fall out of favourite within the GOP's rank and file due to backing Rumsfeld's unsucsessful campaign in 2010, new titans such as Mr. Grammer have rapidly risen to fill the slot. Before his foree into radio, Kelsey Grammer was once a minor actor in Hollywood before the fall of the Pacific Coast, only finding his niche in radio following the establishment of the American Republic, which gained control of Grammer's native American Virgin Islands. While Limbaugh has attempted to make amends for picking the wrong team in 2010, it seems that his popularity has been forever damaged among Republicans who have quickly rallied around the second President Bush, even as Limbaugh tries to use his voice to atone for his past support for Rumsfeld and re-unite the Republican movement. President Bush himself has appeared on Grammer's show, further boosting the program's popularity as he rockets past the Limbaugh show in ratings and popularity. Grammer's sophisticated style and smoother-than-butter voice has injected an ere of culture into the Republican scene, as Grammer's form of intellectualism challenges Republicans to think, challenge their own presumptions, and approach the world of Conservative politics with a more intellectual bent. In contrast to Limbaugh's Shock Jock style, Grammer's show has been hailed as a great step forward in Republican political discourse, despite some claiming that Grammer's veneer of intellectualism is only surface deep."

Rumsfeld's ratfucking had ensured without much a doubt that Bush legitimatley gaining the Republican nomination was an impossiblty. Jeb, seeing through Rumsfeld's tricks, instead opted to fight for the Presidency outside the RNC's iron clutch, doing so despite the long odds against him. Even as Duke and Bentley spent the campaign tearing into the last 10 years of Republican rule, as well as each other, the spotlight of the Election was undoubtedly the rivalry between the two different currents of GOP thought, the Nationalist and Interventionist strain of Donald Rumsfeld, and the more Moderate, America-First strain of Jeb Bush. Despite long odds, the people of the American South rallied around Bush's campaign, the excitment and hope truly worth of the 'Jeb!' logo which became infamous on the Campaign Trail. With Rumsfeld bested at the ballot box, Jeb Bush is now firmly in control of the Republican Party, despite Rumsfeld's desperate attempts at clinging to power after his humilating election loss. As revenge for the decades of backroom deals and disrespect to his father's legacy, President Bush has instructed his allies to formally expel Donald Rumsfeld from the GOP, declaring that he was involved in illegal vote tampering during the 2010 Republican Primaries, and attempting to hand the election over to Communists and Fascists instead of conceding with grace. While prominent Rumsfeld-era officials have protested this action, the Former President himself remains entirely silent, knowing that his era of the GOP has come to a bitter end."

It also could not have been possible for Flordia and the wider American Republic's massive Latino-American community, which came out in droves to support Jeb Bush. From Spanish-language advertising to support from his wife Columba, Bush's appeal to Latinos is undoubtedly what put him over the edge. The President has seen it fit to return the favour in kind, proposing to Congress a bill to grant a pathway to citizens to hardworking Americans who are here illegally. The primarily Hispanic population of illegal immigrants in Florida would have a pathway to legal permenant residency after five years under this new bill. Introduced by a staunch ally in Congress, Ronald DeSantis, is a landmark step in the Republic's immigration policy, and has massivley boosted Bush's already high numbers among the Hispanic community. Bush, flanked by key allies such as DeSantis, have worked tirelessly to strangle hatred against hardworking Americans, instructing immigration enforcement agencies to ignore certain population centers, as well as radically shrinking the size of INS.

Even opponents in the Independence Union and Democratic Party frequently praise the elder Bush, even if they have to lie through their teeth to do so, only heaping praise on 'Poppy' due to political convinence. Had it not been for this widespread love for the Bush family, Jeb Bush, son of Bush Sr., would not have been able to grasp the Presidency. With Rumsfeld's corruption of the Bush family name at last at an end, we can finally restore GOP reverence of George H.W., who himself became diametrically opposed to Rumsfeld by the end of his Presidency, not-so-subtly supporting George Jr. in 2002. It is even rumoured that Rumsfeld has Bush Sr. killed in order to prevent him from formally endorsing the President's brother. While nothing is official yet, Jeb Bush has confirmed that his father was an active critic of Rumsfeld is his later years, even going so far as to call the Former President Rumsfeld 'Iron-Ass', something which Rumsfeld himself has fervently denied. Across America, veneration of the late President has risen to near cult-like levels, with new statues of H.W. being elected a breakneck pace. Every city and town in the American Republic has a high school named after the late President. Every block a street named after Bush. Even as some accuse the President of cynically apropriating his father's image to further his own popularity, the people of the American Republic remain fully on board with the state-sponsored worship of George H.W.

No ransom demands have been made, and the Commonwealth has fervently denied any role in the President's kidnapping. Given the dire circumstance, Vice President Cheney has formally been sworn in as President, with the FBI formally declaring that they have come to expect the worst. The state of lockdown in Washington D.C. is gradually being lifted as law enforcement realises that their search for Rumsfeld is ultimately hopeless. Already, preparations have been made for a State Funeral - with an empty casket being buried on behalf of an actual body. As America grieves the loss of their President, Cheney has risen as the man for the moment, promising swift and brutal revenge against those responsible for Rumsfeld's tragic demise.

Cheney has spread the rumour that Jeb Bush may be selected as Cheney's new Vice President - with the office itself being vacant after Cheney's ascension to the Presidency. Jeb Bush, eager for any scrap of power, would be salivating to accept this role, even if it's ultimately a useless ceremonial position. Jeb and Cheney have retired to the President's private ranch to discuss details. The pair were set to engage in a duck hunt, in an enjoyable occasion which would set the stage for a new era of cooperation within the GOP. Unfortunately, it seems as if this trip went south, very quickly.

The values of Conservatism have too long been polluted by the whims of men like Coe and Falwell - it's time for President Cheney to undo the decades of Evangelical brainwashing.

Indeed, with disbelief prominent Democrats such as Mary Landrieu have publicly backed Cheney in many legislative efforts, as the Christian Right-dominated Congress continues to freeze the President out. This unprecedented show of loyalty from the Democratic Party and the Independence Union is a mutually beneficial arrangement, as Cheney moves to both vassalize opposition in Congress, and take down with extreme prejudice the remaining Christian Values loyalists in the GOP caucus. Landrieu has been instrumental in the Democratic Party's Centrist shift, moving to make the American Republic's oldest party nothing more than a facade for the President's whims. While longtime Democratic opponents like Joe Biden are far from being swayed, it seems like the opposition within Congress has effectively given up. Cheney's word reigns supreme even in the world of the opposition, and even if much of the Democratic Base abhors this newfound spirit of cooperation, what are they going to do? Start their own party? We know they're smarter than to attempt such a jackass stunt, as it would only split the vote and further the GOP cause. That hasn't stopped them from trying, of course. Within the halls of power in Atlanta, opposition to Cheney's policies have virtually disappeared. However there are still demands from the Democratic side of the aisle.

People ought to be free to enter into any kind of relationship they want to'. While previously even the most liberal Democrats and Republicans only pushed for the issue of Gay Marriage to be left to the state, under Cheney's iron fist, the President has moved to tear up restrictions on Same-Sex marrige across the entirety of the American Republic. Cheney himself has publicly attended his daughter's wedding, as she marries long-time fiance Heather Poe in what is set to be one of the first official Same-Sex Marriages within the American Republic."

rw_american_republic.22.d:0 "The Democratic Party has not allowed itself to be vassalized quite so easily. While they have accepted the Cheney Administration's de-facto puppetmastering of the Democratic Party, some of the more recalcitrant Democrats have demanded more for their trouble. The Democrat Healthcare Plan, speared by Senator Landrieu, has been a particular point of contention within the halls of Congress. Cheney, in exchange for tapping down dissent within Atlanta, has signalled that he would be willing to sign off on any new healthcare plan proposed by the Democratic Party, so long as certain amendments are made. Under the President's direction, the loyalists within the GOP have moved forward with voting for the Landrieu bill. In the House, the GOP has called for an insurance subsidy plan with backing from multiple private institutions, which appears to be an acceptable compromise between Cuban-style Socialized medicine and the current Healthcare system that exists. After countless prayers and veritably shaking the Democrat's hands purple, this Bipartisan compromise, nicknamed 'Cheneycare' by many, has been passed with flying colours by both the House and the Senate. This new plan has been called a great step forward for healthcare in the American Republic, even as certain Democrat firebrands label it as nothing more than a bandaid on the issue. Regardless, any move towards reforming the American healthcare system remains popular with the general public."

rw_american_republic.23.d:0 "What is Freedom? The end of the United States has revealed many a bitter truth, the truth that the ideals which we held so dear have tragically slipped from our grasp. President Cheney now looks upon a nation, divided. The President has seen the same wicked evil that led to the end of the United States slithering through the halls of Atlanta during the Rumsfeld administration, threatening everything the President knows and loves. Cheney could not simply stand for it. An Iron Fist, wrapped in a Velvet Glove shall be our guide. Under President Cheney, the people of America shall have the freedom to be free, free from the overbearing of both Big Government and Big Religion, a nation where those in power know when to get the hell out of the way of the private lives of citizens. Conservatism, as it stands, is now truly the movement of freedom, as the authoritarian vice of the Christian Right has been excised by the steady hand of President Cheney. The Great American Khan, an angry obese Cowboy is not one to compromise, not one to surrender his values. Neither the Democrats nor the Christian Values caucus shall restrain the Commander-in-Chief from exercising his right, his duty, the sacred birthright bestowed to trample the cockroaches that fester underneath America's floorboards. The Authority of the President shall be paramount, not to menace everyday Americans, but to protect America from oblivion."

rw_american_republic.24.d:0 "Eight years since the tumultuous 2010 election, in which Donald Rumsfeld seized a slim margin of victory, the American people will once again be able to vote for their head of state. While some initially speculated that President Cheney may not seek a second eight-year term, the President publicly confirmed his candidacy earlier this year, clearing out the primary field despite fraught opposition from the GOP's Evangelical wing. The Democrats have nominated Mary Landrieu, a longtime ally of Cheney in Congress. Unlike previous elections, 2018 has proven to be remarkably free and fair, with Cheney instead moving to promote friendly Democratic leadership instead of utilizing controlled elections. The Independence Union, while continuing in Congress, has endorsed Cheney in the Presidential race instead of running their own candidate. This campaign has been a remarkably amicable one, with both Cheney and Landrieu promising to appoint their opponent to a Cabinet position if they win. Indeed, it appears that President Cheney will come out the winner in 2018 regardless of if he is re-elected or not. Polls show the GOP as a heavy favourite, but there is always a chance that Landrieu pulls off an upset. Who will prove to be the winner of the 2018 Election?"

While some initially speculated that President Cheney may not seek a second eight-year term, the President publicly confirmed his candidacy earlier this year, clearing out the primary field despite fraught opposition from the GOP's Evangelical wing. Thanks to extensive ratfucking by Republican operatives in the DNC, the Democratic Party has nominated North Carolina Senator John Edwards. Edwards, despite being a popular Democrat, is haunted by countless skeletons in his closet, making his victory unlikely. From rumours of him cheating on his cancer-ridden wife and siring an illegitimate child, to routine campaign violations, to the fact that the man comes off as a genuine Psychopath, it seems that scandal sticks to John Edwards like glue. However he is also not someone to be underestimated. His 'Two Americas' ideals and Populist tone has made the race competitive, even if the GOP continues to take measures to safeguard the elections, as they have done in the past. The Independence Union, meanwhile, has declined to run a candidate. Who will prove to be the winner of the 2018 Election?"
