 cat.1.t:0 "The Catalans Request Military Aid"
 cat.1.d:0 "In the rapidly escalating conflict on the Iberian Peninsula, the Catalan revolt continues to gain ground, but Carles Puigdemont’s coalition of separatists, anarchists, and leftist nationalists faces a formidable adversary in the Kingdom of Spain. Despite their early successes, they lack the resources to sustain a prolonged war. Now, they turn to us and our comrades in the European Union for material support, seeking weapons, supplies, and financial backing to strengthen their position. While we have tacitly backed Puigdemont’s movement during his exile, openly arming the Catalan forces would be a dramatic escalation. Aiding them could secure a valuable ally in the region and increase our influence over the Iberian peninsula, but it also risks drawing us and the European Union deeper into a potentially protracted conflict. As we deliberate, the question remains: do we commit to aiding Catalonia in its bid for independence, or do we hold back, seeking to avoid the supposed wrath of Madrid which has warned, despite being economically isolated, that any foreign intervention will be treated as an act of war?"

 cat.2.t:0 "[From.GetName] Sends Material Support"
 cat.2.d:0 "In a momentous show of support, our European allies have reaffirmed their commitment to our cause, delivering a steady flow of material assistance across the French border. Trainloads of supplies, ranging from essential provisions to military equipment, have become a lifeline for our forces, reinforcing our frontline troops and allowing us to consolidate our recent gains. This influx of aid has not only strengthened our war effort but has also deepened our ties to the European Union, a crucial step in securing international recognition for our struggle. While some may question the long-term implications of this growing dependency, for now, this support is invaluable. With Europe at our back and the Spanish State increasingly isolated, our path to victory has never been clearer. However, even as the military aid begins to replenish our frontlines, there is a palpable sense of unease among the military high command and the Provisional Generalitat, who have become increasingly concerned that such material aid, while greatly appreciated, will quickly deplete. We must utilize this equipment carefully and ensure that not a single shell, bullet, or truck is wasted."

 cat.3.t:0 "The Catalans Request Armored Support"
 cat.3.d:0 "In a request that underscores the intensity of the Catalan struggle, the provisional government in Barcelona has appealed to us for a shipment of surplus Leopard tanks, aiming to establish a functional armored corps. Their forces, largely composed of militias and hastily trained recruits, lack the expertise to operate modern armor effectively, but they insist that determination will make up for experience. The question, however, is whether this cause merits such a costly commitment. While supporting Catalonia aligns with our broader European interests and weakens Madrid’s grip on the region, providing advanced military hardware is no small step. Such a move would not only escalate tensions with Spain but could also strain our defense budget. Not only would this strain potentially cause issues, but the high command cannot shake the fact that such lack of expertise by the Catalans would require either a lengthy training regimen for their volunteers, or would mean sending German soldiers to operate these tanks, effectively dragging us into the war in Iberia."

 cat.4.t:0 "[From.GetName] Sends Armored Support"
 cat.4.d:0 "In a stroke of luck for our war effort, the German government has approved the transfer of a detachment of Leopard 1A5 tanks, their engines roaring once more in service of the Catalan cause. While these machines are far from cutting-edge, they are enough to give our forces a decisive edge on the battlefield. While initial delays over the lease of these tanks have stalled a number of advances, relief is widespread that Berlin has finally recognized that these mighty vehicles will be better served rolling through Valencia than gathering dust in a Volksarmee depot. Our crews, hastily assembled from willing volunteers and veterans of the front, have been rushed through what limited training our German comrades could provide. Now, under the banner of the newly formed Thälmann Column, named in honor of the legendary German volunteer brigade of the Spanish Civil War, these armored warriors stand ready. As these behemoths drive to the front, there has been a noted shift in the Spanish tactics, who have become wary of directly engaging our new tank columns, with Madrid seemingly realizing that the war is slowly edging in our favor."

 cat.5.t:0 "[From.GetName] Refuses to Send Armored Support"
 cat.5.d:0 "In a disappointing turn, Berlin has declined our request for Leopard 1A5 tanks, leaving our would-be armored corps without the heavy punch we had hoped for. Despite hopes of revitalizing the spirit and embracing the enduring legacy of the Thälmann Column, it appears as though the days of internationalism and solidarity against the fascist threat are long behind us, with Berlin seemingly refusing to budge on the matter, fearing their involvement would only further escalate tensions between the European Union and Madrid. Though frustrating, this setback will not deter us, our troops have fought and won without tanks before, and they will do so again if necessary. The training undertaken by our volunteer crews has not been for nothing, however. The knowledge gained will serve as the foundation for a future Catalan armored force, one that will rise when the time comes. Until then, our infantry and artillery remain our greatest strength, and it is through their tenacity that we will see this war to its victorious conclusion."

 cat.6.t:0 "Catalan Independence Parties Sign Joint Pledge"
 cat.6.d:0 "In a historic demonstration of unity, the parties of the National Popular Front, alongside the CNT, have convened in Barcelona to sign a solemn pledge of unwavering solidarity in the fight for Catalan independence. With the Estelada fluttering overhead, representatives from across the political spectrum, from republicans to socialists to anarchists, have set aside ideological differences to commit themselves wholly to the national cause. The pledge affirms that all other disputes and policy priorities shall be considered secondary to the primary struggle: the defeat of the Spanish State and the establishment of an independent Catalonia. Furthermore, it obliges the signatory factions to coordinate strategy, resolve internal disagreements through consensus, and present a unified front in the political and military spheres alike. While, at its core, a symbolic gesture, this act has already galvanized morale, demonstrating to both our people and our enemies that our movement remains resolute and that the liberation of our homeland will not be derailed by internal divisions. With unity affirmed, our collective firepower, resources, and resolve can now be directed where they belong- against Madrid’s illegitimate rule."

 cat.7.t:0 "Catalonia Requests Additional Support"
 cat.7.d:0 "At a critical juncture, we and the rest of the European Union must weigh the extent of our commitment to the Catalan cause. The provisional government in Barcelona faces mounting economic strain, struggling to maintain basic services all the while keeping its war machine running against Madrid’s forces. Supplies, according to Barcelona, dwindle, and though their forces have achieved remarkable victories, sustaining them requires external aid. We have already tied ourselves to their struggle, diplomatically, economically, and militarily, but how far can we afford to go? Military aid would bolster their battlefield strength yet risks deepening the already-existing tensions with Madrid, who have continued to maintain their saber-rattling against all our attempts to support Catalonia or any other independence movements across Iberia. However, despite this rattling, the Spanish have yet to respond to the crossing of their red lines. On the other hand, if we do not wish to further risk angering Madrid, many have instead suggested that we provide the Catalans with economic support, on the other hand, stabilizing their administration, ensuring long-term viability, and preventing further anarchy, staving off the risk of a humanitarian crisis."

 cat.8.d:0 "In a welcome show of solidarity, Europe has not turned its back on us! Following our latest appeal, the [From.GetName] has answered our call, providing crucial economic aid to keep our liberation afloat in these trying times. The war effort has placed immense strain on our industries, infrastructure, and public services, but thanks to this lifeline, we can ensure that factories continue to produce, workers continue to be paid, and essential goods reach those who need them most. This support does more than just keep the lights on, it allows us to allocate more resources to the frontlines, strengthening our forces as they continue their relentless struggle against the Spanish State. With every rifle, every shell, and every ration secured, we edge closer to victory. Though the road ahead remains uncertain, this aid has reinforced our resolve and demonstrated that our struggle is not fought in isolation. With our allies in Europe standing beside us, we push forward, determined to secure a free and sovereign Catalonia, one that will emerge from this crucible stronger than ever."

 cat.9.t:0 "[From.GetName] Sends Military Equipment"
 cat.9.d:0 "In a decisive act of solidarity, the [From.GetName] has once again proven that we do not stand alone in our struggle. Responding to our urgent call for assistance, they have generously supplied us with a fresh shipment of military matériel, ensuring that our fighters on the front lines remain well-armed and resolute. Crates of rifles, ammunition, and vital equipment now flow into our depots, fortifying our capacity to withstand the Spanish State’s relentless assaults and press forward in our quest for freedom. With this crucial lifeline secured, we can fight with renewed confidence, knowing that our arsenals will not run dry in the critical moments ahead. Every bullet, every shell, and every weapon placed in the hands of our brave soldiers strengthens our position, allowing us to resist, to push forward, and to one day triumph. Though the path to independence remains steep, this support reminds us that we are not alone. As long as our allies continue to believe in our cause, we will endure. We will fight, and we will win."

 cat.10.t:0 "Anarchists Protest Government Dependency on Warsaw Pact"
 cat.10.d:0 "Predictably, but frustrating nonetheless, our latest request for EU assistance has drawn the ire of the CNT, who view our growing reliance on Brussels as a betrayal of the Catalan revolutionary spirit. To them, each shipment of aid, each economic package, and each military resupply tightens the grip of Europe over our nascent Republic, replacing the dream of a free Catalonia with subservience to the powers of European socialism, warning, in no uncertain terms, that we are trading one master for another, swapping Madrid’s chains for Brussels’ bureaucratic yoke. Though their rhetoric remains fierce, their actions, so far, have been restrained, no sabotage, no open obstruction, but the discontent is palpable. Anarchist publications have already begun to decry the government’s “dependency mindset”. CNT organizers in the militias and local federations openly question the wisdom of seeking aid from those they view as agents of a totalitarian socialism. Yet the reality remains: without European support, this war would be unwinnable. We need weapons, funds, and infrastructure, and the CNT, for all its ideological fervor, has yet to provide an alternative."
 cat.10.o1:0 "Without European support, Barcelona may already have been occupied"
 
 cat.11.t:0 "European Advisors Arrive in Barcelona"
 cat.11.d:0 "In a much-needed development, seasoned military officers from across Europe have arrived to bolster our war effort, bringing with them the kind of battlefield expertise our forces desperately need. Among them are veterans from the French Foreign Legion, an elite force known for its experience in irregular warfare, exactly the kind of training required to mold our insurgent militias into a professional army capable of standing against the Spanish Royal Army. Until now, our war effort has been led by guerilla leaders, former police officers, and political militants, all courageous but few with real military education. While their ingenuity and determination have carried us far, the challenge ahead demands more than sheer willpower. These European officers will train our soldiers in combined-arms tactics, logistics, and proper battlefield coordination, transforming our militias from scattered volunteer brigades into a structured and disciplined force. Of course, not everyone is pleased. The CNT, ever wary of foreign influences, has voiced concerns over militarization and the erosion of local control. Whether they like it or not, however, a real army must be built, or Catalonia’s dream of independence will remain nothing more than a dream."

 cat.12.t:0 "Catalan Nationalists Mobilize in Valencia"
 cat.12.d:0 "In a troubling escalation, the Catalan insurgency has expanded beyond its traditional strongholds, as traitorous elements across rural Valencia have taken up arms against us. Local insurgents, emboldened by recent Catalan advances, have raided armories, driven out our officials, and openly declared allegiance to Puigdemont’s insurgent cabal. Their ultimate goal is clear: the fall of Valencia itself, a strategic nightmare that would make the pacification of the entire Mediterranean coast vastly more difficult. For now, the city of Valencia remains under firm Spanish control. However, with the enemy mobilizing in the countryside, it is only a matter of time before they attempt an assault. If Valencia is lost, it will shatter our defensive line along the east and bring Catalan forces dangerously close to the heart of Spain. We must act swiftly to crush this insurrection, deploying reinforcements and rooting out subversives before their rebellion can metastasize. The Catalans think they can turn Valencia against us. We must ensure that their ambitions fail."

 cat.13.t:0 "Catalan Nationalists Mobilize in the Balearic Islands"
 cat.13.d:0 "In a humiliating failure for our naval forces, the Catalan rebels have breached our blockade and successfully infiltrated the Balearic Islands. Linking up with a small number of local sympathizers, these insurgents have seized control of Menorca, establishing a foothold in what should have been an impenetrable fortress of Spanish sovereignty. This is more than just a blow to our prestige, it is a direct threat to our strategic position in the Mediterranean. If the Catalans consolidate their grip on Menorca, they may set their sights on Mallorca, where our forces would face an uphill battle to dislodge them. While we can take solace in the fact that the majority of the Balearic population remains loyal to Spain, this incursion cannot be ignored. Immediate action is necessary. We must tighten the blockade, deploy reinforcements, and prepare for a counteroffensive before this insurgency spreads. If Mallorca falls, reclaiming the islands will become exponentially more difficult. We will not allow the Catalans to turn the Balearics into their own Gibraltar."

 cat.14.t:0 "Subversives Sabotage Our Supply Lines"
 cat.14.d:0 "A wave of sabotage is sweeping across the country, striking at the very infrastructure that supports our righteous campaign to restore unity. Reports are coming in from multiple regions of rail lines being severed, supply truck tires slashed, power grids tampered with, and even communications lines disrupted, all coordinated efforts to undermine our forces and aid the Catalan insurgents. Though the full extent of the damage is still being assessed, these acts pose a serious logistical challenge, delaying reinforcements, slowing supply convoys, and frustrating our efforts to fully pacify the rebellious regions. While the enemy grows emboldened by these cowardly attacks, our security services have already begun intensive investigations to root out the saboteurs and prevent further incidents. Whether these criminals are Catalan sympathizers, radical leftists, or disloyal elements within our borders, they will be found and dealt with accordingly. This insurgency, no matter how many desperate tactics it employs, cannot and will not prevail. We will defend ourselves with unwavering resolve, and those who seek to divide our nation from within will soon learn the price of their treachery."

 cat.15.t:0 "CNT Mobilizes Further Workers' Militias"
 cat.15.d:0 "Remarkably our continued dialogue and cooperation with the CNT has paid off, solidifying their commitment to the national struggle. While our visions for the future of Catalonia may not entirely align, there is no doubt that both of our movements agree on one fundamental truth- our shared enemy remains the Spanish State. With this understanding cemented, enthusiasm among CNT ranks has surged, driving many of their most militant members to form new militias and take up arms for the cause. This influx of reinforcements is a welcome boon as we continue to resist the superior firepower and resources of Madrid’s war machine. Though our forces have fought valiantly, every additional brigade, every trained fighter, and every gun carried to the front is another step toward securing our independence. The CNT's willingness to mobilize en masse shows that, despite past tensions and disagreements, when it comes to the battlefield, we stand together as Catalans against the forces of oppression. With fresh troops pouring in and morale higher than ever, we are prepared to hold the line, and, soon, to push forward."

 cat.16.t:0 "Convergència i Unió Join the Front"
 cat.16.d:0 "In a historic breakthrough, we have finally secured the participation of the last major bloc of pro-independence forces in our provisional government. After long and difficult negotiations, requiring compromises that tested the very foundations of our socialist ideals, Artur Mas and the Convergència i Unió bloc, composed of the Democratic Convergence and the Democratic Union of Catalonia, has, at last, agreed to formally align with the National Popular Front. This marks a decisive step toward true unity in our struggle for independence. While the delicate balance of power in our government meant that reshuffling major ministries was out of the question, our new partners have nevertheless secured key roles overseeing trade and international affairs. These positions will be crucial as we look to maintain economic stability and strengthen our diplomatic standing on the world stage. Now, with every significant pro-independence faction working together under one banner, our government is as united as it can be. The divisions that once threatened to undermine our cause have been set aside. There is nothing left but to march forward and secure the independence of a free Catalan Republic!"

With the CNT acting as our bridge to the global revolutionary movement, we have drawn in fighters from near and far, all inspired by the promise of a free and equal Catalan Republic. Some come as seasoned veterans of past struggles, others as fresh recruits eager to stand against oppression, but all come with a shared commitment to our cause. These brave men and women will not fight in vain. Unlike the forgotten foreign fighters of past conflicts, we will honor their sacrifice not just in words, but in deeds. Our government has committed to paying them full military salaries, ensuring that their service is respected and rewarded. And once victory is secured, those who wish to remain among us will be granted citizenship in our young republic, making them truly one of our own. As the International Brigades once declared, so too shall we…"

 cat.18.d:0 "In a moment thick with historical echoes, Carles Puigdemont has returned to the heart of Catalonia, seizing control of the Palace of the Generalitat as Spanish forces are reeling from a wave of coordinated uprisings. With the Spanish State in full retreat, scrambling to consolidate its position, Puigdemont has sought to imprint his authority upon the unfolding rebellion, invoking the legacy of Josep Tarradellas’ return to Barcelona during Spain’s short lived democratic transition. The symbolism is deliberate, a message to the Catalans that their government is no longer an exiled entity, but a sovereign force within its very capital. Yet beyond the celebrations, the hard work begins. The nationalist forces rising across Catalonia are united in their defiance of Madrid, but remain a fragile coalition, as each group has its own vision for what independence should mean. Puigdemont, for now the undisputed face of the movement, must do more than claim power; he must keep the National Popular Front from fracturing. Moderates and radicals alike are watching, some questioning whether he can balance statecraft with the revolutionary urgency of the moment. With Spanish forces certain to return, time is against Puigdemont and his allies. What happens in these first critical days will determine not just whether we can defend our newfound authority, but whether those who fought to bring it this far can remain united in the face of the trials ahead."

 cat.19.t:0 "Guardia Civil Evacuates Political Prisoners into Spain"
 cat.19.d:0 "In a development that underscores the fragile grip of the Provisional Generalitat, barely settled into its position of power, urgent news has reached Barcelona. The Guardia Civil, still operating with impunity in parts of Catalonia, has begun transferring key prisoners out of the region. Among them are prominent figures from the National Popular Front’s parties, whose release could prove invaluable in stabilizing the nascent government. Held in the Centre Penitenciari Obert de Tarragona, they are set to be relocated into Spain unless swift action is taken. As the discussions take shape, Carles Riera has forcefully suggested an alternative: rather than focusing on political leaders, the Generalitat should prioritize liberating the militants of the independence movement, many of whom have languished in Spanish prisons for years. Their liberation, he argues, would bring battle-hardened fighters back into the fold, strengthening the resistance at a moment when every advantage is needed. Time is not on our side. With the Guardia Civil already on the move, there is no possibility of mounting both operations. The decision is now upon us: do we secure the political leadership necessary to stabilize our new government, or do we strike to free those who have fought for this cause, ensuring we have the strength to defend it?"

 cat.20.d:0 "The Provisional Generalitat moved swiftly on Tarragona, deploying militia forces to seize control of the city’s prison. The prison guards, unprepared for an organized assault, folded quickly, and while the Guardia Civil detachments put up a stiffer resistance, they too were unable to hold against the sheer determination of our forces. In a matter of hours, the prison was secured, and our political leaders, crucial to stabilizing our fledgling government, were safely extracted and returned to Barcelona. With their return, the Provisional Generalitat has a wider bench of experienced officials to call upon, reinforcing its ability to govern amid the chaos of war. Yet, as one crisis is addressed, another emerges. The CNT has openly voiced its discontent, condemning the decision to prioritize politicians over the liberation of militant workers. Multiple federations accuse the government of undue statism, with anarchist leaders arguing that power is yet again being consolidated in the hands of bureaucrats rather than those fighting and bleeding for Catalonia’s freedom."

In a swift and decisive operation, these strongholds of repression were stormed, their captives freed - not as victims, but as veterans of the struggle, hardened by years of resistance. Upon their return, they quickly organized themselves into militias to reinforce the frontlines against the inevitable Spanish counteroffensive. However, victory in Barcelona came at a cost. By the time forces could be redirected to Tarragona, the Guardia Civil had already moved the National Popular Front leaders deep into Castillean territory, placing them well beyond our reach. We will have to press forward without them, though their absence is a blow to the Provisional Generalitat’s attempts at consolidation. Yet, if history has proven anything, it is that Catalonia’s strength has always come from those willing to fight. With our ranks bolstered and our resolve unshaken, the struggle continues. The Spanish state has shown it can still maneuver, but so can we. The road ahead remains treacherous, but today’s victory ensures that when the next battle comes, we will not be facing it alone."

 cat.22.d:0 "As the Provisional Generalitat grapples with the overwhelming costs of war, the question of how to finance the ongoing struggle has become a point of intense debate. With the economy in complete disarray, most usual avenues for raising funds are unavailable, and the National Popular Front government is now forced to consider more drastic measures. Among the most contentious proposals is the idea of seizing private bank accounts. It is a radical step, one that would send a clear message to the wealthy and the Spanish loyalists that the Catalans are now in control of our home, but the more moderate factions of the coalition hesitate. Even the PSUC, typically inclined toward bold economic interventions, remains unconvinced. On the other side, the CNT has thrown its full support behind the idea, urging the Provisional Generalitat to pursue a complete and uncompromising confiscation of private assets. For them, the war presents an opportunity to not just finance the war effort but to reshape society altogether. Yet within the more moderate wing, particularly the liberal bloc Convergència i Unió, there is a push to avoid such sweeping measures, as their leaders have instead suggested the sale of war bonds as a more tempered approach, one that would appeal to international supporters and avoid alienating potential allies."

 cat.23.d:0 "The decision to seize and redistribute all wealth in Catalonia has proven far more difficult to implement than anticipated. The state apparatus, still in its infancy, cannot simply execute such a sweeping economic overhaul. Our limited bureaucratic ranks have done what they can, working alongside the banks to divert funds towards the war effort, but their efforts have been sluggish and inefficient, leaving much of the population frustrated. In the absence of a functioning state system, the CNT has stepped in, albeit in a manner far from conventional. Acting less like a legitimate governing force and more like state-sanctioned bank robbers, they have taken a far more direct approach to wealth redistribution. Their methods may be crude, but they have been effective, far more so than the bureaucrats ever could have hoped to accomplish. The money is flowing, though not in an orderly fashion, and the war effort is better funded for it. However, this radical solution has not come without its costs. While the CNT's actions may have strengthened the frontlines, they have also fueled widespread discontent. The sight of militants ransacking bank vaults, even under the banner of the Provisional Generalitat, has proven unpopular with large parts of the population, particularly among the more moderate and middle-class Catalans who are already wary of the direction the revolution is taking."

 cat.24.d:0 "As expected, the decision to redistribute the wealth of Catalonia’s elite has not been without its consequences. The wealthy, sensing the encroachment of the revolution on their lives and livelihoods, are now fleeing the city in droves. Areas like Pedralbes and Turo Park, long the bastions of the Catalan elite, are seeing luxurious estates emptied as their owners abandon their homes, choosing the risk of crossing through the frontlines into Spain rather than remain in a city where their wealth and their safety are no longer guaranteed. While the Provisional Generalitat may have only stripped their bank accounts, the fear is that the purge is not over and that further measures will follow, targeting their property, their businesses and their way of life. This fear is not entirely unfounded, as the revolutionary rhetoric of the CNT and other radical factions continues to echo, suggesting this is merely the beginning of social redistribution. The reality is that the decision has neither been an overwhelming success nor a catastrophe. The funds recovered are far from sufficient, and no one, neither the rich nor the poor, the radicals nor the moderates, is particularly happy with the outcome. Yet, in the end, perhaps this is the essence of compromise: a solution that leaves all sides dissatisfied, but which may, in its dissatisfaction, create just enough stability to keep the gears of the revolution turning."

 cat.25.d:0 "The decision to sell war bonds has provided some much-needed relief to the Provisional Generalitat’s strained treasury, helping to plug the widening gaps and secure the financial backing essential to continuing the war effort. However, it has not come without significant opposition. The CNT, ever vigilant against what they perceive as capitalist compromise, has been swift and unyielding in its denunciation of the move. They argue that the sale of bonds allows the parasites, those who have long profited from the rule of the Spanish State, to sit out the war unscathed, while the poor and oppressed are left to carry the burden of the struggle. Their rhetoric is sharp, and their protests have been fierce, with barricades blocking the banks and government offices where the sales are taking place. While the CNT's actions may limit the reach of our bond sales, their willingness to stand up for the working class cannot be easily dismissed. The revolutionary fervor that drives the anarchists is the very same energy fueling the struggle for independence. Still, this defiance presents a delicate situation for the Provisional Generalitat, as a too heavy-handed response could fracture wartime unity. At present, the struggle for victory demands compromise, even if it means appeasing factions that refuse to see the broader picture. Yet, as tensions rise and protests grow louder, the question remains: how much of this unrest can we afford before the cost of internal division outweighs the price of the war itself? The road to victory may well be paved with discomfort and compromise, but it will not be without its costs."

 cat.26.d:0 "As the war rages on, our forces have taken numerous prisoners of war, and with the growing demands of the frontline, the question of what to do with them has become more pressing. The CNT has seized upon the issue, proposing that we turn this surplus of captives into a resource for the revolution. Their idea is simple: rehabilitate these prisoners, and once they have inculcated the revolutionary precepts, offer them a place in the CNT militias. On the one hand, this solution offers a practical solution to the problem of manpower, plugging gaps in our ranks with trained soldiers who, if properly reeducated, could be loyal to the cause. The promise of integrating these prisoners of war into the revolution could also enhance the CNT’s influence, solidifying their already prominent position. On the other hand, this plan risks alarming our more moderate allies, who would see this as a dangerous strengthening of the CNT, potentially upsetting the delicate balance we’ve worked to maintain in the coalition. Additionally and more crucially, it teeters on the edge of international law, as forcibly indoctrinating and conscripting prisoners could be considered a war crime, drawing unwanted attention from external actors and tarnishing the moral high ground we’ve fought to maintain."

Despite the skepticism that some harbor, it is hard to deny that a significant number of these recruits appear to be genuine converts. Their commitment to the cause, once unimaginable, now stands as a testament to the power of anarchist propaganda and its ability to appeal to the victims of the Spanish State, no matter their nationality. It is undeniably chilling, however. These soldiers, once part of the very forces we are fighting against, are now marching in our ranks, fighting for a free Catalonia, but what kind of free Catalonia remains uncertain. While their willingness to take up arms for our cause is a boon, their ideological conversion raises pressing concerns about the direction in which they wish to take not just Catalonia, but all of Iberia, in. The CNT, with its vision of a stateless, decentralized society, may be welcoming them with open arms, but what kind of freedom will they be fighting for once the war ends?

The conditions are far from ideal, and despite our best efforts, the situation is teetering on the edge of chaos. In desperation, we have been forced to request aid from international humanitarian organizations, hoping that their expertise and resources can alleviate some of the pressure. On one hand, this move has provided an invaluable lifeline, bringing in much-needed relief that has reassured our international backers. The assistance, though not a cure-all, has bolstered our credibility on the world stage, and it seems that the credibility of our cause remains strong enough to secure more backing. Our diplomatic efforts, it seems, have paid off. However, the CNT is far from pleased with this course of action. Their long standing stance has been clear: we must fully embrace revolutionary principles, and part of that, they argue, is taking control of these camps without outside intervention or compromises. Their frustration lies in the fact that we did not heed their calls to make these camps productive, as they believed we could maintain a more robust system without relying on the very international institutions that, to them, represent capitalist influence."

 cat.29.t:0 "Municipal Governments Come into Conflict with the CNT "
 cat.29.d:0 "As we consolidate our rule amid the chaos of war, we find ourselves grappling with the problem of dual power. In many areas, particularly in rural municipalities, there is a notable clash between the elected local governments, both those that existed before and after the declaration of independence, and the CNT federations. The points of contention are both numerous and seemingly mundane: who organizes trash collection, who maintains the water and power supply, and who is responsible for law enforcement? The conflict is no trivial matter. The municipal governments argue that they are the legitimate authority, having been elected by the people, some even after independence was declared. On the other hand, the CNT, driven by its revolutionary principles, claims the right to oversee these functions as part of its broader vision for a decentralized, worker-run society. The problem, however, is that neither side is willing to yield, and the lack of clear authority is undermining the basic functions of the state. We stand at a crossroads. We could make a decisive choice, backing either the municipal governments or the CNT federations, but doing so risks fracturing the fragile unity we have managed to maintain. The alternative is to set up organs for joint organization, effectively kicking the can down the road and postponing this fundamental issue until after the war is won. Although this may prove to be a temporary remedy, it is uncertain if it will prove to be anything more than a temporary solution."

 cat.30.d:0 "Despite the provisional Generalitat’s decision to stand by the Municipal Government, the CNT has not simply folded in the face of the decision. While they are not actively fighting us, their strategy seems to be one of persistent disruption, making things as difficult as possible for the municipal governments at every turn. Whether it's hindering bureaucratic functions, impeding resource distribution, or blocking initiatives they see as counter to their vision, the CNT’s interference is undeniable. Adding to the complexities, there are widespread reports of non-compliance from the municipal police forces scattered across Catalonia. Police chiefs, especially in rural areas, are broadly reporting inadequate resources to carry out their duties, a likely consequence of the chaotic dismantling of the Guardia Civil and the resulting vacuum in law enforcement. It is clear that the power vacuum, compounded by the CNT’s influence, is straining the already fragile municipal institutions. The hope, however, is that these tensions are temporary and that once the immediate challenges of the war and the political instability are addressed, the issue of dual power will begin to resolve itself.  The CNT’s persistence, while not an outright rebellion, suggests that their vision continues to be far from aligned with the more moderate, traditional structures of governance we are attempting to uphold. It remains to be seen whether we can navigate this tension long enough to maintain order and ensure the survival of the Generalitat, or if this simmering conflict will eventually boil over."

 cat.31.t:0 "Joint Administrative Commissions Temporarily Established across Liberated Territory"
 cat.31.d:0 "In the face of mounting tension and the increasingly apparent dual power struggle, the provisional Generalitat has elected to take a pragmatic approach. The solution, while not perfect, was simple: the establishment of Joint Administrative Commissions across Catalonia, where both the CNT Federations and the municipal governments could come together to address the issues that had been stalling progress. By providing a platform for these two competing forces to meet, the aim is to allow for a dialogue that would, at least, prevent the situation from escalating further. The commissions, of course, have not been without their challenges. Bureaucratic delays and inefficiencies are rampant, as the two sides attempt to navigate the complexities of cooperation while also upholding their respective ideals. Yet, despite the common gridlock and the begrudging nature of their participation, the CNT and the municipal governments have made progress. Conflicts that once seemed insurmountable have been resolved through these commissions, and a working relationship, though far from harmonious, has at least been established. While it may not be the decisive resolution to the issue of dual power that we had hoped for, it is, for now, a workable solution. The fact that both groups are willing to engage, even if reluctantly, is an accomplishment in itself. Though the bureaucratic challenges continue to grow, there is a sense of cautious optimism that this collaborative framework will hold long enough for us to address the more pressing challenges that lie ahead."

The race is defined by four major contenders, each vying for control. On the left, the Republican Left of Catalonia seeks to seize leadership of the progressive bloc, presenting itself as the legitimate heir to historic Catalan governments. With a broad left-wing platform, it has targeted both the progressive middle class and radical leftists, using the PSUC’s recent internal chaos to position itself as the stabilizing force of the left. But Carles Puigdemont’s PSUC is still a major contender, leveraging his status as the victorious war leader. While officially a socialist party, the PSUC’s current campaign tone leans heavily on nationalism, de-emphasizing traditional socialist rhetoric in favor of a left-wing nationalist vision. On the right, the CiU stands as the liberal nationalist heavyweight, appealing to Catalonia’s economic elite while pushing for political and economic reforms, but always with a staunch nationalist core. Lastly, Citizens of Catalonia enters the fray as a pro-Spanish alternative, transcending class lines to represent those who feel left out of the independence movement, while also advocating for a clear liberal economic agenda to reach beyond language politics."

 cat.232.d1:0 "Despite abolishing the nation-state, the federations of the Free Confederation of Catalonia are struggling to discard all of its trappings. Among the latest debates rocking the Confederal Plenary Assembly is whether to adopt an official anthem, a unifying song to embody the spirit of the revolution and solidarity with the people. Though the adoption of an anthem would continue to evoke the image of state oppression, the proposals suggested have, despite continued hostility, been largely embraced by lay members of the Federation. Hijos del Pueblo, a rousing anthem of liberation and hope could stand as a continued reminder of what the revolution stood for, not merely struggle, but the birth of a new, free society. However, the militant federations have argued that such optimism is premature, for the world continues to be ensnared in the chains of oppression and so much of the fight still lies ahead. As a result, these federations have proposed A Las Barricadas, a song of defiance and unyielding resistance, and a song already used by anarchist movements across the globe. However, such violent rhetoric within the song will do little to separate the new Confederation from our past, symbolizing a seemingly never-ending revolution."
 cat.232.d2:0 "With the formation of an independent Catalan state now a reality, the matter of a national anthem has sparked intense discussion within government circles as we now seek to define ourselves in a world ready to embrace our Republic. Two historic hymns have traditionally been used by supporters of the Catalan cause: Els Segadors and Cant de la Senyera. While Els Segadors enjoys widespread popularity, its origins from the Corpus de Sang, a peasant's revolt that led to the escalation of the Reapers' War, discomforts many liberal and conservative voices. Additionally, Unionist figures argue that its overtly anti-Spanish lyrics could alienate portions of the population and complicate any future relations with Spain, should we ever seek to restore our ties. As an alternative, these same voices have proposed Cant de la Senyera, which, while still patriotic, lacks the militant undertones of Els Segadors and instead highlights themes of unity and pride, representing a more neutral, civic, style of nationalism. While this choice would help cement a non-partisan identity for our new state, its rejection of the revolutionary struggle fought by our brave fighters has done little to sway the supporters of Els Segadors.

The liberal bloc is finding itself increasingly marginalized, with very few members of their ideological bent counting themselves among the ranks of the CNT. Worse still, many liberal officials have been turned away or outright rejected, branded as bourgeois roaders, or accused of harboring reactionary tendencies, fuelling further division. These grievances have found a sympathetic ear within the National Popular Front, particularly among the ERC, who share the concerns of the liberal bloc. The discontent among these groups is growing louder as they see the CNT’s revolutionary zeal as a threat to the broader coalition, and more importantly, to the principles of democratic governance.

If we are to maintain the support of the people in these critical moments, action is no longer optional, it is imperative. One option is to introduce regulations, a formal code of conduct that would curb the worst excesses while allowing the militias to retain their autonomy. This would placate civilians without fully antagonizing the anarchists, but there’s no guarantee the CNT would even acknowledge our authority to impose such guardrails. The other path is far more drastic, nationalizing the militias, bringing them under government control, and integrating them into the proper command structure. This would end their unilateral actions, but it would also mean provoking the CNT at a time when their armed strength remains vital to the war effort. The backlash could be severe, and with the fragile unity of the National Popular Front already under strain, we must ask: can we afford another internal battle while the Spanish State still looms at our borders?"

The election was swiftly organized, and the CNT’s choice was clear. Fidel Manrique, a veteran militant with a long history of revolutionary struggle, has now taken his seat on the board. While there has been some grumbling among the CNT’s more hardline members, the arrangement remains a broad success. Complaints from civilians have dropped significantly as the militias, now bound by clear rules of engagement and a code of conduct, have begun exercising a measure of restraint in their interactions with the public. Their autonomy remains intact, but with a level of oversight that ensures they remain an asset to the war effort rather than a liability. For now, at least, tensions have been defused, and the National Popular Front can turn its attention back to the battlefield rather than internal disputes.

Do the rulings of the Provisional Generalitat take precedence? What might have been an isolated issue has quickly escalated into another major point of contention between the factions of the National Popular Front. The liberals, already wary of the CNT’s unchecked power, argue that this chaos is precisely why a firm legal framework must be established now, not later. The CNT, on the other hand, is furious at the idea of their militants being dragged before courts they do not recognize, seeing it as an attack on their autonomy and a betrayal of the wartime alliance.

What was supposed to be a step toward consolidating our forces has resulted in widespread non-compliance and simmering resentment within the CNT’s ranks. Though they continue to fight against the Spanish State, it is clear that our attempt to assert control over their forces has backfired. Their leadership has openly denounced what they call an authoritarian overreach, accusing the government of betraying the principles of the revolution. Some formations have gone so far as to refuse logistical cooperation with government forces, claiming that they will fight their own way. Others, while less confrontational, have simply taken to dragging their feet at every turn, making coordination a nightmare. The result is a fractured front at a time when we can least afford it. Without the anarchist militias fully integrated into the war effort, key operations are jeopardized, and the strain on our alliance is becoming untenable.

In a report detailed to the Generalitat, Josep Lluís Trapero Álvarez has proclaimed that while nearly half of the economy has been socialized, the anarchist federations refuse to acknowledge centralized authority. They continue to regularly override management decisions, both in private and public enterprises and in many regions, they have become the de facto government, challenging the legitimacy of the Provisional Generalitat.

The division has come to a head over the drafting of the constitution. Nuet and his allies are demanding provisions that enshrine the leading role of the National Popular Front in Catalonia’s future, a move that Puigdemont refuses to endorse. Instead, he has signaled a willingness to work with Convergència i Unió and other factions to draft a broad, liberal democratic constitution rather than one rooted in strict socialist principles.

Economic and social rights proved to be the most divisive subject, with fierce debates over the extent of state intervention and welfare guarantees. While the PSUC’s hardliners demanded a stronger role for the state, more moderate voices, including Carles Puigdemont and his allies, advocated a balanced approach that would secure reasonable social welfare and room for interventionism without disallowing private business entirely. Ultimately, a compromise was reached, with a guarantee of basic social protections while still preserving a market-oriented economic structure. Though most of the PSUC fell in line, a handful of dissidents from its communist wing voted against the final draft in protest, objecting to what they viewed as an abandonment of revolutionary principles.

Drawing support from both the left and right, effectively branding itself as a centrist political party on most social and economic issues, the Citizens of Catalonia movement has incorporated elements from the Socialist Party of Catalonia, as well as pragmatic conservatives. While firmly acknowledging Catalonia’s status as an independent nation, Citizens of Catalonia sets itself apart from the dominant nationalist parties by advocating for a pluralistic vision of Catalan identity, one that affirms the Spanish linguistic and cultural heritage within the republic.

Nuet, resisting until the bitter end, had to be forcibly removed from the premises after refusing to accept the outcome of the vote. Regardless of the continued opposition by Nuet's faction, who have unsurprisingly denounced Puigdemont, the deed is done. While this move risks alienating a small faction of die-hard communists, Puigdemont’s popularity and the PSUC's strong parliamentary standing position have meant that the purge has done little to radically shake the balance of power. In response, Nuet and his allies founded the Communists of Catalonia, a hardline socialist party intent on maintaining the principles they believed Puigdemont abandoned. However, early projections suggest that their influence will be limited to a handful of seats at best, leaving Puigdemont’s PSUC uncontested as the dominant force of the Catalan left heading into the elections."

Recognizing the perilous path ahead, Puigdemont has firmly rejected calls for coercion and instead opted for negotiations. In a move that will undoubtedly infuriate the hardline faction, he has reached out to the CiU leadership in an effort to forge a compromise between the two coalitions. The discussions will center on balancing socialist principles with economic flexibility, ensuring both a strong welfare state and a viable market economy. However, this course of action will have consequences.

While the Communists of Catalonia lack the numbers to significantly disrupt governance, their defiant rhetoric and early momentum suggest that they will not simply fade away.

Now, with our rule cemented beyond question, we can finally turn our focus to the monumental task of building socialism. The constitution is secure, the mandate clear, and the path to progress lies ahead. As we embark upon the reconstruction of Catalonia, our vision of a socialist republic stands firm and undaunted by reactionary forces."

 cat.283.d:0 "The Provisional Generalitat has, in a desperate bid to combat anarchist dual power and restore centralized control issued a sweeping decree affirming the right to public property. Under the new law, property holders have been granted the undisputed right to organize and manage their properties as they see fit within the confines of the legal framework. The decree, while bold and necessary, is unlikely, however, to fully resolve the issue of dual power. The anarchist federations have already shown a willingness to disregard central directives, and their entrenched influence in key industries and communities remains a formidable obstacle. Nevertheless, by reasserting the Generalitat’s commitment to orderly governance, the decree aims to prevent economic paralysis and keep the gears of society turning. Negotiating a lasting resolution with the CNT will undoubtedly prove arduous, with or without their assent to this latest measure. Still, the government hopes that the pragmatism of keeping society functioning will outweigh any ideological resistance. Whether the anarchists will comply or continue their defiant stance remains uncertain, but for now, the foundation for state authority has been laid."

The anarchist federations, deeply embedded across the Republic, have swiftly mobilized to block government officials from enforcing the new regulations, setting the stage for a potential confrontation that few seem eager to face. The decree, intended to reassert public management rights and stabilize the economy, has instead fueled resentment and sharpened tensions between the revolutionary factions. Inside the Generalitat, voices are already calling for mobilization to reestablish state authority by force, a prospect that looms ominously over the fragile peace. Yet, there are also calls for caution and dialogue, recognizing that another outbreak of bloodshed could cripple our fledgling Republic and shatter any semblance of unity. As tensions mount, we must now reckon with the reality of our weakened grip on power. Whether to escalate militarily or seek compromise is an agonizing choice that could define the fate of post-war Catalonia.

Across the Republic, the anarchist federations have moved decisively, with the western half of the country already under CNT control, centered around the uprising in Lleida. There, CNT militias have swiftly consolidated power, declaring the region liberated from what they decry as state capitalist oppression. Yet, the eastern half of the country tells a different story. Although Barcelona has devolved into a bloody battlefield, our forces have maintained a tenuous hold, while the North East remains firmly loyal to the provisional government. The Provisional Generalitat, caught between consolidating power and quelling the rebellion, now faces the grim necessity of crushing the CNT by force.

With Western Catalonia now firmly in CNT hands, the anarchist militias have wasted no time consolidating their newfound power. Revolutionary committees have begun dislodging government administrators and suspected loyalists, replacing them with local federation delegates. The CNT’s victory in Lleida marks a significant blow to our ability to maintain authority west of Barcelona, as revolutionary fervor sweeps through towns and villages. The retreating government forces, battered and demoralized, now race to regroup with the Barcelonan detachments, seeking to fortify the remaining loyalist territories.

Government forces are still mopping up residual CNT elements in the city's sprawling suburbs, leaving critical gaps in the capital's defenses. Desperate to plug the holes, units from Girona are being rushed southward, their convoy lights stretching into the night, while military command burns through mountains of coffee in frenzied strategy sessions. There is a palpable sense of urgency and dread permeating government corridors, as commanders work to cobble together a cohesive defense amid the chaos. In contrast, the CNT militias advance with determination, eager to strike while the Generalitat remains disorganized and stretched thin.

The anarchist fighters, though fiercely determined, found themselves outnumbered, outgunned, and strategically outmaneuvered. As the trap closed around them, panic spread through their ranks, and their formation buckled under the relentless assault. Only a few managed to break free, retreating in disarray toward Lleida, while the shattered remnants were overrun and captured. With the CNT’s advance decisively broken, Barcelona is no longer in imminent peril, and the Provisional Generalitat breathes a collective sigh of relief.

As our forces broke through to the city center, chaos erupted within the CNT ranks. Conflicting orders from the anarchist leadership left many militants disoriented and leaderless and faced with overwhelming firepower, hundreds surrendered, laying down arms despite the radical factions’ calls to fight to the last. Though pockets of resistance remain, our forces are swiftly neutralizing holdouts, determined to eradicate any trace of CNT authority and restore full governmental control.

While the CiU’s support throughout the civil war proved invaluable, they have reacted with measured disapproval to this latest move, uneasy about the consolidation of power. Yet, with the people weary of bloodshed and strife, there is scant appetite for resistance or political squabbles. The streets of Barcelona, Lleida, and Girona lie quiet, not from fear, but from an exhaustion that has settled like dust after a long, harsh storm.

The strike’s reach is total, as workers of all industries have heeded the call, leaving government officials scrambling to maintain basic functions. With paperwork piling up and transit paralyzed, even the most routine tasks become insurmountable challenges. The economy has shuddered to a halt, and the beating heart of Catalonia’s cities is stilled, filled only with the rhythmic chants of those demanding an entirely new order. The Generalitat’s response remains uncertain, with some advocating conciliation, while others insist on decisive action to break the strike.

In many cases, law enforcement has simply faded into the background, surrendering to the reality that the Generalitat’s authority is fading by the hour.

Images of Puigdemont leaving his capital, hurriedly captured by journalists, have circulated like wildfire and have struck a heavy blow to loyalist morale, with some officers already deserting or surrendering to the CNT. Forced to recognize the anarchy taking hold of our once promising revolution, the European Union has taken notice, with envoys already offering safe evacuation for Puigdemont and his government.

This cannot stand. While we do not wish to imperil our alliance with the CNT, already fragile and volatile, we must reassert control over these industries before their actions cripple our ability to wage war. The National Popular Front must now decide how firm a stance to take, whether to negotiate and risk appearing weak or to act decisively and provoke a confrontation.

One by one, their committees and battalions have reluctantly voted to reaffirm their commitment to the Provisional Generalitat, recognizing that division only strengthens the Spanish State. Though the ideological wounds will take time to heal, the reality is clear, there is no room for internal squabbles when independence itself is on the line. The CNT’s surviving forces, now devoid of leadership and direction, have pledged their full effort toward the war, refocusing on fighting the Spanish State rather than their fellow Catalans. This turn of events marks the end of an unnecessary and costly distraction. No more internal strife, no more wasted resources, only the war remains. With our focus fully restored, the path is clear: rally our forces, consolidate our gains, and strike with renewed vigor to achieve what we set out to do from the beginning- win Catalonia’s freedom!"

 cat.311.d:0 "Our forces have triumphantly entered Palma, raising the Estelada high above Bellver Castle in a resounding symbol of our growing strength. The liberation of the Balearic capital marks a critical milestone in our campaign, demonstrating that even in the face of immense adversity, we are capable of striking deep into occupied territory and securing decisive victories against the Spanish State. Yet, for all its strategic and symbolic importance, our arrival in Palma has not been met with the same euphoria that swept through Catalonia’s liberated towns. The Balearic Islands, long peripheral to the Catalan national struggle, remain wary of our presence, their residents hesitant and, at times, outright indifferent to our cause. While no open hostility has emerged, it is clear that we are regarded more as foreign occupiers than brothers-in-arms. Nonetheless, our priority now is to consolidate this hard-won success. Entrenchment efforts are already underway as our forces reinforce Palma and fortify key positions across the islands in anticipation of the inevitable Spanish counteroffensive. Holding Mallorca will not be easy, Madrid will not tolerate the loss of such a strategic position without a fight, but for now, we celebrate. Against the odds, we have proven that our revolution is not confined to the mainland. The struggle for Catalonia’s future presses on, and with each victory, we edge closer to the final reckoning"

With the city firmly under our control, we have struck a major blow against the Spanish State’s hold over the region, bringing us one step closer to the unification of the Països Catalans. Yet, as our troops parade through the streets, the reception has been mixed. While many have greeted our forces as liberators, waving Senyeres and Estelades in defiance of Madrid, others have watched in silence or scorn. The deep roots of Blaverism, long cultivated by the Spanish State to drive a wedge between Catalonia and Valencia, remain visible in the streets of Castello de la Plana. Decades of propaganda have left too many Valencians wary of our cause, seeing our forces not as liberators but as intruders. Despite these divisions, the strategic value of our advance is undeniable. With Castelló secured, the door to Valencia City itself stands open. The Spanish army will not take this loss lightly, and we must brace for a counteroffensive, but for now, we press forward. The dream of a unified Països Catalans is no longer a distant aspiration, it is a reality in the making."

 cat.313.d:0 "After fierce battles through the treacherous mountain passes and tunnels of Andorra, our forces have finally reached Andorra la Vella, weary but victorious. The last Catalan state, long absorbed into the Spanish monarchy, has now been restored to our control. In purely strategic terms, this is a triumph, the Pyrenees offer us a formidable natural barrier, securing our northern flank and creating a vital connection to France. Yet, as with every advance in this war, political realities complicate the victory. Our arrival has been met with evident skepticism. Andorran society, long insulated from the struggles of the heartland, remains largely sympathetic to the royal regime, a legacy of decades of economic and political integration with Madrid. While some have welcomed us as liberators, others eye our presence with apprehension, seeing our forces as occupiers rather than compatriots. Complicating matters further, representatives of the Grand Council of the Valleys, the historic governing body of Andorra, have approached us with a request: they wish to continue their legislative functions under our authority. On the one hand, allowing them to operate could help win over the Andorran public , giving the impression of continuity rather than occupation. On the other hand, we cannot be certain of their loyalties, and thus it may be easier to deny it the right to assemble."

 cat.314.t:0 "Government Officials Preside over Reconvention of the General Council of the Valleys"
 cat.314.d:0 "To secure Andorra’s stability while maintaining our authority, we have allowed the Grand Council of the Valleys to reconvene, on the condition that its members swear allegiance to the Catalan state. With envoys of the Provisional Generalitat overseeing proceedings, the council assembled without incident, focusing primarily on the reconstruction after the battles that saw Andorra liberated. Roads, bridges, and essential infrastructure have been damaged, and despite political tensions, even the most skeptical council members recognize the urgency of restoring normalcy. Yet, beneath the surface, unease lingers. Many council members have refused to take the oath, their absences conspicuous in the chamber. Even among those who did pledge loyalty, their words ring hollow, spoken out of necessity rather than conviction. Their faces betrayed resentment, and their measured tones suggested reluctance rather than commitment. It is clear that for many Andorrans, our presence remains an imposition rather than a homecoming. The Grand Council is functional for now, but trust is scarce. The question remains whether this institution will evolve into a genuine partner in governance or serve as a façade, one we tolerate only for the sake of short-term stability."

 cat.315.t:0 "Occupational Authority Established in Andorra"
 cat.315.d:0 "In a decisive move to secure the northern front, our government has rejected the entreaties of the Andorran leadership and imposed military rule over the valleys. While this measure has drawn considerable ire from local inhabitants, many of whom remain skeptical of our cause, the need for absolute control in wartime leaves us with little alternative. The Grand Council of the Valleys, which once presided over Andorra’s affairs, has been suspended indefinitely, its members dismissed or placed under surveillance to prevent any collaboration with Madrid. We have assured the Andorran people that their democratic rights will be restored upon the successful conclusion of the War of Liberation, though such guarantees have done little to temper discontent. Resentment is palpable, but geography is on our side. Andorra's rugged terrain, once a battlefield, now serves as a natural barrier against Spanish infiltration. Any stragglers or sympathizers hoping to stir resistance in the mountains will find no refuge; our forces are firmly entrenched, prepared to eliminate any threat to Catalan sovereignty from within. Though our occupation may be viewed with suspicion, Barcelona can rest assured that Andorra will not become a dagger at our backs. Stability, not sentiment, dictates our course, and in war, such choices must be made."

The Estelada now flies over the Turia, a symbol of our determination and the resilience of our struggle. Though we encounter familiar challenges, and lingering resistance from elements influenced by Blaverism and the logistical strains of occupation, this victory has irreversibly shifted the balance of power. With much of the eastern coast now in our hands and unrest mounting within Spain, the prospect of Madrid seeking terms grows ever more likely. The Spanish State reels from its failures on the battlefield, its ability to maintain the war effort increasingly in doubt. While we cannot count on an immediate settlement, the strategic momentum is undeniably ours. Within Catalonia, this triumph has galvanized support for the Provisional Generalitat, proving that our political project is no mere dream but a tangible force capable of reshaping history. The path to full liberation remains fraught with challenges, but with every city we reclaim, our vision of a free and united Catalonia draws closer to reality."

Despite its distance from Catalonia proper and the deep-rooted influence of Blaverism among the local population, Alacant has fallen into our hands, marking yet another victory in the ongoing War of Liberation. The Estelada now flies proudly over the city, a defiant symbol of our resolve. Though the local sentiment remains divided, many here feeling disconnected from their Catalan roots, the military presence and the political strength of our cause continue to grow. This victory solidifies our hold on the eastern coast and strengthens the legitimacy of the Provisional Generalitat as the rightful government of all Catalonia. The road ahead may be fraught with challenges as we work to win the hearts and minds of those who view our struggle with suspicion. But the capture of Alacant proves that no part of the Països Catalans is beyond our reach, and with each passing day, we move closer to our goal of complete liberation from the Spanish State."

 ###National Focuses###
 CAT_2_call_the_eu:0 "Call Upon the EU"
 CAT_2_call_the_eu_desc:0 "The struggle for independence is on, and it is clear that we must turn to our European benefactors if we wish to defeat the Spanish State. The support of the European Union has been invaluable thus far, and with just a little bit more, we can finally have a free and independent Catalonia."
 CAT_2_request_german_armour:0 "Request German Armor"
 CAT_2_request_german_armour_desc:0 "The lumbering tanks of the Spanish State are the one enemy our brave freedom fighters struggle the most to overcome, but our ties to the EU may provide us the remedy. If the Castilian oppressors wish to field tanks, then let us call upon the finest tank-makers on the continent. German armor shall return to Iberia, this time in the name of liberty!"
 CAT_2_deepen_ties_pact:0 "Deepen Ties to the Pact"
 CAT_2_deepen_ties_pact_desc:0 "Our struggle continues, and it seems like we may need more material than we can currently muster. Whatever support the European Union may wish to give us, we need to acquire, even if it may come at a cost. Independence is worth any price."
 CAT_2_form_provisional_government:0 "Form a Provisional Government"
 CAT_2_form_provisional_government_desc:0 "The broad alliance of forces in the liberation movement may have been sufficient to rally our forces, but as we continue to fight for freedom, we need a more proper government to represent the will of the people, both domestically and internationally. The PSUC shall establish a proper, provisional government of the National Popular Front, which will be responsible for leading Catalonia to victory and beyond."
 CAT_2_peoples_commisariat_liberation:0 "People's Commissariat for Liberation"
 CAT_2_peoples_commisariat_liberation_desc:0 "The fight against the Spanish State is our utmost priority at the moment, and as such must receive more direct attention. For the duration of the war only, a special People’s Commissariat shall be established to ensure that all the resources of our state are directed towards the liberation, with power superseding all other ministries, and headed only by the most stalwart of loyalists."
 CAT_2_call_valencians_to_arms:0 "Call Our Valencian Brothers to Arms"
 CAT_2_call_valencians_to_arms_desc:0 "Though we may hold the Catalan heartland, the Catalan nation extends far beyond the borders of the historic region of Catalonia. The Catalans of Valencia feel the Castilian boot as much as we do, and if we only send them a little support, we can not just open a second front against the Spanish State, but potentially win freedom for all the Països Catalans."
 CAT_2_infiltrate_baleares:0 "Infiltrate the Balearic Islands"
 CAT_2_infiltrate_baleares_desc:0 "The Catalans on the Balearic Islands have long chafed under Castilian tyranny and propaganda, so much that they have been isolated from our struggle. Nevertheless, we have enough connections on the islands that we can ferry in a handful of troops who will herald the national reawakening of the Balearic people!"
 CAT_2_rally_united_front:0 "Rally the United Front"
 CAT_2_rally_united_front_desc:0 "If Catalonia is to become independent, we need to make sure that all sovereigntist forces are united. Carles Puigdemont will lean upon his long-standing ties with the broader liberation movement to bring the National Popular Front into a broad, nationalist alliance. Divided we are weak, but united we may triumph."
 CAT_2_learn_from_basque:0 "Learn From the Basques"
 CAT_2_learn_from_basque_desc:0 "Our Basque compatriots practically wrote the handbook for successful struggle against the Spanish State, and if we are to win our independence, taking a few lessons from them can only be of benefit. The streets of Lleida, of Girona, of Tarragona and everywhere else will become practically impassable for the forces of the tyrant Felipe!"
 CAT_2_utilize_castillians:0 "Utilize Castillian Sympathizers"
 CAT_2_utilize_castillians_desc:0 "Few in number, there are nevertheless those among the Castilians who likewise believe in Catalan self-determination, and are willing to support our efforts! Let us link up with these and help coordinate their efforts, so that the Spanish State may not even feel safe on its own home turf."
 CAT_2_tolerate_cnt_fai:0 "Tolerate CNT-FAI Communes"
 CAT_2_tolerate_cnt_fai_desc:0 "The War of Liberation would never have gotten this far had it not been for the support of the CNT-FAI. Though their anarcho-syndicalist ideals are distant from the rest of our united front, the respect they command among the industrial workers is invaluable, and their militants would make a fine addition to our frontline troops."
 CAT_2_unity_all_costs:0 "Unity Above All Else"
 CAT_2_unity_all_costs_desc:0 "The greatest danger towards independence is not the Castilian imperialists, but division in our own ranks. Even the Liberals wish to see an independent Catalonia, and thus must be included in our ranks. As long as we can all stick together, the May Days of 1937 will never be repeated!"
 CAT_2_reinvigorate_interbrigades:0 "Revive the Interbrigades"
 CAT_2_reinvigorate_interbrigades_desc:0 "Our cause has many supporters both near and far, and with the international connections of both the Revolutionary Left and the Anarchists, we can bolster our ranks with volunteers from near and far who all wish to strike a blow against the Fascist regime in Madrid. For our freedom and for yours!"
 CAT_2_rally_all_people:0 "Rally All Our People"
 CAT_2_rally_all_people_desc:0 "The cause of freedom demands yet more sacrifices. If we wish to see a free and independent Catalonia, we need everyone to do their parts, to work, to fight, to sweat, and to bleed, so that we may one day see the Estelada fly freely over every corner of our lands, from north to south!"
 CAT_call_the_eu:0 "Call Upon the EU"
 CAT_call_the_eu_desc:0 "The struggle for independence is on, and it is clear that we must turn to our European benefactors if we wish to defeat the Spanish State. The support of the European Union has been invaluable thus far, and with just a little bit more, we can finally have a free and independent Catalonia."
 CAT_request_german_armour:0 "Request German Armor"

 POLITICS_CARLES_PUIGDEMONT_DESC:0 "Coming from a family of Catalan nationalists, Carles Puigdemont is but the last of many who have fought for an independent Catalonia. Born and raised in the village of Amer, Puigdemont joined underground Catalan youth groups already in his teenage years. At the same time, he lived an unassuming public life as a journalist at the local news paper, using its facilities to also run his own underground newspaper, El Punt. But his involvement in the independence struggle only grew. Eventually coming into contact with the Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia, Puigdemont was convinced that Catalonia's best chances for independence lay with the European Union. Coming from a family of business owners, Puigdemont was never the Communist stalwart, but he joined the party nevertheless. Rising in the ranks speedily thanks to his management of El Punt, Puigdemont joined the Politburo already at the age of 33 in 1995. Through connections established through the newspaper, the Unified Socialists were able to tighten relations with other separatist groups, like the Workers' Front and the exiled Republican Left, unifying the separatist left. But as time went by, the price on his head grew, and eventually, he and the other leaders of the separatist movement were ratted out. In a daring raid by Spanish authorities upon a resistance meeting, most of its leadership were captured. Puigdemont, however, managed to escape to Brussels, from where he has been the de-facto leader of the Catalan separatist movement since. And now, in a historic echo, the Catalans are once more taking up arms. Once, they struck at their foes with their sickles, as the anthem Els Segadors alludes to. Now, under his leadership, they will strike with both hammer and sickle. The culmination of his life's work is about to begin."
