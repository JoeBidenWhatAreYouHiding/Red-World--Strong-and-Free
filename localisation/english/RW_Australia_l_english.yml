  POLITICS_AST_JULIA_GILLARD_DESC:0 "Julia Gillard has been a controversial figure in Australian politics for years, consistently using outlandish statements on the campaign trail to garner unprecedented support within disillusioned voters. Formerly a member of the defunct People's Alternative, a revolutionary socialist party, Gillard has shifted further to the right in the past thirty years, joining Labor in 1989. She was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1998, becoming Shadow Agriculture Minister in 2001. By the time cracks in the Liberal-National Coalition's began to show, she had risen to the position of Deputy Party Leader. And upon Labor's landslide loss to a reinvigorared Liberal-National government in 2007, she was selected to succeed her mentor John Brumby as party leader. This new coalition government would not last however, as a snap election was held not even a year later, where Gillard and her party claimed an unprecedented victory, being elected Prime Minister with an overwhelming majority of seats. However, in recent months her popularity has plunged due to a worsening economic crisis and a growing rift with the Governor General. Australia's first female Prime Minister will have to battle against all odds to maintain her position until the next federal election."

  AST_Civil_War_Legacy:0 "Legacy of the Civil War"
  AST_Civil_War_Legacy_desc:0 "The Australian Civil War of 1985 marks the first ever instance of modern conflict on the continent of Oceania. The CPA, seeing their opportunity to strike in the wake of the United States' collapse, declared that the reign of Capitalist tyranny in the Antipodes was all but over. The CPA's declared a 'Million Man March' on Canberra, with the final goal being to replace the government of Prime Minister Bob Hawke with a Communist Regime loyal to Moscow. While they expected the now-isolated Labour government to quickly fold, or at least to negotiate with the CPA strikers, their march was stopped dead in their tracks by both local police and the federal army, who were terrified beyond measure that Australia may fall to Communism in a similar fashion to governments in Western Europe. This escalating series of violent events eventually led to the declaration of the 'Australian Workers Republic' in Perth, and an attempt by the CPA to violently overthrow the federal government with assistance from China and the Soviet Union. This effort, while ultimately futile, shook the nation to its very core. The fact that not even Australia was safe from the scars of political violence popped the bubble of delusion built up in the psyche of democratic regimes after the fall of the United States. Despite hasty defeats for the Communists, the Australian Army failed to dislodge particularly stubborn pockets of resistance located primarily in the outback and Western Australia, forcing Canberra to call in the remnants of NATO (Now known as the 'Democratic League') for help.\n\n Even if a Communist Revolution in Australia wasn't the most likely possibility, an embarrassing lack of planning discarded a golden moment for the CPA, and killed any even remote possibility that the Communists would gain relevance at the national level. Being declared illegal after the uprising's conclusion, the CPA has remained underground ever since. Despite the Civil War being nothing but a memory nowadays, and most Australians declaring "those bloody communists" guilty dead for causing the collapse of the Federal government, there are still murmurs, whispers that the CPA still prevails in the shadows. In small bush towns, battle-hardened veterans of this conflict plot their revenge, armed with invaluable experience gained in the '87 war, and determined beyond measure to finally finish the fight against Capitalism. Combined with the newfound efforts of Red China and Indonesia to meddle in Australian politics, the Civil War remains an ever-present sign that Australia can never truly be safe from the clutches of Communism."
  AST_Power_Projection:0 "The Modern Defense Force"
  AST_Power_Projection_desc:0 "The aftermath of the '87 war saw the transformation of Australia's Armed Forces from a second-rate army mostly concerned with disaster relief, to a truly modern military force which can effectively project its power across the South Pacific and beyond. This focus on the military, while strengthening Australia's status on the world stage, has also led to a certain level of unspoken influence by the Military in political affairs taking hold. Australian citizens remain keenly aware of the dangers posed by Communist regimes both across the world and on Australia's doorstep, and have granted their leaders, elected and not, sweeping powers to deal with them as they see fit. This attitude has manifested in an increasingly war-hungry population that has been entranced by 'unconventional' solutions to deal with the nation's ever-present 'Communism Problem'. Despite this, the lessons of the CPA's defeat have allowed Australia's democracy to survive and flourish through the 21'st century unlike in New Zealand and countless other formerly democratic regimes across the world."
  AST_China_Issue:0 "The Issue of China"
  AST_China_Issue_desc:0 "Australia's relationship with the People's Republic of China is a complicated one, to say the least. While in close proximity to the PRC, Australia had been mostly successful in avoiding Chinese influence thanks both to the influence of the United States and China's self-imposed isolation. This status quo has held firm even throughout the collapse of the US, where Australia looked increasingly to their Commonwealth brethren in Canada for leadership. However Australia's delicate relationship with China has begun deteriorating in recent years, as the pro-market reforms of [CHI.GetLeader] put China on the world stage once more. The prolific influence of China and Indonesia in Australian domestic affairs led to the collapse of the National-Liberal coalition, and has been a fervent talking point who view China's erosion of Australia's sovereignty as our nation's greatest threat. While partnership with China would undoubtedly be lucrative, our less than friendly relationship with Beijing and the Communist world has many supporting a closer draw to Canada as a strategic wedge against Chinese influence."
  AST_South_Pacific_Powerhouse:0 "South Pacific Powerhouse"
  AST_South_Pacific_Powerhouse_desc:0 "Following the collapse of the United States, Australia has become the main guardian and custodian of the Pacific. Working together with Canada, and Hawaii, the Royal Australian Navy works tirelessly to keep the world's largest ocean safe. Indeed, Australia's influence over the various small island nations which line the Pacific can not be understated. While many of these governments are less than friendly to the Democratic League and their ideals, our possession of Oceania's largest navy has ensured that even the most hostile regimes in the region tread cautiously in regards to Aussie affairs."
  AST_Land_of_Extremes:0 "Land of Extremes"
  AST_Land_of_Extremes_desc:0 "Australia's biosphere is unlike any else in the world, possessing both lush grasslands, fertile tropics, and vast arid deserts. While beautiful, Australia's physical climate is also very dangerous, and known for extreme unpredictability. Many of the more populated areas of our nation are stuck varying between drought conditions and torrential downpours, making daily life for many Australians outside the major cities a constant guessing game. The majority of Australia's vast terrain is less than friendly towards human settlement, with even less of our land being suitable for agriculture. 99% of Australia's population has gravitated towards the coast, and the vast 'Outback' in Australia's heartland is virtually devoid of life; with most of the population being concentrated in small towns and settlements dotting the region. "
  AST_govgen_quentin_bryce:0 "Governor-General: Quentin Bryce"
  AST_govgen_quentin_bryce_desc:0 "The Governor-General of Australia is the representative of the British Monarch in Australia. While mostly a figurehead role, the Governor-General has the important duty of granting Royal Assent to any bills passed in the House of Representatives. The current Governor-General is Quentin Bryce; the 25th Governor-General of Australia and the first woman to hold the position. While controversial to some due to accusations of 'Politicizing the Office', Bryce remains a popular and respected figure in Australia. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n £GFX_Portrait_AST_Quentin_Bryce\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
