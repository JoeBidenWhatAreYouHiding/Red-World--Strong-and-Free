 golden_gate_usa.1.t:0 "Fate of the American Dream under President Harris?"
 golden_gate_usa.1.d:0 "With our recent conquest of the states of Arizona and Great Lakes, some within the Golden Gate League have proposed throwing our hat in the ring of the other claimants to the legacy of the former United States. The former UAPR, like the governments in Atlanta and Philadelphia, both maintained their claims to the entirety of the United States' territory, claims which were abandoned after the fall of Communism. With control over the bulk of the Southwest and Pacific territories, we would stand as a formidable force in the race to re-unify the United States if we do opt to shed our Separatist claims. Despite this, there are many who wish to maintain some sense of neutrality, and orient our vast military machine away from the territories of the once United States. "
 golden_gate_usa.1.o1:0 "The United States is dead, and that way it shall remain."
 golden_gate_usa.1.o2:0 "The Golden Gate League shall revive the American Dream!"
 
 golden_gate_usa.2.t:0 "Ultimatum From Harris"
 golden_gate_usa.2.d:0 "President Harris of the Pacific States has personally sent a diplomatic envoy to Milwaukee today, to deliver a shocking ultimatum. According to the document, Great Lakes will be unified with our Western neighbors with immediate effect. Refusing the ultimatum however could apparently result in a declaration of war, leading to disaster for countless innocents. [Root.GetLeader]'s cabinet is naturally bitterly divided on this issue, as one side is prepared to face Pacific troops if it means securing the Great Lakes's independence. The other side supports unification as long as innocent lives are spared."
 golden_gate_usa.2.o1:0 "Accept"
 golden_gate_usa.2.o2:0 "Refuse"
 
 golden_gate_usa.3.t:0 "Great Lakes Accepts Ultimatum"
 golden_gate_usa.3.d:0 "Thankfully the government of [GRL.GetLeader] has accepted our simple ultimatum. Their Foreign Minister made a secret call to his counterpart in Los Angeles regarding listed demands, stating that the Great Lakes government has no other option. Hence control over the Republic will be handed over to the Pacific States with immediate effect, and Great Lakes authorities will be absorbed into our own bureaucracy. This is a glorious day for the American people and a lesson for every neighboring country. As long as they play by our rules there will be peace in our time."
 golden_gate_usa.3.o1:0 "Unity!"
 
 golden_gate_usa.4.t:0 "Great Lakes Rejects Ultimatum"
 golden_gate_usa.4.d:0 "The Milwaukee government has rejected our ultimatum with great fanfare. Instead of welcoming unification with open arms, as any normal administration would have done in this situation, [GRL.GetLeader] announced on national television that the 'putrid fascists' had demanded 'annexation' by occupying forces. Now the Pacific States stand at a crossroads. Should we stand by our demands and immediately declare war upon the stubborn republic, or lay back and let our pride go?"
 golden_gate_usa.4.o1:0 "Traitors!"

 golden_gate_usa.5.d:0 "In a grand parade today, the President of the United States has formally been sworn in on the U.S. Capitol Grounds for the first time since Ronald Reagan. The President, surrounded by her husband Doug Emhoff and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, formally took the oath of office, becoming the first person to hold the title of President of the United States since 1987. The words 'I, Kamala Devi Harris, that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God.' rang through the hallowed Capitol grounds, all Americans regardless of creed or belief knew that their nation was finally whole again. "

 golden_gate_usa.6.t:0 "Constitution Formally Restored"
 golden_gate_usa.6.d:0 "After 20 years of being squabbled over by false despots and autocrats, the Capitol Mall is finally in the hands of the true American Government. With the Capitol restored, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, both of which still have their original copy intact, have been formally restored as the law of the land. With the Constitution in force again, the law of the land in America which existed before the tragic events of 1987 has finally been upheld after decades of upheaval, signaling to all that the United States as it once was has returned. Of course, not all are happy about the Constitution's unaltered restoration, with some calling for major reform to some of the more outdated passages in an attempt to prevent the events of the Reagan administration from repeating. However the President has rebuked these proposals, signifying their faith in the unaltered Constitution which got the United States through the first 200 years of its existence. "
 golden_gate_usa.6.o1:0 "God Bless America!"
 
 golden_gate_usa.7.t:0 "Congressional Elections Held"
 golden_gate_usa.7.d:0 "Congress once stood as one of the most integral pillars of the American Democracy that once was. The false 'Remnant' Governments maintained control of the Capitol, but ultimately did very little with the grounds, leaving them to rot as a testament to how far the United States had fallen. Thankfully, now that the rightful American Government has been restored, Congress has been restored to its ful glory... albeit was 'reduced' responsibility as a result of the current administration's emphasis on Executive power. Of the hundreds of restored seats for the House of Representatives and the Senate, several are predicted to be won by Independent candidates, however both major parties have also made an effort to capture key seats. With all the ballots counted, it is clear that Congress has been won by...  "

 golden_gate_usa.8.d:0 "The United States has so-far reluctantly tolerated our existence, however today, President [USA.GetLeader] has contacted Prime Minister [CSD.GetLeader] about the prospect of unifying our two nations. The Americans have offered very generous terms to us in exchange for unification, including generous amounts of autonomy and a special status for our legislators within Congress. While some would call their terms fair, others do not wish to forfeit our independence in such a manner. At the end of the day, it has been decided that we will..."
 golden_gate_usa.8.o1:0 "Accept their proposal."
 golden_gate_usa.8.o2:0 "Refuse their proposal."
 
 golden_gate_usa.9.t:0 "Cascadia Accepts Proposal"
 golden_gate_usa.9.d:0 "Thankfully the government of [CSD.GetLeader] has accepted our simple demands. Their Foreign Minister made a secret call to their counterpart in Washington regarding listed demands, stating that Cascadia has accepted our proposal for unification. Hence control over the Republic will be handed over to the Pacific States with immediate effect, and Cascadian authorities will be absorbed into our own bureaucracy. This is a glorious day for the American people and a lesson for every neighboring country. As long as they play by our rules there will be peace in our time."
 golden_gate_usa.9.o1:0 "Unity!"
 
 golden_gate_usa.10.t:0 "Cascadia Rejects Proposal"
 golden_gate_usa.10.d:0 "The Cascadian government has rejected our ultimatum with great fanfare. Instead of welcoming unification with open arms, as any normal administration would have done in this situation, [CSD.GetLeader] announced that they are intent on keeping their nation's autonomy. Now the restored United States stands at a crossroads. Should we stand by our demands and immediately declare war upon the stubborn republic, or lay back and let our pride go?"
 golden_gate_usa.10.o1:0 "We shall take what is ours!"
 golden_gate_usa.10.o2:0 "It's time to let Cascadia go..."
 
 golden_gate_usa.11.t:0 "The Americans Approach Us"
 golden_gate_usa.11.d:0 "At long last, the United States has been united under a friendly Democratic administration, one which seems to share our goal of taking down Global Communism and restoring the light of Freedom and Democracy across the world. The Americans, while seemingly intent on joining forces with our movement, also seem to wish to take leadership of the Democratic League once more... something which Canadian leadership is more hesitant to agree to. In a meeting between American President [PCA.GetLeader] and Canadian Prime Minister [CAN.GetLeader], it has ultimately been agreed that the United States shall..."
 golden_gate_usa.11.o1:0 "Be taking leadership of the Democratic League once more."
 golden_gate_usa.11.o2:0 "Become the Democratic League's newest member."
 
 golden_gate_usa.12.t:0 "The Canadians Hand Over Leadership"
 golden_gate_usa.12.d:0 "With the rightful government of the United States restored, it has ultimately been decided that the United States will be restored to their previous position as leader of the Democratic League. In a grand ceremony in Ottawa, President [PCA.GetLeader] met with Canadian Prime Minister [CAN.GetLeader] to formalize the handover]. In a grand speech, [PCA.GetLeader] declared that America was ready to step up and lead again, and were already preparing with their allies to take down the Communist menace once and for all."
 golden_gate_usa.12.o1:0 "A great day for America."
 
 golden_gate_usa.14.t:0 "The Canadians Retain Leadership"
 golden_gate_usa.14.d:0 "Although the rightful government of the United States has been restored, it has ultimately been decided that the Canadians will retain their current position as leader of the Democratic League. While a disappointing conclusion for some, the Canadians seem to have their reasons for keeping hold of DL Leadership. America still has deep scars from the Reunification campaign, and as of now Canada's economic prowess still eclipses our own. While we may once more seek leadership when our economy and military has fully recovered, it seems that for now the Canadians are secure in their position as Democratic League leader."
 golden_gate_usa.14.o1:0 "Oh well..."
 
 golden_gate_usa.15.t:0 "America Requests our Participation in their Alliance"
 golden_gate_usa.15.d:0 "Now that the United States has been restored, senior leadership has reached out to our government formally about the possibility of our nation joining the global struggle against Communism. Thay have requested via their ambassador, our full membership for [ROOT.GetName] within their Alliance, which would make us a key strategic and political ally of our nation. However, there are some in the government that oppose approval of this request... How should we respond?"
 golden_gate_usa.15.o1:0 "Join!"
 golden_gate_usa.15.o2:0 "Refuse"
 
 golden_gate_usa.16.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] Accepts"
 golden_gate_usa.16.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] delegation in our capital brought very exciting news for the government. [FROM.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] will officially be accepting our offer for membership in our alliance, and hence will join the alliance. This is a historic day for not just our nation and its future, but for the people."
 golden_gate_usa.16.o1:0 "Wonderful"

 golden_gate_usa.17.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] Refuses"
 golden_gate_usa.17.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] delegation in our capital brought very unfortunate news for the government. [FROM.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] will not be accepting our offer for membership in our alliance, and hence we will not be joining the alliance. This could have been a historic day for not just our nation and its future, but for the people. Unfortunately, this was not the case..."
 golden_gate_usa.17.o1:0 "Disappointing..."

 golden_gate_usa.18.t:0 "To Defend Freedom"
 golden_gate_usa.18.d:0 "Freedom. The very word can coax great emotion from everyday Americans, and holds wildly different meanings depending on the person who defines it. It is perhaps the word that best summed up America, at least before the Great Collapse. In the new post-reunification America, Freedom, at least the ideal of 'Freedom' in the American context, has taken on new, much different meaning. In Harris' America, to be free is not to follow the wills of squabbling legislators, or self-serving Bureaucrats desperate to make a name for themselves. In our America, true freedom is freedom from bickering legislators, from Communist bureaucrats and Remnant Reactionaries, and freedom to express our nation's undying devotion and loyalty to President Harris, and the soldiers who liberated America from tyrants."
 golden_gate_usa.18.o1:0 "...and under President Harris, you shall have the freedom to be free."

 golden_gate_usa.19.t:0 "The Pacific Dream Spreads"
 golden_gate_usa.19.d:0 "In the age of yore, ordinary folk from across the United States flocked west in an attempt to snag themselves a piece of what would one day become the 'American Dream'. Dreamers, visionaries who built in the West Coast America's ideal society; an idylic land of sandy beaches and sunny shores, a land where Americans can breathe true freedom. Tragically, the revolution of 1989 changed everything, institing a brutal Soviet-backed dictatorship which robbed the Pacific of the freedoms once took for granted. Thankfully, President Harris restored the spirit of the Pacific States, and worked tirelessly to spread the Californian ideals of Freedom to the backwater dictatorships which occupied the Eastern Seaboard. Now standing as the leader of a proud and unified America, Kamala Harris shall ensure that the Pacifican ideals of Freedom shall remain paramount across the entirety of America, and that never more will false tyrants dare to occupy American soil."
 golden_gate_usa.19.o1:0 "This We'll Defend."

 golden_gate_usa.20.t:0 "Elections to be Restored"
 golden_gate_usa.20.d:0 "As the United States Constitution is restored in full force, the decision has been made to hold this cycle's Presidential Elections early. Election dates, as defined originally in the Constitution, are to be held on the first Tuesday of November every four years. However the over 20 years of the United States not existing has thrown a wrench into the traditional schedule. Ultimately, the Federal Election Commission has received permission from the President and Congress to hold early elections, ignoring two centuries of previous precedence to allow voters an opportunity to democratically decide on the leadership of the 'New United States'. While they may not coincide exactly with the dates in which elections were held before the collapse of the United States, President Harris is confident that these early elections will help ease tensions, and allow voters in many parts of the country to elect their leaders for the first time in decades."
 golden_gate_usa.20.o1:0 "Good."

 golden_gate_usa.21.t:0 "United Front Nominates Candidate"
 golden_gate_usa.21.d:0 "The campaign is in full swing after the announcement of early elections, as dozens of candidates challenge incumbent President Kamala Harris for the position of President of the United States. Several fringe nationalist and socialist groups have vowed to participate in the election in an attempt to dislodge the President; however these groups have been swiftly barred by the Federal Election Commission and formally declared illegal. The main group aiming to deny Harris the keys to the White House is the so-called 'Democratic-Republican Unity League', a broad collection of pre-unification local parties. In a large convention held in Louisville, the DRUL has announced that their party has selected a candidate to run in the upcoming elections. Challenging President Harris is Willard Mitt Rommney, who served as the first Governor of the restored State of Michigan, and who would become the first Mormon President of an American nation besides Utah if elected."
 golden_gate_usa.21.o1:0 "Does this 'DRUL' have any chance of winning?"

 golden_gate_usa.22.t:0 "Mitt Rommney Assassinated!"
 golden_gate_usa.22.d:0 "During a campaign stop in Cincinnati, Ohio, tragedy befell DRUL Presidential Nominee Mitt Rommney as a masked gunman began firing wildly at Governor Rommney's podium, striking him and several others dead. In the wake of this tragic shooting, Rommney's running mate, Indiana Senator Dan Quayle, was quickly nominated by an ad-hoc Party Convention after the Governor was officially pronounced dead. President Harris has expressed her deep condolences and has instructed the restored FBI to do everything in their power to find and punish Rommney's killer. Despite Harris' kind words in regard to her political rival's passing, it seems that some still believe that the President was involved in a sinister plot to assassinate her election challenger. Regardless, Rommney's death remains as a grim reminder to the violence which plagues much of our nation, and the fact that the scars from over 20 years of division still have not healed."
 golden_gate_usa.22.o1:0 "Dear God..."

 golden_gate_usa.23.t:0 "Presidential Debates Held"
 golden_gate_usa.23.d:0 "As was tradition before the collapse of the United States, televised debates between the two major candidates are to be held today. Facing off is current President Kamala Harris, and her challenger, Senator Dan Quayle. While both candidates had a strong start as moderator Dan Rather began with the questions, Quayle seemed to crack quickly under the pressure of the spotlight, as his failure to answer several questions being looked poorly to countless viewers. However what seemed to close the lid on his coffin was his comparison to the slain Senator John F. Kennedy, which elicits the response 'I've heard Jack Kennedy speak, and you Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy' from a moderator. The youthful and energetic Harris quickly took the lead as Quayle struggled, especially around questions regarding Quayle's age and phlebitis. At the program's conclusion, 61% of viewers had concluded that President Harris had won the debate."
 golden_gate_usa.23.o1:0 "Few can doubt Harris' ability."

 golden_gate_usa.24.t:0 "Presidential Debates Held"
 golden_gate_usa.24.d:0 "tradition before the collapse of the United States, televised debates between the two major candidates are to be held today. Facing off is current President Kamala Harris, and her challenger, Governor Mitt Rommney. At the offset of the debate, both candidates began with a strong start as moderator Dan Rather began with the questions. Both Harris and Rommney held their own under the spotlight and answered the tough questions to the best of their ability. At the program's conclusion, a poll of viewers on who won the debate came up evenly split. While both Rommney and Harris had a strong performance, ultimately it seems that this debate has failed to move the needle for any candidate. Both Harris and Rommney claimed victory in the debate, and have stated that they remain hopeful for their prospects in the upcoming election. However at the end of the day, it is up to the American voter to decide who will lead their nation for the next four years."
 golden_gate_usa.24.o1:0 "Interesting."

 golden_gate_usa.25.t:0 "Presidential Elections of [GetYear]"
 golden_gate_usa.25.d:0 "For the first time since 1984, citizens of a United America will head to the polls to cast their ballot for President of the United States. Of the countless candidates aiming to seize this historic office for the first time in decades, two prominent contenders have emerged: incumbent President Kamala Harris, the woman who united America and led the armies of the Golden Gate League to victory, and who is backed by a seemingly unstoppable media and political machine... and Mitt Rommney, who was recently elected the first post-Unification Governor of Michigan. While polls show Harris ahead by a large margin, a fierce campaign by Governor Rommney still has Harris on the defensive. Romney, who has delivered a strong message of change, is attempting to lock Harris out of the White House and seize his own page in the history books, campaigning to the bitter end in an attempt to do so. After all the ballots have been counted, major news networks have projected that the next President of the United States shall be... "
 golden_gate_usa.25.o1:0 "Kamala Harris - All for America!"

 golden_gate_usa.26.t:0 "Presidential Elections of [GetYear]"
 golden_gate_usa.26.d:0 "For the first time since 1984, citizens of a United America will head to the polls to cast their ballot for President of the United States. Of the countless candidates aiming to seize this historic office for the first time in decades, two prominent contenders have emerged: incumbent President Kamala Harris, the woman who united America and led the armies of the Golden Gate League to victory, and who is backed by a seemingly unstoppable media and political machine... and Dan Quayle, a former Senator from Indiana before the collapse of the United States. Despite Quayle being the only prominent contender to Harris to emerge during this election cycle, polls still predicted Harris would secure a landslide victory in the Electoral College and comfortable margins in the popular vote. However it seems that Harris's margins of victory were even larger than predicted. At the end of the day, President Harris has won every single state in the Union, and nearly every state with a comfortable margin. Only Indiana, the home state of Dan Quayle, has been decided by close margins for Harris. Harris was called as President by every major network before the night was over, and Quayle delivered a humiliating concession speech shortly after."
 golden_gate_usa.26.o1:0 "Four More Years! Four More Years!"

 golden_gate_usa.27.t:0 "Term Limits Abolished"
 golden_gate_usa.27.d:0 "The issue of term limits has always been a hot-button issue for American politicians. Before the 22nd amendment was codified, Presidents were limited to two terms by tradition, in a precedent first set by George Washington himself. After Franklin D. Roosevelt's historic four-term tenure, Congress ultimately moved to limit the amount of time a President can serve in office. While Harris has already served as President of the Pacific States for some time, these were ruled to not count as contributing to her term as POTUS, allowing her to run for re-elected. However Harris has expressed interest in running for a third term, and has pressured Congress to take action in repealing the 22nd amendment. Today, Congress officially repealed the amendment, allowing President Harris to run for a third term. Already Harris has filed paperwork to run for re-election, and with a lack of serious opposition, it seems that Harris has already secured another term."
 golden_gate_usa.27.o1:0 "Interesting."

 golden_gate_usa.28.t:0 "DRUL Campaign Collapses"
 golden_gate_usa.28.d:0 "After the tragic death of Mitt Rommney and the utter failure of Dan Quayle to pose a challenge to President Harris, it seems that the Democratic-Republican Unity League has faded into relative obscurity. Several minor politicians expressed interest in a run under the DRUL banner, however after a disastrous convention attended by only a few dozen attendees, in the end, nobody was nominated within the deadline. Many of the most prominent opposition figures to President Harris have either declined to run, or have withdrawn their candidacy under pressure from mysterious forces. As it seems, the ramshackle remains of the DRUL seem to have been simply forgotten, with every major pollster predicting Harris carrying every single state in the United States by a wide margin. Some of the candidates who expressed interest in the Presidency have however decided on independent runs of their own... runs which are still unlikely to clear even five percent of the vote each. "

 golden_gate_usa.29.d:0 "Once more, American citizens will head to the polls to cast their ballot for President of the United States. Ultimately, no organized opposition to Harris has emerged, leading most to predict that the incumbent President will be re-elected comfortably. The failure of the DRUL to nominate a candidate has led to Harris carrying triple digit margins in every single state. Before the end of the night, President Harris declared victory and gave a rousing victory speech, while the few opposition candidates shuffled away from the spotlight, defeated, knowing that the nation was not even interested in hearing their concession speeches. While Kamala Harris has been criticized for manipulating elections and directly controlling media outlets in order to establish a cult of personality, in the end it seems that their criticisms haven't made an impact. Hopefully their conspiracy theories will end in the years to come as Americans finally realise the unlimited potential of four more years under a Low presidency. In the short term however, the President's camp is naturally celebrating another big win for freedom, democracy and strength abroad, as candidates who threatened to destroy our prosperous way of life are crushed at the polls.

With 28% of the votes counted and 71% of those going to President Rommney, the night is still young and yet there is little doubt as to who will be elected President of the United States. Despite the whirlwind campaign across the nation from former President Harris, the woman who took credit for re-unifying the United States was ultimately unable to challenge the incumbent President. Owing in part to her defeat was the extensive amount of authority the incumbent President utilized during his campaign; executive action which was authorized by Harris herself during her presidency. Despite the strength of Rommney's campaign, international observers have criticized it for supposedly being 'only relatively free and fair' compared to the socialist administration, but 'deeply troubling' compared to other democratic societies. While Harris, during her campaign to retake the White House has declared that Rommney utilized his vast media and political machine to manipulate election, Rommney's strategies ultimately don't differ from the strategies used by the Golden Gate League in previous elections."

Despite being mocked for several high-profile gaffes, Quayle's status as an effective Vice-President has made him a lock for this year's party convention, and with the DRUL's unstoppable popularity, it seemed to be only a matter of time before Quayle became President. While Martin O'Malley's All-for-America Party put up a respectable campaign, distancing themselves from former President Kamala Harris, it seems that the DRUL is no longer in a position to be challenged for control of the Presidency."

So effective was this campaign that international observers have criticized it for supposedly being 'only relatively free and fair' compared to the socialist administration, but 'deeply troubling' compared to other democratic societies. These accusations reportedly angered the President so much that she called for an investigation this month into media and political organizations that seek to 'undermine the democratic integrity of our great nation'. Assuming that Harris comes out on top by the end of tonight, this investigation will become a reality and the President's strength shall certainly never lie in question again."

 golden_gate_usa.34.d:0 "As outlined in the constitution of the Pacific States, a President cannot serve for over two full consecutive terms, meaning Kamala Harris is ineligible to run in the upcoming election. It is for this reason that the President made an unsurprising announcement this morning in her last televised address, that she would not be seeking re-election, and would soon endorse a new candidate for the All-for-America Party to run in the next election. Despite ending her address on a relatively somber note, she stated her firm belief and trust in the next President, whoever that person may be. Two main candidates have been proposed, Harris' husband, Doug Emhoff, and Martin O'Malley, a relatively obscure Cabinet Minister. Emhoff during his tenure as First Gentleman has established himself as a beloved public figure, and would likely be an uncontroversial pick if his Candidacy wouldn't raise countless accusations of nepotism. O'Malley on the other hand is an experienced administrator and civil servant, however his relative lack of notoriety might serve to weaken his position. At the end of the day, it is clear to both Harris' supporters and detractors that whoever is picked will simply be a political vessel through which Harris exerts a level of hidden control over the nation."

At the end of the day, most Americans don't seem to mind Emhoff's status as a puppet of the former President. Much of Harris' popularity has transferred to her husband, as the people of America welcome four more years of rule by Kamala Harris... albeit in a much less direct way. "

 golden_gate_usa.37.d:0 "As the polls close, it has become clear that President Harris has been elected to yet another term as President of the United States. While polls showed that no other party had so much as a shot at the Presidency, the margins in which Harris won by are a shock even to some in the GGL. Early results from this year's presidential election are showing a record low turnout, despite calls from the opposition to 'fight back against corruption', a campaign that has utterly failed to mount any formidable resistance against the Golden Gate League's brutal political machine. With low turnout, the polls are showing an easy win for the President and her incoming administration, perhaps with an even greater margin than her first victory those many years ago. Coming out victorious tonight would undeniably cement the Golden Gate League as America's permanent ruling party, bar a total political upset once Harris and other well-known leaders are entirely out of the picture. The opposition though believe such a scenario would have to be decades from now, and are hoping with all their resolve that somehow the final stretch of vote counting proves to deal a massive blow against Kamala Harris. Americans know that simply won't happen."

With the founding principles of America upheld and democracy, or at very least the form of 'Democracy' practiced by the Golden Gate League, enshrined across the continent once more, the future of America seems hopeful. However, the American economy lies in ruins due to the reunification wars and the President’s first task will be to save the struggling American economic system, or else risk another collapse. Despite this, the Democratic League has begun preparations for America’s entry into their alliance. While this is a victory for democracy, the Warsaw Pact has shown its displeasure with the reinstatement of the old capitalist system in America. Having begrudgingly sent ambassadors to America, it is clear that the tensions of the Cold War have been reignited once more."

With Harris not previously serving as POTUS, she is not constrained by the same term limits as in the United States. Harris, long considered the true power behind President Low, has instructed him to step aside, allowing Harris to rise as the first President of the United States since Ronald Reagan. While some have protested this move and declared it illegal, the fact that the former Pacific Constitution has been discarded means that there are few legal means available to challenge Harris' claim to the Presidency."
