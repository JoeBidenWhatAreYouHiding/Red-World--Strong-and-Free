 texas.1.t:0 "Senate Building Attack"
 texas.1.d:0 "As the smoke cleared from last week's riots, it seemed that Texas may finally be experiencing a sense of calm. Congress was assembled to discuss the damage from the Austin Riots, and debate their strategy going forward. Before representatives could assemble in the chamber, a tremendous explosion ripped through the building, killing dozens of government figures, spectators, and building staff. Four bombs were hidden in the chamber while security staff was busy dispatching rioters during the Austin insurgency, three in the Senate chamber and one in the main hall. Estimates for the casualties are in the hundreds as emergency services rush to aid those who survived. Among the slain were more than 20 representatives, and five Senators, mainly from the One Republic Party, who were assembled on the side of the Senate Chamber where the bomb was planted, as well as sitting President and former Vice-President, David Dewherst. Thankfully, President Perry was sheilded from the worst of the blast, only sustaining minor injuries. As the dust settles, one question remains... could the pro-Remnant forces we've been hearing from for the past few months be the perpetrators of this grotesque attack? Or have anti-Perry elements taken extreme action to depose the sitting President?"

 texas.2.t:0 "Texas Senate Attacked!"
 texas.2.d:0 "The CIA Director has made President [USA.GetLeader] aware of an attack on the Texan Senate. The good news is that, the three explosive devices smuggled into the Texan Senate Chamber all detonated sucsesfully. Unfortunatley, it seems that key targets including President Perry managed to survive the explosion. Luckily, preliminary reports still suggest that the recent attack on the Senate has caused a signifigant amount of agitation within the Republic of Texas, possibly leading to a repeat of last week's riots. The death of several key officials has given us a period where Texan Government and Military forces are struggling to recover from the Senate attack, and have failed to deal with recent spike in civil unrest. Military figures have suggested we use this window of oppurtunity, framing our intervention in Texas as a peacekepping mission to restore order in the rogue Texan Republic. The Military Brass has been alerted, and our soldiers are already on the move to the Texan border."
 texas.2.o1:0 "Very Good, Dismissed."
 
 usa.4.t:0 "The Texan Question"
 usa.4.d:0 "With the recent attack on the Texan Senate, claimed by a radical pro-Republic group, the time has come for us as a nation to answer the Texan question that for many years has encroached on America-Texas relations. Should our Western neighbour become an integrated state or satellite state of the Republic, and will they accept?"
 usa.4.o1:0 "A Texan state"

 usa.5.t:0 "American Republic's Demands"
 usa.5.d:0 "With the recent attack on the Texan Senate, claimed by a radical pro-Republic group, the American cabinet met to discuss the supposed 'Texan Question' concerning our place in relation to the Republic. Today their Ambassador in Dallas delivered a note to the President, proposing total unification of our two nations. This would erase Texan independence and turn us into a state of the American Republic."

 usa.6.t:0 "American Republic's Demands"
 usa.6.d:0 "With the recent attack on the Texan Senate, claimed by a radical pro-Republic group, the American cabinet met to discuss the supposed 'Texan Question' concerning our place in relation to the Republic. Today their Ambassador in Dallas delivered a note to the President, proposing our government become a close satellite administration.

 usa.6.o2:0 "Never!"
 
 usa.7.t:0 "Texas Refuses"
 usa.7.d:0 "The Texan ambassador met with the President today, outlining his government's response to our extremely generous offer.

 usa.15.t:0 "Texan Separatists Revolt"
 usa.15.d:0 "Apparently the debates in Congress and subsequent rulings have not appeased Texans enough, and thousands of separatists have risen up against the new state government. Dallas has been declared by many as 'traitors' to Texas and now it seems we have an insurrection on our hands."
 usa.15.o1:0 "We can't do anything right for them"
