 usa.181.t:0 "King Lucian I Calls Snap Election"
 usa.181.d:0 "Within the past few years, the American monarchy has radically changed, morphing from hereditary despotism under Mark Milley and Paul I to a true democratic system under an elected monarch of House Jefferson of Monticello. Following this reformation of our monarchy into an elective, federalist system, Lucian I Jefferson has called for new snap elections, with [Root.GetLeader] expected to run again.\n\nChallenging our current PM, however, lies many uniquely Jeffersonian candidates who claim to echo the values of our monarch, the most notable being the libertarian media personality and businessman Joe Exotic (Better known as the 'Tiger King'), echoing Jefferson's love for small government, and agrarian conservative Sonny Perdue. An economic liberal seeking to restore small government values, Carlson would like to see both the King and Congress leave social and economic freedoms to the people, while Sonny Perdue, a former agricultural baron and Republican has embraced a Jeffersonian populist ideal of the working farmer.\n\nThe People's Party and National Renewal Party, of course, have continued to remain involved in politics, but neither of their candidates have appeared uniquely Jeffersonian in an era of monarchy."

 usa.182.t:0 "King Douglas I Calls Snap Election"
 usa.182.d:0 "Within the past few years, the American monarchy has radically changed, morphing from hereditary despotism under Mark Milley and Paul I to a true democratic system under an elected monarch of House Hamilton, architects of a new America. Following this reformation of our monarchy into an elective, federalist system, Douglas I Hamilton has called for new snap elections, with [Root.GetLeader] expected to run again.\n\nChallenging our current PM, however, lies a candidate many expect would despise everything Hamilton stood for, small government libertarian and prominent media personality Joe Exotic, and representing the Independence Union's Hamiltonian wing, fiscal and social moderate Joe Manchin. An economic liberal seeking to restore small government values, Carlson would like to see both the King and Congress leave social and economic freedoms to the people, while Joseph Manchin, emblematic of a populist and moderate conservative appeal, echoes the hard-working, immigrant values of House Hamilton.\n\nThe People's Party and National Renewal Party, of course, have continued to remain involved in politics, but neither of their candidates have appeared uniquely Hamiltonian in an era of monarchy."

 usa.187.t:0 "Federalist Party Formed"
 usa.187.d:0 "To fill the void of the Republican Party, a new centrist party has risen, currently led by none other than the famed orator and politician turned staunch voice for monarchy, Barry Obama. Obama and his allies have formed the "Federalist Party", a group that pledges to uphold the monarchy as a new, core symbol of American life and reunify America under the banner of Paul I's United Kingdoms of America. A constitutionalist party, the Federalists advocate for further democratization within the monarchist system as a general principle, along with economic centrism and generally, social progressivism, if not extreme patriotism and nationalism for the American system. As the party expands, observers expect it to be divided between Obama's centrist monarchist wing, libertarians, such as the influential businessman and 'Tiger King' Joe Exotic, and former Democrats, like rising star John Bel Edwards."

 britain.1001.t:0 "LANCE Project Revealed"
 britain.1001.d:0 "As the dust surrounding the tragic death of Prince Harry and Prime Minister Owen clears, the question of the assasin's motives and abilities have permeated the atmosphere of British Society. While details at first have been kept hush-hush, it has finally been revealed that the assassin was a former covert agent for MI6 who took part in illegal human experimentation. According to the leaked documents, the assassin was the subject of a covert brainwashing program meant to create ideal agents who could follow orders without conscience. This project, while flagrantly illegal, was authorized directly by the Prime Minister and kept secret from the Queen. When the project failed, instead of owning up to their mistakes the Government simply destroyed the evidence; allowing agents to fall into Soviet hands and ultimately condemning Owen and Prince Harry to die. In the wake of these revelations, the Queen has remained deathly silent, consumed both by the death of her son, and the fact that the British Government has been engaged in such barbaric acts without either her knowledge or consent. "
 britain.1001.o1:0 "Ghastly...."
 britain.1002.t:0 "The Queen's Apology"
 britain.1002.d:0 "Today, Queen Elizabeth II has officially apologized for the incident at Parliament after the death of Prime Minister Owen. The Queen has stated that her actions were improper, and that in her grief-stricken state she was not in the right state of mind. This announcement by Her Majesty has cooled over much of the remaining tension with the Monarchy, even if most of the country has already moved on. While Republican groups still haven't forgiven Elizabeth for her actions, the ability for the Queen to be humble and accept wrongdoing has done much for the Monarchy's image. Additionally, the Queen telling her side of the story has revealed much of the Queen's thought-process on the matter, and has legitimized her actions in the minds of many. Of course, there are still those who believe that Britain would be languishing under a Royal Dictatorship if we hadn't stopped the Queen on that fateful day."
 
 cuba.259.t:0 "Army of the Lord Takes Over the Cuban Government"
 cuba.259.d:0 "In an expected yet still shocking turn of events, El Cabro, commander in chief of the Army of the Lord, was appointed President of Cuba with the unanimous assent of the Cuban Liberty Council today. Known by the civil name of Rafael Edward Cruz, El Cabro immediately went on to give his biggest sermon so far in front of a celebrating crowd of supporters, clearly overjoyed that an era of a ‘proper Christian government’ has been inaugurated in Cuba. Such ecstatic enjoyment, however, is not quite shared by the overwhelming majority of the population - although most are glad to see the ‘fascist exiles’ gone, they are equally as disconcerted about what this new regime will bring, as its fundamentalist rhetoric and terrorist past invoke fears that Rafael Cruz is going to turn out even more oppressive than the much reviled Pepe Hernandez and his cronies. In the meanwhile, the new leader himself seems to be vague and distant about what his government will even bring to Cuba, simply pledging to the people that they shall never again be deprived of their ‘freedom to worship the Lord’. As guerillas and militants shuffle into El Capitolio, turning from warriors to politicians, the new regime readies itself to renew everything according to Cruz’s personal wishes, while the Cubans are simply left to await what comes next. Canadians are notably surprised that the long-missing father of the infamous Canadian Alliance Party leader was really 'El Cabro' all along."

Canadians have reacted with unbound shock disgraced Member of Parliament and leader of the minor right-wing Canadian Alliance Party, who disappeared to beat a murder investigation, was the infamous Cuban terrorist 'El Cabro' all along - or at least *a* 'El Cabro', as many believe that the aging Cruz Sr. transferred leadership of the Army of the Lord to his newly-returned son, who shares his father's radical views and disdain for Atheistic Communism, shortly after his arrival in Cuba."

 cuba.124.t:0 "Stronghold of El Cabro Raided Successfully"
cuba.124.d:0 "Following a string of successful raids against the remnants of the Army of the Lord, the intelligence gathered by the DGI has now pointed us toward our ultimate goal, the final stronghold of El Cabro. Enlisting the aid of Military Unit 4895, the strike force was quickly assembled, with our forces being deployed to the pine forests on the outskirts of Pinar del Río. Having arrived at the small compound where it was estimated that no more than seven could be inside, Military Unit 4895 approached slowly, throwing a single flashbang into the main room where a small group of five had gathered. Bewildered, all five were suddenly apprehended with one in particular catching the eyes of all. Dressed in a full military outfit, [GetCruzDescription] was among those captured, refusing  to speak with his captors, merely eyeing them up as he realized that his chances of escape were certainly nil. With their supposed ‘glorious commander’ now on his way to Havana to be processed, it is hoped we shall at long last learn who it was that attacked the Cuban nation, President Raúl Castro has announced the capture of the American puppet to the nation, with the populace taking to the streets to celebrate. At long last, we shall know peace."
