 ### Events ###
 
 usa.98.t:0 "Damaging Information Released"
 usa.98.d:0 "Since President George Bush Senior established a loyalist government in Atlanta, a cult of personality has circled around him and his family. Both brothers have been involved in high-profile, albeit unsuccessful bids for the Presidency, with George Jr. moving to Texas to manage his father's baseball team following his loss. However, it seems this cult of personality could come to a dramatic end with the release of highly damaging information. According to documents released by the Central Intelligence Agency, Vice President Bush, not Reagan, was the one who proposed dissolving the United States. Indeed, it was Bush, not Reagan, who caused the collapse of the United States. Reagan had proposed declaring Martial Law and implementing the Rex 84 plan, while Bush viewed a return to State authority as the best way to prevent further bloodshed. Only after Reagan declared the US's dissolution did Bush break from this position and attempt to rally loyal Governors in support of the Federal Government once he de-facto assumed the Presidency. While more in-depth details about these events are yet to be released, this comes as a shocking blow to the Republican party and Bush loyalists."

 usa.195.t:0 "Republican National Convention Deadlocked"
 usa.195.d:0 "Milley's warning seems to have been more accurate than even the most vocal naysayers in our administration could have predicted. That cocksucker Jeb Bush has managed to deadlock the convention. An insurgent ticket of Jeb Bush and Lindsay Graham have completely deadlocked the convention after numerous rounds of voting. State delegations are now threatening to walk out if their preferred candidate is not supported by prominent politicians who have yet to cast their ballots, and anarchy for the Party seems to be on the horizon. Prominent sources indicate that Jeb Bush may be about to start his own Independent Republican Campaign, with several state RNC delegations rumoured to be supporting Bush in the General Election instead of incumbent President Rumsfeld. We're right in the thick of it, and if we want to make it out of this mess in one piece, we're gonna have to get crafty. Ridge is toast, strong leadership is needed in this time of great uncertainty. Cheney, an old friend and protégé of President Rumsfeld is rumoured to be the President's first pick to replace Ridge, although rumours that 'Master of the Senate' Mitch McConnell has been tapped due to his deep ties to the Republican Political Machine.
