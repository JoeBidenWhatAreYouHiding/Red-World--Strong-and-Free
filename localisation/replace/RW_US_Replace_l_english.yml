 news.286.t:0 "Newt Gingrich Unites America"
 news.286.d:0 "As President Gingrich stood in Washington DC, waiting to be inaugurated as the first President of the United States since the Great Collapse, millions tuned in to watch the event from home and hundreds of thousands turned up to watch in person. As President Gingrich confirmed the unification of America, the nation let out a sudden and glorious cheer in celebration of the event. As Gingrich’s speech continued, he reinforced the values he was elected on by the Protestant clique that had overthrown the radical Mike Pence years prior: Family, God and the State. With Canada remaining neutral on this reunified America and the Warsaw Pact denouncing the state as a return of the old Reagan regime, it has become clear that America will remain isolated from all major powers, and perhaps seek to create its own alliance to rival that of the Democratic League and Warsaw Pact. With Christianity becoming a prominent talking point in daily American life, many have denounced Gingrich’s government for abandoning the principles of the first amendment. However, Gingrich has insisted that America has and will always remain a secular state."

 ### Events ###
 
 usa.98.t:0 "Damaging Information Released"
 usa.98.d:0 "Since President George Bush Senior established a loyalist government in Atlanta, a cult of personality has circled around him and his family. Both brothers have been involved in high-profile, albeit unsuccessful bids for the Presidency, with George Jr. moving to Texas to manage his father's baseball team following his loss. However, it seems this cult of personality could come to a dramatic end with the release of highly damaging information. According to documents released by the Central Intelligence Agency, Vice President Bush, not Reagan, was the one who proposed dissolving the United States. Indeed, it was Bush, not Reagan, who caused the collapse of the United States. Reagan had proposed declaring Martial Law and implementing the Rex 84 plan, while Bush viewed a return to State authority as the best way to prevent further bloodshed. Only after Reagan declared the US's dissolution did Bush break from this position and attempt to rally loyal Governors in support of the Federal Government once he de-facto assumed the Presidency. While more in-depth details about these events are yet to be released, this comes as a shocking blow to the Republican party and Bush loyalists."

 usa.195.t:0 "Republican National Convention Deadlocked"
 usa.195.d:0 "Milley's warning seems to have been more accurate than even the most vocal naysayers in our administration could have predicted. That cocksucker Jeb Bush has managed to deadlock the convention. An insurgent ticket of Jeb Bush and Lindsay Graham have completely deadlocked the convention after numerous rounds of voting. State delegations are now threatening to walk out if their preferred candidate is not supported by prominent politicians who have yet to cast their ballots, and anarchy for the Party seems to be on the horizon. Prominent sources indicate that Jeb Bush may be about to start his own Independent Republican Campaign, with several state RNC delegations rumoured to be supporting Bush in the General Election instead of incumbent President Rumsfeld. We're right in the thick of it, and if we want to make it out of this mess in one piece, we're gonna have to get crafty. Ridge is toast, strong leadership is needed in this time of great uncertainty. Cheney, an old friend and protégé of President Rumsfeld is rumoured to be the President's first pick to replace Ridge, although rumours that 'Master of the Senate' Mitch McConnell has been tapped due to his deep ties to the Republican Political Machine.

 usa.181.t:0 "King Lucian I Calls Snap Election"
 usa.181.d:0 "Within the past few years, the American monarchy has radically changed, morphing from hereditary despotism under Mark Milley and Paul I to a true democratic system under an elected monarch of House Jefferson of Monticello. Following this reformation of our monarchy into an elective, federalist system, Lucian I Jefferson has called for new snap elections, with [Root.GetLeader] expected to run again.\n\nChallenging our current PM, however, lies many uniquely Jeffersonian candidates who claim to echo the values of our monarch, the most notable being the libertarian media personality and businessman Joe Exotic (Better known as the 'Tiger King'), echoing Jefferson's love for small government, and agrarian conservative Sonny Perdue. An economic liberal seeking to restore small government values, Exotic would like to see both the King and Congress leave social and economic freedoms to the people, while Sonny Perdue, a former agricultural baron and Republican has embraced a Jeffersonian populist ideal of the working farmer.\n\nThe People's Party and National Renewal Party, of course, have continued to remain involved in politics, but neither of their candidates have appeared uniquely Jeffersonian in an era of monarchy."

Following this reformation of our monarchy into an elective, federalist system, Douglas I Hamilton has called for new snap elections, with [Root.GetLeader] expected to run again.\n\nChallenging our current PM, however, lies a candidate many expect would despise everything Hamilton stood for, small government libertarian and prominent media personality Joe Exotic, and representing the Independence Union's Hamiltonian wing, fiscal and social moderate Joe Manchin. An economic liberal seeking to restore small government values, Exotic would like to see both the King and Congress leave social and economic freedoms to the people, while Joseph Manchin, emblematic of a populist and moderate conservative appeal, echoes the hard-working, immigrant values of House Hamilton.\n\nThe People's Party and National Renewal Party, of course, have continued to remain involved in politics, but neither of their candidates have appeared uniquely Hamiltonian in an era of monarchy."

 usa.187.t:0 "Federalist Party Formed"
 usa.187.d:0 "To fill the void of the Republican Party, a new centrist party has risen, currently led by none other than the famed orator and politician turned staunch voice for monarchy, Barry Obama. Obama and his allies have formed the "Federalist Party", a group that pledges to uphold the monarchy as a new, core symbol of American life and reunify America under the banner of Paul I's United Kingdoms of America. A constitutionalist party, the Federalists advocate for further democratization within the monarchist system as a general principle, along with economic centrism and generally, social progressivism, if not extreme patriotism and nationalism for the American system. As the party expands, observers expect it to be divided between Obama's centrist monarchist wing, libertarians, such as the influential businessman and 'Tiger King' Joe Exotic, and former Democrats, like rising star John Bel Edwards."

 commonwealth.83.t:0 "[GetChomskyOrNot] Implements Direct Democracy"
 commonwealth.83.d:0 "With the old Central Committee removed from its position of power and an anarcho-syndicalist federation of delegates in power, [GetPresChomskyOrNot] has essentially been reduced to a figurehead. [GetChomskySuccsessorHisOrHerUpperCase] position as our commander in chief is one only existing to showcase unity and a face to turn to in the toughest of times. Nevertheless, the President still at this time has enormous power within the Central Committee, and is using this for the greater good. Today [ROOT.GetLeader] announced that [GetChomskySuccsessorHisOrHer] government would immediately be implementing direct democracy throughout the Federation, demolishing any authoritarian aspects of the old Commonwealth and giving all Americans a say in the political process. This is truly the dawn of a new era for the American people, as old democracy in the United States was simply a feeble attempt at disguising corporatist fascism as 'freedom'."
 commonwealth.83.o1:0 "Democracy lives on!"
 commonwealth.84.t:0 "Free Association Permitted"
 commonwealth.84.d:0 "The Provisional Federation of Delegates has in accordance with the IWW's stance on direct democracy, legalised free association. While there were elements of factionalism in the American People's Commonwealth and moderates were given a voice in local media, every single citizen was forced to either become a member of the AFL-CIO/IWW's political wing, the Democratic Labor Party, or remain apolitical. Prominent unionists within the Federation have proclaimed their government's official condemnation of such practice, labelling it tyrannical and fascistic in its most basic form. By tomorrow night, the American people will be legally permitted to join any party and associate with any movement they desire."
 commonwealth.84.o1:0 "Great"
 commonwealth.85.t:0 "[GetChomskyOrNot] Meets Military Leaders"
 commonwealth.85.d:0 "After long consultation sessions with different factions within the Federation of Delegates, [GetPresChomskyOrNot] has decided to meet with military leaders to discuss a new plan for the armed forces. While many pacifist allies of [GetChomskyOrNot] suggested that the army, air force and navy be completely disbanded no matter the cost to both our prestige and ability to defend the Federation, our President quickly declared [GetChomskySuccsessorHisOrHer] opposition. Instead, [GetChomskySuccsessorHeOrShe] decided to moderate between those simply wanting the military to remain as it was under the Commonwealth, and other factions that support a far more limited role. In the end, the plan that [ROOT.GetLeader] presented to commanders in Philadelphia detailed a 'military for defence' initiative. This initiative would drastically decrease the military budget and end any training exercises that prepared soldiers for invasion of other nations."
 commonwealth.85.o1:0 "Interesting"
 commonwealth.86.t:0 "Abolition of Wages"
 commonwealth.86.d:0 "During an extraordinary session of the Federation of Delegates, [GetPresChomskyOrNot] and [GetChomskySuccsessorHisOrHer] allies within the legislative body pushed forward a bill that would abolish wages totally but gradually. Such a proposal so early in the anarcho-syndicalist era of our nation came as a shock to many sitting in their seats, but eventually they became attracted to the points [GetChomskyOrNot] and Speaker Germaine Greer presented. Economic, social and political implications were all discussed thoroughly, and while opposition still remained within the room, there was a generally clear consensus among the majority that this bill should be passed. When the time came, only a ninth of the delegates voted against the measure, and wages were officially 'abolished'. Technically, the act of abolition will take place over many years in the future, but this is already a victory for [GetPresChomskyOrNot] and more radical factions within the Federation."
 commonwealth.86.o1:0 "One giant leap"
 commonwealth.87.t:0 "[GetChomskyOrNot] Meets Urban and Rural Delegates"
 commonwealth.87.d:0 "In the past few months, delegates from both urban and rural areas have expressed their dismay at supposed 'neglect' from Philadelphia. Clearly angered by the fact that anyone within [GetChomskySuccsessorHisOrHer] precious utopia could feel sidelined, [GetPresChomskyOrNot] himself called a meeting of all disgruntled rural and urban federation delegates in the capital. There [GetChomskySuccsessorHeOrShe] reassured them that [GetChomskySuccsessorHeOrShe] was working with every single member of the legislative body to deliver meaningful reforms across the entire country. He couldn't promise everything would come immediately, but the former Commonwealth president and leader of the anarcho-syndicalist movement in America made sure they knew there would be no more neglect coming from Philadelphia in any capacity. It seems the delegates left this meeting happy and certain that their demands would be met."
 commonwealth.87.o1:0 "Ok"
 commonwealth.88.t:0 "Provisional Federation Becomes Permanent"
 commonwealth.88.d:0 "Today the Provisional Federation of Delegates sung their last Warszawianka before officially becoming a permanent legislative and representative body. Domestic and international observers watched from above as [GetPresChomskyOrNot] signed the bill to dissolve this provisional federation, proceeding to clap ferociously alongside their representatives below. Just over ten speeches from delegates finalised ceremonies and new members who would overtake prominent retiring politicians were sworn in by Speaker Germaine Greer. Finally we have achieved the final goal of our anarcho-syndicalist movement, and the American people can be sure that we are working at our most efficient."
 commonwealth.88.o1:0 "Great"
 
 midwest.1.t:0 "The Modern Frontier"
 midwest.1.d:0 "America is a shell of its former self. Once the glowing beacon of freedom and prosperity, now a shattered land of poverty and instability. The Heartlands were the old 'Frontier', the border of European culture and the uncivilised Western lands, and it seems we now live within a modern Frontier. Originally the Heartlands were divided between two nations, the Great Plains Federation consisting of Kansas, Nebraska, and Colorado, and the short-lived Dakota Federation, formed out of North and South Dakota. The rapid takeover of much of North Dakota by Neo-Nazi militias was the catalyst for the Union's formation, as figures such as William Clinton and Wesley Clark, exiles from the South who grew disillusioned with the increasing Authoritarianism and Conservatism of the American Republic, pushed to create a new American government truly dedicated to the ideals of freedom and Liberty. However now, dust settles over our farms, the people search for new lands as their crops die and all states outside of the capital are lawless. We remain shut out of the world and trapped in this slowly decaying cage called the Heartlands. Can we break out of this cage or is lawlessness our unfortunate destiny?"
 midwest.1.o1:0 "Only time will tell"
 
 usa.118.t:0 "Duke Meets with Executives"
 usa.118.d:0 " Following a meeting with high-level executives from Canada, Duke has held a press conference this morning to address concerns about the path of his new administration. While many have supported a strongman authoritarian government with Duke at the helm, it seems the President has other plans. According to his statement, he is working tirelessly to bring back jobs and the upper classes back to America, in order to stimulate our economy. Thus, regulations are set to be slashed and the Dirigist policies of the Bush era are to be undone as we seek to make the South a true haven of the rich and powerful once more. Opponents to this new government have called such a statement outright support for fascistic corporatocracy, while others think that this policy is just what the South needs after decades of economic decline."

An American corporatocracy will restore control of our nation to those who can truly run it, not weak-willed politicians.
