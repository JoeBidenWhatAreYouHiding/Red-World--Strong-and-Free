 news.286.t:0 "Newt Gingrich Unites America"
 news.286.d:0 "As President Gingrich stood in Washington DC, waiting to be inaugurated as the first President of the United States since the Great Collapse, millions tuned in to watch the event from home and hundreds of thousands turned up to watch in person. As President Gingrich confirmed the unification of America, the nation let out a sudden and glorious cheer in celebration of the event. As Gingrich’s speech continued, he reinforced the values he was elected on by the Protestant clique that had overthrown the radical Mike Pence years prior: Family, God and the State. With Canada remaining neutral on this reunified America and the Warsaw Pact denouncing the state as a return of the old Reagan regime, it has become clear that America will remain isolated from all major powers, and perhaps seek to create its own alliance to rival that of the Democratic League and Warsaw Pact. With Christianity becoming a prominent talking point in daily American life, many have denounced Gingrich’s government for abandoning the principles of the first amendment. However, Gingrich has insisted that America has and will always remain a secular state."
 news.286.o1:0 "This new America is not that different from the old."

 ### Events ###
 
 usa.98.t:0 "Damaging Information Released"
 usa.98.d:0 "Since President George Bush Senior established a loyalist government in Atlanta, a cult of personality has circled around him and his family. Both brothers have been involved in high-profile, albeit unsuccessful bids for the Presidency, with George Jr. moving to Texas to manage his father's baseball team following his loss. However, it seems this cult of personality could come to a dramatic end with the release of highly damaging information. According to documents released by the Central Intelligence Agency, Vice President Bush, not Reagan, was the one who proposed dissolving the United States. Indeed, it was Bush, not Reagan, who caused the collapse of the United States. Reagan had proposed declaring Martial Law and implementing the Rex 84 plan, while Bush viewed a return to State authority as the best way to prevent further bloodshed. Only after Reagan declared the US's dissolution did Bush break from this position and attempt to rally loyal Governors in support of the Federal Government once he de-facto assumed the Presidency. While more in-depth details about these events are yet to be released, this comes as a shocking blow to the Republican party and Bush loyalists."

 usa.195.t:0 "Republican National Convention Deadlocked"
 usa.195.d:0 "Milley's warning seems to have been more accurate than even the most vocal naysayers in our administration could have predicted. That cocksucker Jeb Bush has managed to deadlock the convention. An insurgent ticket of Jeb Bush and Lindsay Graham have completely deadlocked the convention after numerous rounds of voting. State delegations are now threatening to walk out if their preferred candidate is not supported by prominent politicians who have yet to cast their ballots, and anarchy for the Party seems to be on the horizon. Prominent sources indicate that Jeb Bush may be about to start his own Independent Republican Campaign, with several state RNC delegations rumoured to be supporting Bush in the General Election instead of incumbent President Rumsfeld. We're right in the thick of it, and if we want to make it out of this mess in one piece, we're gonna have to get crafty. Ridge is toast, strong leadership is needed in this time of great uncertainty. Cheney, an old friend and protégé of President Rumsfeld is rumoured to be the President's first pick to replace Ridge, although rumours that 'Master of the Senate' Mitch McConnell has been tapped due to his deep ties to the Republican Political Machine.

 usa.181.t:0 "King Lucian I Calls Snap Election"
 usa.181.d:0 "Within the past few years, the American monarchy has radically changed, morphing from hereditary despotism under Mark Milley and Paul I to a true democratic system under an elected monarch of House Jefferson of Monticello. Following this reformation of our monarchy into an elective, federalist system, Lucian I Jefferson has called for new snap elections, with [Root.GetLeader] expected to run again.\n\nChallenging our current PM, however, lies many uniquely Jeffersonian candidates who claim to echo the values of our monarch, the most notable being the libertarian media personality and businessman Joe Exotic (Better known as the 'Tiger King'), echoing Jefferson's love for small government, and agrarian conservative Sonny Perdue. An economic liberal seeking to restore small government values, Exotic would like to see both the King and Congress leave social and economic freedoms to the people, while Sonny Perdue, a former agricultural baron and Republican has embraced a Jeffersonian populist ideal of the working farmer.\n\nThe People's Party and National Renewal Party, of course, have continued to remain involved in politics, but neither of their candidates have appeared uniquely Jeffersonian in an era of monarchy."

 usa.182.t:0 "King Douglas I Calls Snap Election"
 usa.182.d:0 "Within the past few years, the American monarchy has radically changed, morphing from hereditary despotism under Mark Milley and Paul I to a true democratic system under an elected monarch of House Hamilton, architects of a new America. Following this reformation of our monarchy into an elective, federalist system, Douglas I Hamilton has called for new snap elections, with [Root.GetLeader] expected to run again.\n\nChallenging our current PM, however, lies a candidate many expect would despise everything Hamilton stood for, small government libertarian and prominent media personality Joe Exotic, and representing the Independence Union's Hamiltonian wing, fiscal and social moderate Joe Manchin. An economic liberal seeking to restore small government values, Exotic would like to see both the King and Congress leave social and economic freedoms to the people, while Joseph Manchin, emblematic of a populist and moderate conservative appeal, echoes the hard-working, immigrant values of House Hamilton.\n\nThe People's Party and National Renewal Party, of course, have continued to remain involved in politics, but neither of their candidates have appeared uniquely Hamiltonian in an era of monarchy."

 usa.187.t:0 "Federalist Party Formed"
 usa.187.d:0 "To fill the void of the Republican Party, a new centrist party has risen, currently led by none other than the famed orator and politician turned staunch voice for monarchy, Barry Obama. Obama and his allies have formed the "Federalist Party", a group that pledges to uphold the monarchy as a new, core symbol of American life and reunify America under the banner of Paul I's United Kingdoms of America. A constitutionalist party, the Federalists advocate for further democratization within the monarchist system as a general principle, along with economic centrism and generally, social progressivism, if not extreme patriotism and nationalism for the American system. As the party expands, observers expect it to be divided between Obama's centrist monarchist wing, libertarians, such as the influential businessman and 'Tiger King' Joe Exotic, and former Democrats, like rising star John Bel Edwards."

 ### Focuses ###
 
 USA_corporatism:0 "Align Buisness Interests"
 USA_corporatism_desc:0 "The GOP has lost the world of Big Business due to the burden of Bushist overregulation, but they see an opportunity with President Duke. Isolated, floundering, and desperate for allies, it is clear that the Grand Wizard can be bought for the highest price. An American corporatocracy will restore control of our nation to those who can truly run it, not weak-willed politicians. Although many in the fascist movement will express anger at Duke from bending to corporate interests, it is clear that an America managed by corporations and businessmen will be more efficient than any democratic regime."
