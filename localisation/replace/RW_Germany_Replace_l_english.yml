 GER_RED_WORLD_DESC:0 "After being divided for nearly four decades, the two German states reunited in 1987 with much fanfare. Four years later Austria also joined the republic, now the dominant power in central Europe. Since then, the German Democratic Republic has maintained a strong military and economy, as well as a stable political system. As the strongest country in the European Union of Socialist Republics, many are beginning to suspect that Germany has become more powerful than the Soviet Union itself, influencing its European neighbors for its own gains. Could Germany become the successor to the fading Soviet world order?"

After World War II, Krupp was de-Nazified and rebuilt and diversified beyond its military roots, focusing on heavy machinery, engineering, and industrial equipment. Upon German Re-Unification, Krupp was abolished as a private entity by the DDR and renamed 'Krause' as a reference to the novel, film, and song 'Krupp & Krause'."

 ### Events ###
 
  decision_event.45.t:0 "Treaty of Strasbourg"
 decision_event.45.d:0 "The Treaty of Strasbourg, officially known as the Treaty Establishing the European Union of Socialist Republics, was a treaty signed by all core members of the European Communities. The treaty had its origins in the Crocodile Club established by Italian MEP Altiero Spinelli in 1980 to promote European integration and federalism. The group established the Committee on Institutional Affairs in 1982, tasked with drafting a constitution for the European Communities. Though the club started out as an informal cross-party group, Spinelli was a former member of the Italian Communist Party and the committee increasingly fell under the influence of its communist members, especially after the European elections in 1984. The committee presented the initial Draft Treaty to the European Parliament before the elections, and it was approved, but then rewritten after the Communist and Allies Group won a plurality of the seats in the parliament. The following months saw Communist-led governments come to power in nearly all EC members, as well as the reunification of Germany in 1987. This renewed interest for reform in Europe, leading to an alliance in the European Parliament between the Communist and Allies Group and the Socialist Group, which led negotiations alongside the European Commission and the national governments to draft the new treaty. On 27 October 1988, the Treaty of Strasbourg was signed by all members of the European Communities, except the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark, who were subsequently expelled from the newly-established European Union of Socialist Republics as per its founding treaty."
